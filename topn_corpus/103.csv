After four months since the signing of Ireland-Britain peace  initiative this is the first time ever that the two countries'  senior officials have launched a fresh effort for overcoming the  existing obstacles. Britain, which is one of the old parties to  the Northern Ireland dispute, through setting certain  preconditions for the participation of Sinn Fein, the political  wing of the Irish Republican Army, at their peace talks has  resulted in prompting this army to view their future peace talks  with pessimism, thus continuing its armed struggles [sentence as  received].    Britain, through setting a precondition for the Irish  Republican Army for putting an end to the armed struggles  without determining any obligation for London in connection with  the withdrawal of its forces, has drawn these talks to a  stalemate.    Political observers believe the presence of 12,000 British  troops as well as a 7,000 strong Ulster police in Northern  Ireland, which are considered as major opposition forces  antagonizing the IRA, are regarded as major obstacles to the  continuation of the peace talks process.    The British Government, contrary to its claims, based on its  interests in resolving the Northern Ireland dispute, still  insists on certain stands which are typical of the continuation  of Britain's dominance in Northern Ireland.    The British Government has hinted at the issue of self-rule  for Northern Ireland in its plan for peace initiative which  means that London refuses to accept the right to sovereignty for  Northern Ireland and is attempting to keep Northern Ireland as a  region under British dominance. Meanwhile, the Protestant  majority residing in Northern Ireland, that enjoys all-out  support and protection of Britain, is yet another obstacle to  the process of peace talks. In order to overcome it, Britain  has to adopt a stance taking into consideration the existing  realities.    Assuredly the British Government is no longer able to resort  to the past methods to suppress the IRA and seek to exercise  military power for the materialization of its political  objectives.    In the meantime, one should note that the IRA, in turn, now  does not see continuation of the armed struggle to be enough for  achieving its goals. That is because the Conservative and Labor  Governments in Britain have demonstrated that they have made  themselves invulnerable to the blows of the army and will  neutralize the effects of such measures and the government's  political decisions. With regard to the fact that the two sides  have obtained great experiences during more than two decades of  struggle, and also in view of the difficulties faced by each  side, it appears that one can assess the future of these talks  optimistically through the presentation of peaceful views by  each side.

Its stance underlined the differing emphases of the two governments over the next step to be taken in the Ulster peace process. Dublin is not planning an immediate response to the British government's latest proposals to renew round-table talks in Northern Ireland, but will make its own suggestions 'for additional areas of discussion' in the coming weeks. Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, described Sir Patrick's proposals as 'a checklist of relevant points in relation to the recommencement of talks', and emphasised that any new talks must be on the basis of the joint declaration and the three-strand talks that broke up without agreement in November 1992. Unease with the latest British proposals, which outline the creation of a new assembly in Northern Ireland, was underlined by a Dublin spokesman who said the Irish government 'will be making suggestions for additional areas of discussion'. Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, said that next week's UK-Irish summit in London will review progress on the joint declaration. The British and Irish prime ministers are due to meet on February 19 to attend the England-Ireland rugby match at Twickenham, and it is expected that Sir Patrick and Mr Spring will also be involved in the discussions. Ulster unionists last night reacted angrily to the news that Sir Patrick had already provided Dublin with the ideas he wants pursued. Mr Peter Robinson, the Democratic Unionist MP for east Belfast, said the disclosure that Britain had given details of its latest thinking to Dublin was an 'outrage' .

In a statement released in Dublin, the IRA leadership said it 'welcomed this initiative'. The IRA statement said: 'We are informed of the broad principles which will be for consideration by the London and Dublin governments. 'It is unfortunate that the British government reaction to this initiative so far has been negative, fuelling unionist reaction. Nonetheless if the political will exists or can be created, it could provide the basis for peace.' The statement added that the IRA, its members and supporters had a 'vested interest' in seeking a just and lasting peace in Ireland. But it stressed that they had not budged from their desire for an all-Ireland solution to the Ulster violence. The controversial talks between Ulster's Social Democratic and Labour party leader Mr John Hume and Sinn Fein leader Mr Gerry Adams gained momentum at the weekend after Mr Adams said he is prepared to present peace proposals to the IRA. He told the Irish Times: 'I am quite prepared to go to the IRA with a package if one can be produced. 'I would of course seek a package, which would allow me to make definitive proposals to the IRA in relation to the future conduct of its campaign. Whether I can do that or whether indeed the outcome would be acceptable to the IRA is a matter for all of us to apply ourselves to.' Last week Mr Hume and Mr Adams said they believed a broader negotiating process could begin which could lead 'to a stable and lasting peace'. A report by the two party leaders, containing a number of proposals, is to be discussed with the Irish government later this week when Mr Hume visits Dublin. The Irish government is expected to discuss this later with the British government.   Countries:-  IEZ   Ireland, EC.     GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P9721 International Affairs.

Answering questions in the Dail (Irish parliament) yesterday he quoted from the recent joint statement by Mr John Hume, the leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party, and Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein leader. He said: 'It is pretty clear that it is a peace process we are talking about . . . we are engaged in trying to find a formula for peace.' On the talks between Mr Hume and Mr Adams, Mr Reynolds said: 'I was fully aware of the objectives of those talks but not of the detail.' He and Mr Dick Spring, the foreign minister, are to be told those details in a full briefing from Mr Hume later today, and will consider the proposals that Mr Hume and Mr Adams have come up with. Mr Reynolds said loyalist paramilitaries in the province have declared their violence to be reactive to that of the IRA, and that if the IRA stops its campaign then the loyalists would stop theirs. Mr Hume and Mr Adams have been holding bilateral talks since last April, which Mr Hume has stated are aimed at achieving a 'total cessation of all violence'. Mr Reynolds attempted to damp expectations that there would be a prompt publication of the proposals. He said: 'I want to ask for restraint and patience from this house and the public in general. There is no overnight solution . . . I don't think that making every detail public would be helpful to achieving a settlement.' He has a meeting scheduled with Mr John Major, the British prime minister, before the end of the year, and added: 'If a further meeting becomes necessary before then, then I shall seek one.' The Northern Ireland Office had not fully digested the detail of Mr Reynolds' statements last night, but a spokesman said: 'The way forward as we see it is to get the (round-table) talks going again, and if any document is presented to us by the Irish government then we will consider it.' Pressed by opposition leaders as to whether the Irish government is prepared to amend its constitutional claim to Northern Ireland, which Unionists say is the main impediment to any progress, Mr Reynolds insisted that there will be no unilateral move by Dublin.

Officials said yesterday that a 'full debate' was anticipated on the peace process at the party conference, to be held in Dublin, and a definitive Sinn Fein response to the Downing Street declaration could not be ruled out - although it was 'unlikely in current circumstances'. The party's national executive has put forward an emergency motion welcoming the Irish government's approach to the Downing Street declaration and 'its positive and commonsense attitude to the need to provide clarification'. It calls on the British government 'to join the ranks of the persuaders' and reiterates Sinn Fein's demand for British clarification of the peace process. A Sinn Fein official said this would require face-to-face talks and for the British government to say whether it was considering an eventual withdrawal from Northern Ireland. Mr Danny Morrison, a senior IRA prisoner in the Maze prison in Northern Ireland, said that, if the British became 'persuaders' of unionists in the province 'to accept reconciliation with the rest of the Irish people,' this would result in a rethinking of the Republican movement's strategy. Other important issues to be debated at the conference are policy papers on the European Union and the economic effects of a united Ireland.   Countries:-  IEZ  Ireland, EC.

He and other Sinn Fein leaders spent three hours with Mr Bruce Morrison, a former US congressman, and five other prominent Irish-Americans, who received a detailed briefing on the peace process from the Irish prime minister and foreign minister on Thursday. Although on a private visit, the US delegation will report back to the White House when it returns to the US next week. After yesterday's meeting Mr Adams said: 'We can look forward to the peace process moving on as a result of these discussions and deliberations.' Sinn Fein believes the Irish-American lobby in the US will have a key role to play in the months ahead, especially in the context of a widely expected imminent IRA ceasefire. The British and Irish governments have emphasised that Sinn Fein will be admitted to round-table political talks only in the event of a permanent end to IRA violence. But politicians on both sides of the border acknowledge that an extended IRA ceasefire will put them under pressure to respond positively, if there is to be any chance of a temporary ceasefire being turned into a permanent one. That is why Sinn Fein sees the powerful Irish-American lobby in the US as having a role in helping to shape US government policy on Ireland, and in turn influencing development of the peace process. Mr Morrison said that he had been 'very encouraged' by yesterday's meeting with the Sinn Fein leadership and that he believed the peace process was moving 'in a very positive direction'. Mr Morrison's delegation is to meet leaders from the Social Democratic and Labour party (SDLP) and the Alliance party, but has been snubbed by the two main unionist parties, the UUP and the DUP.

Mr Major told the Lord Mayor's banquet in the City of London that 'there may now be a better opportunity for peace in Northern Ireland than for many years'. He ruled out secret deals with terrorists, and insisted that the government would 'never' talk to organisations which declined to renounce violence. 'But if the IRA ends violence for good then, after a sufficient interval to ensure the permanence of their intent - Sinn Fein can enter the political arena as a democratic party and join the dialogue on the way ahead.' In his most optimistic appraisal yet of the prospects for Northern Ireland, Mr Major said there was a 'burning desire on each side of the community for peace'. He said the Irish government had shown 'a new understanding of the rights and concerns of unionists,' and most of the constitutional parties in Northern Ireland were 'purposefully' engaged in talks about a settlement. All the parties accepted that flexibility was needed, and that 'cherished positions' would have to be modified. 'These elements present the opportunity we are determined to pursue,' he said. Downing Street said the prime minister's words were intended as an 'explicit' demonstration that the government was 'very serious' about the peace process. 'Northern Ireland is something which the prime minister intends to keep on the front burner,' a senior official said. The speech also confirms that the UK government is prepared to press ahead without the participation of the hardline Democratic Unionist party, led by the Rev Ian Paisley, which has said it will 'never' talk to Sinn Fein, even after a cessation of IRA violence. The possibility that the British and Irish governments might be willing to talk to Sinn Fein was first raised in a joint declaration in Brussels last month by Mr Major and Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister. However, Downing Street said Mr Major's declaration last night clarified the government's position. 'It has never been explicit, as it is here,' said a senior official. The government dismissed reports in Northern Ireland newspapers that the government had held recent talks on a ceasefire with Sinn Fein or IRA leaders.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

'I don't think Gerry Adams is going to split the US and the UK to put it mildly,' a spokesman said. But it urged the US government to put pressure on the Sinn Fein president to use the controversial visit to announce an end to violence. In New York Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, said it was 'an American decision entirely'. Last week London said it hoped a visa would not be given to Mr Adams unless he made 'a clear and unequivocal renunciation of violence'. US officials believe Mr Adams's visit could strengthen his position within the Irish republican movement thereby helping those willing to move towards peace talks to control the more extreme members of their organisations. A group of about 40 members of Congress had been pressing President Bill Clinton to grant Mr Adams a visa to attend a conference in New York today on the prospects for peace in Northern Ireland, arguing that this could contribute to the peace process by enhancing his influence over the rank and file membership of the IRA. 'The visa won't ensure that, but it's a calculated gamble to raise his prestige against some of his party's extremists,' a congressional official said. 'What is the worst that can happen? If it doesn't work and they go back to terrorism he doesn't get in again,' he added. White House officials said the intention behind the visa authorisation was to 'reach out to him and his organisation to encourage them to work within the peace process'. The House of Representatives' Speaker Thomas Foley, Congress's most prominent member of Irish extraction, was opposed last week to granting Mr Adams a visa. However most of the Friends of Ireland, a congressional caucus whose leaders include Congressman Frank McCloskey of Indiana and Senator Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts, have strongly urged Mr Clinton to agree to Mr Adams's visa request. In 1992, during a hard-fought primary election in New York state, Mr Clinton told a gathering of Irish-Americans he thought it would be 'totally harmless to our national security and would widen the political debate in this country' to grant a visa to Mr Adams. Two days later, however, Mr Adams lost his seat in the British parliament, offering Mr Clinton an excuse for not fulfilling that promise when Mr Adams applied for a visa last summer. While US officials maintain a degree of scepticism about the likelihood of any imminent breakthrough towards peace in Northern Ireland, they also see real hope in last month's joint declaration by Mr John Major and Mr Albert Reynolds, the British and Irish prime ministers.

In the wake of the assertion by Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, that the British government may never be in a position to say it accepts that the IRA ceasefire is permanent, Mr Reynolds told the Dublin parliament he was convinced that the end of IRA violence was 'real and for good'. He said he would be in touch with Mr John Major later this week to explain 'that we believe the peace process should be consolidated and underpinned at the earliest possible moment because if any vacuums develop, the process could be endangered - and we don't want to see that happen'. Mr Reynolds also said he was 'encouraged' by signs of a loyalist ceasefire. There was fresh optimism in Northern Ireland last night within the fringes of the paramilitaries after the Government allowed loyalist leaders into the top-security Maze Prison on Monday for talks about a possible ceasefire with UDA and UVF inmates. Mr Reynolds, replying to a series of questions on the search for peace in Northern Ireland, told the parliament of his forthcoming contact with Mr Major: 'I will be making the point that I believe the time has come now, into the sixth week of the cessation of violence, to accelerate the response of the British government. 'Also that the British government should use whatever pressures they can in relation to an end of violence by loyalist paramilitaries.' But he also made clear that Sinn Fein had been told that Dublin disapproved of the steep rise in punishment beatings carried out by republican hardliners since the ceasefire began on September 1. Mr Reynolds said it was expected that a framework for all-party, cross-border talks would be completed ahead of a meeting soon with Mr Major. 'The intention is that the discussions and negotiations on the document will be over before we fix a definitive date for the meeting,' he said.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Their decision, which could result in a lengthy phase of political instability in the republic, raises concerns about the momentum of the Northern Ireland peace process. The resignations were followed later in the day by that of Mr Harry Whelehan as president of the High Court. He said he was quitting because 'the judiciary must enjoy total and unquestioning public respect'. Mr Reynolds, in his resignation speech, told the parliament: 'You win some - and you lose some. But, above all, throughout my life I have been delighted to have been a risk-taker.' Former attorney-general Mr Whelehan's judicial appointment triggered the collapse of the 22-month old coalition on Wednesday. Labour had accused Mr Reynolds of misleading parliament over the delayed extradition to Northern Ireland of a Catholic priest, later convicted of child abuse. Mr Whelehan's resignation introduced an unexpected twist to a day of high political drama in Dublin, raising the prospect that Mr Reynolds might try to hang on to the party leadership. Last night his position as party leader was still unclear after it emerged that a meeting of the Fianna Fail parliamentary party had not accepted his resignation. A meeting to resolve the party leadership issue is expected to be held tomorrow. Two candidates last night declared their intention to fight for the leadership. Mrs Maire Geoghegan-Quinn, the justice minister, said that she would be offering her candidacy if Mr Reynolds were to step down. Mr Bertie Ahern, until yesterday the finance minister, also announced he planned to stand. Ireland, for the time being, is in the hands of a caretaker government. With little prospect of an early resolution to the crisis, there are growing doubts about the pace of talks between Dublin and London on the vital framework document for a constitutional settlement to Northern Ireland's political problems. In London, Mr John Major, who was informed of Mr Reynolds' resignation during a morning cabinet meeting, wrote to thank him for his contribution to the peace process. Downing Street said the prime minister was sorry that his 'extremely good' working relationship with his former Irish counterpart was at an end. He intended to speak to Mr Reynolds before the end of the week. But as Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican Army, used a visit to London to accuse Britain of dragging its feet on efforts to forge a lasting settlement in Ulster, senior UK ministers insisted that the peace process would continue. Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, told parliament the process did not 'depend on any individual'. The government would 'press ahead' with exploratory talks with Sinn Fein and loyalist representatives next month. Downing Street said the two governments were 'close to agreement' on the framework document which would form the basis of future talks involving Ulster's main political parties. Mr Adams appeared sceptical. The process of trying to reach agreement had been going on 'for months and months', he said. The prospect of a protracted search for a new Irish government - and possibly an early general election - could dangerously delay the joint framework document. In the confusion generated by the day's resignations, however, it was not clear that a new general election would even be necessary. Mr Dick Spring, the Labour leader, said he had 'an open mind' on all possibilities for forming another coalition.

The move came as the London and Dublin governments signalled their determination to press ahead with talks on the province's future irrespective of whether the republican movement agrees to embrace the UK-Irish peace initiative. Mr Adams said the decision to retain his ban was 'a gratuitous reaffirmation of John Major's arrogant refusal to engage meaningfully and positively' in the peace process. Republican leaders have still not given a definitive response to last month's Downing Street declaration. The British government now believes that the odds are stacked heavily against an early end to IRA violence. Downing Street said yesterday that talks - co-ordinated by Mr Michael Ancram, Northern Ireland minister - had continued this week with a meeting with the Ulster Unionists. Mr Ancram is to meet representatives of the mainly Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party later this month. A 40-minute meeting at Downing Street between Mr John Major, the prime minister, and Mr John Hume, the SDLP leader, yesterday failed to bridge differences between them over whether London should respond to Sinn Fein's demands for clarification of last month's joint declara-tion. But Mr Hume left the 'very constructive' meeting in a relatively upbeat mood. He was 'very, very encouraged' by the fact that Ulster remained at the top of Mr Major's agenda. Appealing for patience, Mr Hume said he still thought peace was very possible. He added: 'I do not have a gloomy prospect.' Downing Street said it welcomed Mr Hume's strong support for the joint declaration. Mr Major was keeping in close contact with leaders of the other constitutional parties.

Both papers were prepared after talks between civil servants from both governments over the past two months. Final drafts from both sides are expected to provide the basis for a statement from the British and Irish prime ministers, tentatively scheduled for early December. This would provide a blueprint for a peace settlement in Northern Ireland and a basis for resuming round-table political talks in the province. The document is not a final draft, and has not been politically cleared at the top level. Indeed Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, yesterday said it had no connection with the peace process. Nonetheless the document is the clearest indication yet of what is seen in Dublin as a basis for a political settlement. It also indicates the concessions Dublin is seeking from the British government in return for dropping its territorial claim to the province. Its main points are: Both governments must 'be open to change' in their 'constitutional doctrines' relating to Ulster to reflect more accurately the divided loyalties there, and would be required to 'encourage the process of agreement among all the people who inhabit the island'. Both governments would recognise 'the legitimacy of the two major traditions that exist in Ireland  - those who wish for no change in the present status of Northern Ireland, and those who wish for a sovereign united Ireland achieved by peaceful means and by agreement'. A downgrading of Dublin's constitutional claim to Northern Ireland  - to an aspiration  - would be balanced by Britain acknowledging 'the full legitimacy and value of the goal of Irish unity by agreement, cherished by the greater number of people living in Ireland'. 'Objective meaningful expression and opportunity' to the aspiration of unification would be created through new Anglo-Irish structures and by incorporation of special provisions into any new devolved government structures in Northern Ireland. A new devolved administration in the province 'would assume executive and legislative responsibilities over a wide range of subjects (but) must secure widespread acceptance throughout both communities'. New north-south institutions mandated by both parliaments 'to discharge or oversee a range of executive functions' to be 'administered uniformly throughout the island'. These functions could be expanded by agreement with the new devolved administration. These institutions would provide the framework for north-south co-operation, especially 'for developing an integrated approach for the whole island in respect of the challenges and opportunities of the EC'. They would be subject to parliamentary scrutiny, 'including any new inter-parliamentary forum which may be set up by agreement between elected representatives north and south'. A standing UK-Irish conference would 'guarantee and monitor' a new agreement, and would have 'contingency powers of intervention and redress' in the event that devolved power structures in the province failed to abide by their obligations. Majority consent in Northern Ireland to any change in its status would be constitutionally guaranteed by the republic in a new agreement. The majority in Northern Ireland are fully recognised to have a right 'to withhold consent for any such change unless and until they are persuaded by democratic political means only, free from coercion and violence'. Negotiations on a political settlement would be only between those 'committed exclusively to constitutional methods and not with organisations who use, threaten or support violence for political ends'. Organisations which have 'demonstrably expressed their commitment to the democratic process by renouncing violence' would be entitled to a role in negotiations. Any new agreement would require endorsement by 'the people'  - an oblique reference to an all-Ireland referendum. It is thought the document has elements of the peace plans formulated by Mr John Hume, Social Democratic and Labour party leader, and Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein leader.

In his second statement in two days, Mr Adams criticised London and Dublin for 'contradictory statements' on the issue of self-determination. He said the peace process would be 'difficult, dangerous and protracted'. Downing Street brushed aside Mr Adams' demands, saying it would not 'enter into exchanges with Sinn Fein through the media'. Both British and Irish officials said Sinn Fein's inclusion in talks was 'predicated upon a true cessation of violence'. Mr David Trimble, Ulster Unionist home affairs spokesman, described Mr Adams' comments as a 'cynical manoeuvre' to try to 'suck the government into direct negotiations while violence is continuing'. However, the gulf between the province's two unionist parties was reflected in a comment by Mr Peter Robinson, deputy leader of the Democratic Unionist party. He accused the Ulster Unionist party of 'prostituting' itself by going along with the initiative. Mr Adams said Sinn Fein would not be 'intimidated by any threats'. But he expressed optimism that 'if properly managed' a process to bring lasting peace could be established. He said Sinn Fein wanted to make the Major-Reynolds declaration 'the beginning of the end'. Downing Street said there was 'no question' of Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, attending talks that the British government has offered Sinn Fein within three months of an end to violence. Fifty-six per cent of people in Northern Ireland approve the joint declaration, according to an ITN poll released last night. However, twice as many nationalists (87 per cent) as unionists (43 per cent) give it their support. A total of 61 per cent said they would vote in a referendum for the province to remain in the UK, with 25 per cent supporting the idea of it becoming part of an all-Ireland republic.

Speaking on the eve of the first visit to parliament for more than a decade by Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, the prime minister said the government would begin talks next month with both the IRA's political wing and loyalist representatives - 'so long as the ceasefire is maintained'. It is understood that the talks with Sinn Fein will probably begin first. The prime minister assured MPs that Northern Ireland remained at the top of the government's priorities, but said there was still 'a long way to go' before peace in the province was secure. He said good progress had been made in discussions with the Irish government on the joint framework document that will form the basis of talks involving Ulster's main political parties. The document would contain proposals for a locally elected Ulster assembly and suggest a framework for cross-border structures to handle north-south relations. But he emphasised that the framework document would not be 'a straitjacket'. It was not a 'London-Dublin deal' that was set to be imposed, he said. Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader, expressed 'cautious optimism' on the province's future and promised that Labour would continue to support the peace process. Mr Major's remarks came as leading unionists made clear they would not be sorry to see the departure of Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, if he fails to hold on to his premiership. Mr David Trimble, the Ulster Unionist party's legal spokesman, said: 'In a sense almost anyone would be better than Albert Reynolds.' Mr Trimble added: 'As we see it Mr Reynolds . . . has been trying to get quick results. He has been trying to force the pace of peace negotiations and creating an air of crisis.' He rejected the idea that Fine Gael, the main opposition party in Dublin, is more pro-unionist than Mr Reynolds' Fianna Fail. Mr Ian Paisley Jnr, of the hardline Democratic Unionist party, said the peace process would continue whatever government was in power in Dublin. Mr David Ervine of the Progressive Unionist party, which speaks for some loyalist paramilitaries, said a change of government in the republic would not damage the peace process.

Downing Street responded sharply to suggestions by Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, that peace could be achieved by Christmas if the two governments focused on a cessation of violence followed by talks with Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing. Officials said Mr John Major had ruled out 'secret agreements on a ceasefire with violent organisations', and was 'wary of false optimism' in Dublin. Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, suggested the timetable outlined by Mr Reynolds could hinder the peace process. 'I don't think that this is a process that will benefit from governments saying that this must be achieved in a fortnight, or that must be achieved in a month,' he said. Sir Patrick tried to minimise the significance of the differences between Mr Reynolds and Mr Major by insisting that it was 'a mistake to look for evidence of disagreement between the two governments. There is none'. Mr Reynolds responded swiftly to the British comments. He said in a statement that 'peace cannot wait'. He added: 'Time is not on our side.' The exchanges reflect simmering differences between London and Dublin over the framework for the peace process, which was launched by the two governments in Brussels two weeks ago. Britain wants round-table discussions involving the two governments and Northern Ireland's four non-violent political parties, which are in the middle of bilateral talks with Mr Major. The British government insists that Sinn Fe'in should be included in the talks only after a permanent and unconditional cessation of IRA violence. The Irish government favours a separate peace process in which talks would focus on achieving an IRA ceasefire, followed by the inclusion of Sinn Fein in talks. Irish support for this strategy has hardened since the annual conference of the governing Fianna Fail party at the weekend revealed strong grass roots support for peace proposals put forward by Mr John Hume, SDLP leader, and Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein. However, the Hume-Adams proposals, which called for a ceasefire followed by talks with Sinn Fein, have been rejected by the British government. Sir Patrick repeated the British approach yesterday in the House Magazine, a journal produced for MPs, saying: 'The government will never negotiate with those who support threaten or perpetrate violence, or who fail to show their disavowal of such evil is for real.' Three men were remanded in custody by a special court in Limavady, Co Londonderry, charged with the murders of seven people shot dead 10 days ago in the Rising Sun bar in nearby Greysteel. They were also charged with membership of the Ulster Freedom Fighters and with possession of firearms. One was further charged with the murder of four Catholic workmen at Castlerock, Co Londonderry, in March.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.     IEZ  Ireland, EC.

Mr Dick Spring, foreign affairs minister, urged Unionist parties to return to the negotiating table. 'I want to see an accommodation on the constitutional issue which is reasonable and fair to all,' he said. The reaction in Whitehall was cautiously upbeat. Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, hopes the new Irish government will help end the political deadlock in the province. But Mr Spring's overtures were given a chilly response by Unionist leaders, suggesting any breakthrough remains elusive. Nonetheless, it is the most affirmative statement yet by the Irish government that it is willing to embark on some sort of compromise with Northern Ireland's Unionist majority. It was the first keynote speech by Mr Spring, the Labour party leader, on the Northern Ireland issue since he took office in January as part of the new coalition. Mr Spring would appear to be asserting the stamp of his party, which has one third of the seats in the cabinet, on the country's foreign policy. All-party talks on Northern Ireland, embracing the UK and Irish governments and the four main constitutional parties in Northern Ireland, broke down last November. The Unionists insist the republic must drop its territorial claim to the north if progress is to be made. Mr Spring said yesterday that his government was committed to the principle, laid out in the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement, that there would be no change in the status of Northern Ireland without the consent of the majority there. 'We will be quite ready to confirm and elaborate that principle in various ways as Unionists might wish, in any new agreement that transcends the Anglo-Irish Agreement,' he said, adding that the constitution was never intended to be an obstacle to mutual understanding. Mr Spring said: 'We clearly see the need to get around the table to work out how a generally acceptable package might fairly accommodate the deep divisions, including the divisions on constitutional issues, which are the source of the conflict.' He also proposed a new agreement or covenant. Mr Spring hinted that he might be prepared to travel to Belfast to restart bilateral negotiations with the Unionists, and added: 'We must at some time reach the point where all of us around a table can say to each other: this is a very difficult for us, but it is a just and fair compromise.' Mr Peter Robinson, deputy leader of the Democratic Unionist Party in Northern Ireland, responded negatively, to the offer, saying: 'Between my door and his door there is a road which has a very large obstacle placed on it, which he alone and his country can remove - that must be the priority. 'He has to face up to the reality that you cannot have a new relationship until the Irish Republic removes its claim to our territory.'   Countries:-  IEZ  Ireland, EC.     GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, said on Irish radio that reports of British concessions on the constitutional issue were 'ill-informed nonsense'. He confirmed that the Irish government was willing to offer a written pledge to hold a referendum - but only as part of an overall settlement. The talks were still 'firmly on course' in spite of serious disagreements exposed on Friday. He added, however, that time might be running out for a deal. Mr Reynolds said later in a television interview that Ireland was halfway to peace. Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, bluntly rejected suggestions that Britain agreed to compromise on the Irish claim to Ulster during talks in Dublin on Friday. He said there had been 'no softening on any point of principle. The principle here - and this is the key to the whole thing - is consent.' Mr Hurd said the talks between Mr John Major, the British prime minister, and Mr Reynolds had gone through some 'rough passages'. But there was agreement on both sides that the future of Northern Ireland would remain firmly in the hands of the people of the province. His remarks were intended to reassure unionists that the government would not accept any deal which failed to include an Irish referendum on articles 2 and 3 of the republic's constitution, which lay claim to Northern Ireland. Officials said the government's position might have been misinterpreted because of confusion about the form a peace agreement might take. One suggestion is that the first paper produced by the talks would be restricted to a general statement of principles, intended to sustain the momentum of the process. It would be followed by a more detailed paper in which the republic would be expected to offer guarantees that a referendum on the disputed articles would form part of an overall peace agreement.

It is understood that the talks with Sinn Fein will probably begin first. Sinn Fein last night said it regretted the failure of the parties in the Irish republic's coalition government to agree to stay in office together so that they could continue with their joint programme, particularly in the 'vital area' of the Ulster peace process. But at Westminster the Rev Martin Smyth, Ulster Unionist MP for Belfast South, said: 'I would have thought it would have no significant effect on the peace process because all the politicians in Dublin are signed up to it.' The prime minister assured MPs that Northern Ireland remained at the top of the government's priorities, but said there was still 'a long way to go' before peace in the province was secure.

0,FT934-1537 ,"FT934-1537 _AN-DLSAAAA9FT 931218   FT  18 DEC 93 / Dublin 'forum' to speed Sinn Fein involvement      By TIM COONE      DUBLIN   The Irish government's proposal to establish a 'peace forum' - referred to in this week's joint UK-Irish declaration - is aimed at bringing Sinn Fein rapidly into a formal negotiating process after the IRA has announced the ending of violence. Senior cabinet ministers say Sinn Fein could be brought into the Irish forum 'very quickly' after an announcement. This would be before the exploratory talks the British government has offered the party, which would start after a three-month 'quarantine' period. The ministers also echoed the British government's view that a surrender of IRA weapons would not be a precondition to the involvement of Sinn Fein in talks. Mr Albert Reynolds, the taoiseach, told the Dail yesterday: 'The joint declaration was the first stage in the peace process. The Forum for Peace and Reconciliation could be absolutely vital to reaching a second stage, and to achieving a permanent cessation of violence. 'If we want to be realistic, we have to guarantee that there will be a political process, once violence is permanently ended. The forum could provide a useful input to wider negotiations.' The creation of such a forum was one of the main sticking points in the drafting of the joint declaration. Irish government officials say it was therefore decided to make it an Irish initiative, rather than a joint initiative with Britain. Mr Reynolds said the forum would be modelled on the New Ireland Forum, set up in 1983 on the initiative of Mr John Hume, the leader of the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party in Northern Ireland, in which all the main parties in the Republic and the SDLP participated, but which the unionist parties in the north boycotted. Mr Reynolds said the new forum would be open 'to democratically mandated parties to provide a means to debate and devise appropriate alternative political strategies to violence'. Apparently acknowledging that unionist parties will not initially wish to be involved, he said the debate would take place 'among all strands of nationalism and hopefully a wider range of opinion, (and) in the aftermath of a permanent cessation of violence, could be a very healthy exercise in advance of resumed talks between all political parties, unionist and nationalist'. Dublin sees the forum as providing a 'bridge' to exploratory Sinn Fein talks with London and to subsequent wider talks involving all parties in Northern Ireland and the Republic. Dublin believes the move is necessary if Sinn Fein and the IRA are to accept the peace initiative. Issues of concern to Sinn Fein and the IRA, such as the future of IRA prisoners and the 'dumping' of arms, would be dealt with in these initial talks. Mr John Bruton, leader of the opposition Fine Gael party, expressed reservations. 'A forum that does not contain representatives of both traditions cannot achieve the stated objective in the joint declaration to promote reconciliation. There is a risk that some form of institutionalisation of division may be established.' The Irish parliament later backed the joint declaration without a vote at the end of a day-long debate in the Dail. Winding up the Dail debate, Mr Dick Spring, the deputy premier and foreign minister, said he would brief fellow members of the EC's General Affairs Council in Brussels on Monday.

Their statement came as Mr John Major and Mr Albert Reynolds responded to the escalating violence in the province by announcing a new drive towards a political settlement. A joint communique issued by the two leaders after talks in Brussels said there could be no question of contacts with terrorists, but that 'new doors' would open if the IRA and its supporters renounced violence for good. In his most explicit recognition yet of a potential role for Sinn Fein, Mr Major agreed that the political wing of the IRA could eventually be brought into the peace process. The two governments said they would 'respond imaginatively' to a permanent cessation of violence. However, the British and Irish prime ministers rejected as a basis for peace the conclusions of recent talks between Mr John Hume of the SDLP and Mr Gerry Adams of Sinn Fein. There could be 'no question' of the two governments adopting or endorsing Mr Hume's report of the dialogue. Details of those talks were reported yesterday for the first time to Mr Major by Mr Reynolds. At the end of a week of the worst sectarian violence for two decades, the two leaders condemned the tit-for-tat killings by terrorists from the Catholic and Protestant communities. Their communique attacked the 'murderous and premeditated acts which could serve no end other than to deepen the bloodshed in Northern Ireland'. Mr Major and Mr Reynolds reaffirmed their determination to restart the stalled negotiating process designed to bring a permanent political settlement to the province. Their cautiously upbeat tone followed the Dublin government's acknowledgement earlier this week of the right of the Unionist community to exercise a permanent veto on changes in Ulster's constitutional status. Both sides confirmed that the essence of any agreement would be a move by the Republic to replace its constitutional claim to the province with the aspiration of a united Ireland. Britain in return would offer a significant extension of cross-border administration. But the communique glossed over significant differences on the extent to which elements of the Hume-Adams peace initiative could be incorporated into their own negotiations. Mr Reynolds told Mr Major that they could not ignore the potential for a cessation of violence by the IRA in return for a place at the negotiating table for Sinn Fein. But, speaking after their talks, Mr Major said there could be 'no talks or negotiations between democratic governments and those who use, threaten or support violence'.

For the first time Mr Major spelled out explicitly that his government would be willing to bring Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, into peace negotiations. He was adamant that this would be possible only if the IRA renounced permanently the use of violence and demonstrated over 'a period' its commitment never to return to terrorism. As both leaders acknowledged the growing pressure on London and Dublin - and on the constitutional parties in Ulster - to fill the political vacuum, they said in a joint communique that the first principle of any settlement was: 'The situation in Northern Ireland should never be changed by violence or the threat of violence.' They added: 'Any political settlement must depend on consent freely given in the absence of force or intimidation.' Negotiations could only take place between governments and parties committed exclusively to constitutional methods. There could be no talks or negotiations between their governments and 'those who use, threaten or support violence for political ends'. The two leaders then reinforced that condition by stressing that there would be no agreements with organisations supporting violence. All parties claiming a serious interest in advancing the cause of peace in Ireland should renounce the support for violence. But in language that reflected the Dublin government's view that the republican paramilitaries must be persuaded to stop the fighting, the communique added: 'If and when such a renunciation of violence had been made and sufficiently demonstrated, new doors could open, and both governments would want to respond imaginatively to the new situation which would arise.' Pledging to press ahead with their own efforts to secure negotiations between the constitutional parties in Northern Ireland, Mr Major and Mr Reynolds added that the two governments would work together on a new 'framework for peace, stability and reconciliation'. They added that such an initiative could only be taken by the two governments. London and Dublin acknowledged the 'courageous efforts' of Mr John Hume, the leader of the mainly Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party. But there was 'no question' of the report he had drawn up after his talks with Mr Gerry Adams, the leader of Sinn Fein, being adopted or endorsed. Last night Sinn Fein was non-committal on the statement by the two prime ministers, saying only that leaders of the party were planning to study it in detail over the weekend.

In a toughly worded interview Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, ruled out a unionist veto on constitutional change, and demanded British action to 'persuade' unionists to accept Irish unity. Mr Adams told The Observer newspaper that 'the unionists will not move, and we cannot expect them to move, until the British persuade them to. They have no right of a veto over any policy'. His comments suggest a hardening of the Sinn Fein response to the Anglo-Irish joint declaration on Northern Ireland, which gives the unionists an explicit veto on constitutional change. However, Mr Adams also acknowledged that a united Ireland could not be achieved without the participation of the unionist majority in Northern Ireland. In a separate statement issued in Belfast, Mr Adams repeated demands for 'clarification' of the joint declaration, which offers Sinn Fein a place at the negotiating table within three months of a permanent IRA ceasefire. The statement said Mr Major's refusal to clarify the declaration was 'an abdication of his responsibilities and a clear indication that he has no real commitment to building the peace process'. It said Sinn Fein was prepared to 'assist' Mr Major to bring about peace. 'The sooner he stops play-acting and stringing this out, the sooner we can all move towards an end to conflict and towards a new beginning.' Downing Street said a letter setting out Sinn Fein's request for clarification had not been received. But Mr Major made clear that no clarification would be offered. Mr Major told Sir David Frost on BBC Television that he was prepared to wait 'for a little while' for a definitive republican response to the joint declaration. But he said the government would not be 'drawn into negotiations by the back door' by responding to questions from Sinn Fein in advance of a permanent IRA ceasefire. 'What at present is going on is that they are seeking to muddy (the) issue, to enter into negotiations effectively without giving up violence,' he said. 'That is not on offer. They do have to give up violence and then the way forward to a democratic future is perfectly clear, and the way forward for them to get into the talks about the democratic future for Northern Ireland is perfectly clear.' Mr Major said the three-stranded talks process between London, Dublin and Belfast, which began in 1992, would be intensified whatever Sinn Fein's response to the joint declaration.

Mr John Hume, SDLP leader, met the prime minister yesterday evening and outlined his party's position on the renewal of the talks. He sought reassurance from Mr Major that no secret 'deal' had been struck between the Conservatives and the Ulster Unionist party. Mr Hume has said that any such unilateral deal outside of the established negotiating process would wreck peace talks in the province, and would seriously undermine his talks with Mr Gerry Adams, the leader of Sinn Fein, which he says are aimed at bringing about 'a total cessation of all violence'.

But on the eve of the second meeting within a week between Mr John Major, the British prime minister, and Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, officials conceded that Dublin's demand for a new all-Ireland convention was a crucial stumbling block.

Those guarantees would centre on explicit recognition by Dublin that any change in the province's status could be achieved only by consent and a commitment by the Republic to drop its constitutional claim to the north. It is understood that Britain has agreed to recognise the legitimacy and validity of the nationalist aspiration of Irish unity and to repeat publicly the offer to Sinn Fein of a place in negotiations in return for an end to violence. Mr Major may also reaffirm that his government has no strategic interest in maintaining Northern Ireland as part of the union, and signal its willingness to accept separate referenda in the north and south on any political settlement. But the British side has rejected as unacceptable to the unionist parties the establishment of an all-Ireland convention and is resisting Dublin's demands to acknowledge publicly the right of self-determination across Ireland. The uncertain reaction of the IRA to any declaration was underlined by Mr Gerry Adams, the leader of Sinn Fein. At a party meeting in Belfast yesterday he defined the key issues for a total cessation of violence as 'sovereignty, self-determination for the people of Ireland, and the role of the British government in assisting in a process of national reconciliation'. He said Sinn Fein's involvement in political talks 'is not the main issue at this time'. He said the republican movement was not about to surrender, but added: 'We have taken risks and are prepared to take further risks to achieve a lasting peace . . . The opportunity for peace presented by the Irish peace initiative remains intact if it is seized and built upon and if Dublin puts the onus on Britain to deliver'.

Details of the initiative are still private, but Mr Albert Reynolds, the Taoiseach (Irish prime minister), and Mr Dick Spring, the foreign minister, are expected to discuss them with Mr Hume tomorrow in Dublin, when he arrives after a nine-day visit to the United States where he met Congressional leaders and advisers to President Bill Clinton. Last night Mr Spring said: 'Any statement that gives the appearance of wanting to establish peace in Ireland is something that has to be dealt with.' 'But if they are serious about wanting to establish peace . . . I would say to them 'Stop the killings, stop the bombings', and let people know that they are serious.' An Irish government spokesman said yesterday: 'The Taoiseach is keeping an open mind. He is looking forward to hearing what progress has been made (in the Hume-Adams talks) and if they can advance the progress to peace, then there will be a positive reaction to the initiative.' The Dublin government has maintained that it has not yet received any details of the Hume-Adams initiative, although a senior foreign ministry official is reported to have met Mr Hume a few days before the Hume-Adams announcement. The foreign ministry would neither confirm nor deny these reports. 'Our officials have many contacts in Northern Ireland and it is not our policy to make comments on individual meetings,' it said. The UK government is also believed to have been informed of the initiative, when Mr Hume met Mr John Major on September 16. As a result, the hard-line Democratic Unionist party headed by Rev Ian Paisley has angrily ruled out any further participation in the round-table talks process. DUP leaders walked out of an acrimonious meeting in Belfast last Friday with Mr Michael Ancram, minister of state for Northern Ireland, claiming that the government had refused to discuss fresh DUP proposals for a new constitutional assembly in Northern Ireland, which were first presented to Mr Major more than two weeks ago. A Northern Ireland Office spokesman said last Friday's meeting: 'was not a fruitful meeting'. He said that the DUP proposals had been on the agenda, 'but Dr Paisley instead launched an attack on what he claimed was a government dialogue with Sinn Fein'. He said the NIO had not yet decided whether to attempt to reconvene the round-table talks, which have been stalled since last November, without the participation of the DUP, 'but it has not been ruled out either'. It has also emerged that Mr Spring and Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, met in New York last week when the latest developments on Northern Ireland were discussed. Mr Spring had been in New York to address the General Assembly of the United Nations last Friday. In his speech he said: 'The pieces of the jigsaw are all to hand if only we can find the right way to fit them together . . we will bring to any resumed talks the resources of goodwill, flexibility and imagination which we believe all participants must display if a new agree-ment is to be achieved. 'It is painfully obvious that all traditional approaches have failed and that new thinking is urgently required . . . we are ready to accept the need for radical and innovative compromise as part of a new accommodation which will bring lasting peace and reconciliation to the island of Ireland. 'Peace is now the imperative; and the continuation of violence is the single greatest obstacle to the realisation of our hopes. An end to violence would, at least, help to clear the way for compromise and negotiation'. As if to underline that statement, the IRA yesterday exploded bombs in both Belfast and London. Two bombs exploded in Belfast, one at a tyre depot in the docks area, and one at an electrical wholesalers in the north of the city. No one was injured in either blast but both bombs caused extensive damage. Five bombs were set off in north London yesterday morning, causing havoc with rush-hour traffic but apparently causing no injuries and only minor damage. Commander David Tucker, head of the Anti-Terrorist Squad, said that the lack of a usual telephoned warning was a 'sinister change of strategy' by the IRA. The IRA has confirmed that it planted three bombs in north London on Saturday which injured five passers-by.   Countries:-  GBZ   United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P9721 International Affairs.

0,FT934-5663 ,"FT934-5663 _AN-DK2DYACNFT 931129   FT  29 NOV 93 / Leading Article: Talking to the IRA   Anyone who seeks peace in Northern Ireland, at an honourable price, should support Mr John Major today. The prime minister has been charged with duplicity, on the ground that his government has sanctioned secret contacts with the Irish Republican Army in spite of its frequent protestations that it would never negotiate with terrorists. This is a setback for those who believe that governments must at all times behave like boy scouts, but the alternative would have been worse. Public deal-making with Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, could not be countenanced by a democratically elected British administration unless the bombers of Warrington and the Shankill Road turned convincingly away from violence. Yet a refusal to keep open unofficial lines of communication would have denied the government the chance to make its own position plain, and to take note of any peace proposals coming from the other side. The Israelis spent some time in secret conclave with the Palestine Liberation Organisation before emerging in public with their recent deal. Mr Major has not gone nearly as far as that, nor could he even if he wanted to: unlike Israel, he is not in the business of trading territory for peace. Constitutional future British policy is clear. If the IRA lays down its arms, and an unspecified period of 'quarantine' has passed, Sinn Fein can join talks about the constitutional future of Northern Ireland. Relations with the republic of Ireland will be discussed with Dublin. Any proposals arising from such talks would have to be endorsed by the voters of Northern Ireland. The unionists would therefore retain their veto on any plan to move towards a united Ireland - a point Mr Major again needs to make plain today. Republicans would have to persuade them to change their minds. The IRA is thus invited to abandon its campaign of violence and to rely on Sinn Fein's re-entry to the political process. It can show whether its talk of peace has any substance by picking up that invitation today. Mr Major, who has placed himself at the head of a drive to seek a political settlement of the troubles, has behaved with courage, and a sense of responsibility. Certainly, as an FT report shows today, his peace initiative is in tune with business opinion in Ulster. It also reflects the feelings of most ordinary people. The prime minister aims to take advantage of a tide of popular feeling in favour of peace, while not abandoning the unionists and their right of veto. He is therefore standing by his Northern Ireland secretary, Sir Patrick Mayhew, who has no reason to resign. The latter has said that the documents relating to back-door communications with the IRA will be published today. It must be presumed these will confirm that the long-standing and oft-repeated government promise to the Unionists, that the people of Northern Ireland will be able to determine their own future, will be seen to have been respected. Limit the damage Northern Ireland being what it is, this will not satisfy everyone. The cries of 'betrayal' from the Reverend Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionists are routine; the more measured response from Mr Molyneaux's larger unionist party suggests that it may be possible to limit the damage to the prime minister's peace initiative. It is often remarked that the government depends on unionist votes to shore up its uncertain parliamentary majority, but, against that, the unionists depend on the continuance in office of the Conservatives. To Ulster ears, Labour sounds pro-republican. A greater danger lies on the right wing of Mr Major's own party, where pro-unionist speeches have recently been made by Lord Tebbit and the former chancellor, Mr Norman Lamont. Initial reactions to the weekend's news, notably from Mr Lamont, suggest that the damage may be containable. With luck, and skill in handling the house of commons, Mr Major and Sir Patrick should be able to weather today's political storm. Assuming that they do, there should be no hesitation in pressing on with the peace initiative. The next step for the prime minister will be to confirm the date for his planned summit meeting with Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister. Friday would not be too soon.

The crisis throws fresh doubt over the future pace of the Northern Ireland peace process. As Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, was outlining proposals to bring Ulster's loyalist groups into the talks process in a speech at the Lord Mayor's banquet, Mr Albert Reynolds, his Irish counterpart, was preparing for a parliamentary showdown today with his Labour party partners. The crisis, triggered by Labour's opposition to Mr Reynolds' proposed appointment of Mr Harry Whelehan, the attorney-general, as president of the High Court, looks certain to end the 22-month coalition. Mr Reynolds was in consultation with his Fianna Fail ministers yesterday. If the crisis is unresolved and Mr Reynolds loses a vote of no confidence he could seek the permission of Mrs Mary Robinson, the Irish president, to dissolve parliament, and call early elections. Alternatively, and some political observers believed this more likely yesterday, Mrs Robinson could ask the opposition parties to form a government with Labour. Mrs Robinson is understood to have taken legal advice yesterday. The prospective collapse of the Dublin government threatens to halt progress on the joint framework document being negotiated by the UK and Irish governments for a durable political settlement in Northern Ireland. But in a remark hinting at the possible break-up of the coalition, Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister and Labour leader, said: 'The momentum towards peace this opportunity offers as a prospect is beyond attack by any form of government or political party.' After a meeting with Mr Spring in Dublin yesterday, Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, indicated that progress had been made, although he refused to be drawn on a date for completion of the framework document. The UK government aims to start exploratory talks with loyalist political representatives before the end of the year, Mr Major announced yesterday. Speaking in London, he confirmed that the government was ready to begin talks with Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, by the end of the year. His remarks were welcomed across the political divide in Ulster. Mr Seamus Mallon, deputy leader of the moderate nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party, said: 'These talks should happen as quickly as possible so that the preliminary elements can be dealt with.' However, Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, described Mr Major's speech as 'wholly inadequate' and attacked him for 'still talking about talks'.

Mr Michael Ancram, the Northern Ireland minister responsible for conducting talks with the province's main parties, is to resume immediately the series of bilateral discussions aimed at seeking agreement on the shape of a political settlement in the province. In Dublin Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, is expected to announce today the opening of formal talks with Irish opposition leaders on the setting up of the proposed Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, first mentioned in the Downing Street declaration as a way of promoting cross-border relationships. The message from both governments will be that Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, will be able to participate in both exercises only when the republican movement decides on a permanent cessation of violence. Since the end of the IRA ceasefire on Friday, the province has again been hit by terrorist attacks from the IRA as well as from loyalist groups. In spite of Ulster politicians' intense public criticism of the so-called three-stranded talks process and the prospect of slow progress at least until after the European elections in June, the Northern Ireland Office intends to press on with the internal dialogue and with efforts to agree with Dublin a more detailed framework for political progress. Until now Mr Reynolds has resisted opposition calls to establish the forum, preferring to wait for a response from Sinn Fein to the Downing Street declaration. In December Mr Reynolds said the purpose of the forum would be to bring Sinn Fein into an initial negotiating process with nationalist parties following a permanent cessation of IRA violence. Dublin's thinking now is to leave an empty seat for Sinn Fein pending an end to IRA violence. Mr John Bruton, the leader of Ireland's opposition Fine Gael party, said yesterday that the peace process now required 'more practical and more immediate' measures including talks between Northern Ireland's political parties on a Bill of Rights for the province. Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, yesterday started a week-long visit to the US to explain the government's policy on Ulster.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Mr Molyneaux's warning followed a meeting with Mr John Major, the prime minister, at which he confirmed that the UUP was willing to keep the door open to a further round of talks. However, it further complicates the peace process, which has shown signs of stalling in recent days because of growing tension between London and Dublin on the ceasefire issue. The Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the hardline Democratic Unionist party, also tried to block the talks yesterday by declaring he would 'never' negotiate with Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA. After a separate meeting with Mr Major, he said he had told the prime minister not to waste his time listening to 'the blarney and the lying from Dublin'. He said Mr Major had told him that if the Anglo-Irish initiative failed, the government would reconsider DUP proposals for an internal settlement based on power-sharing devolution. Mr Paisley's continued hostility to the Anglo-Irish initiative is a disappointment to the government, which had hoped that public pressure for peace would moderate the DUP approach. However, Mr Molyneaux's growing suspicion of Dublin's motives is potentially a far more serious blow to the peace process because of the UUP's much greater support among Ulster protestants. Mr Reynolds appeared to be 'drifting away' from the terms of his joint statement with Mr Major in Brussels two weeks ago. 'The position which has been put forward by Mr Reynolds is causing such unease that it may in fact block sensible progress within Northern Ireland,' he said. The Irish prime minister's focus on an early cessation of violence had caused 'a great deal of unease, confusion and instability in Northern Ireland'. Mr Reynolds was 'at least contemplating some kind of link up with the Hume-Adams talks, which can only mean an unacceptable series of concessions to terrorists'. A survey in today's Guardian shows that 59 per cent of 1,400 people polled in mainland Britain believe the IRA or Sinn Fein should be allowed to take part in peace talks. Some 44 per cent thought their participation should be conditional on ending the campaign of violence, while 15 per cent believed they should automatically be involved.

Mr John Major and Mr Albert Reynolds agreed during talks in Brussels to speed up work towards a framework agreement to persuade Ulster's constitutional parties to return to the negotiating table. They rejected as a basis for peace the conclusions of recent talks between Mr John Hume of the SDLP and Mr Gerry Adams of Sinn Fein. There could be 'no question' of the two governments adopting or endorsing Mr Hume's report of the dialogue. That report was passed yesterday for the first time to Mr Major by Mr Reynolds. A joint communique, however, released by the British and Irish prime ministers after their meeting, left open the possibility of Sinn Fein being brought into the peace process if and when 'a renunciation of violence had been made and sufficiently demonstrated'. In those circumstances 'new doors could open'. At the end of a week of the worst sectarian violence for two decades, the two leaders condemned the tit-for-tat killings by terrorists from the Catholic and Protestant communities. Their communique attacked the 'murderous and premeditated acts which could serve no end other than to deepen the bloodshed in Northern Ireland'. Mr Major and Mr Reynolds reaffirmed their determination to restart the stalled negotiating process designed to bring a permanent political settlement to the province. Their cautiously upbeat tone followed the Dublin government's acknowledgement earlier this week of the right of the Unionist community to exercise a permanent veto on changes in Ulster's constitutional status. Both sides confirmed that the essence of any agreement would be a move by the Republic to replace its constitutional claim to the province with the aspiration of a united Ireland. Britain in return would offer a significant extension of cross-border administration. But the communique glossed over significant differences on the extent to which elements of the Hume-Adams peace initiative could be incorporated into their own negotiations. Mr Reynolds told Mr Major that the two sides could not ignore the potential for a cessation of violence by the IRA in return for a place at the negotiating table for Sinn Fein. But, speaking after their talks, Mr Major told journalists that there could be 'no talks or negotiations between democratic governments and those who use, threaten or support violence'. Nor could there be any secret agreements or understandings with Sinn Fein or the IRA. Despite their new determination to fill the political vacuum in which the terrorists have flourished, the two leaders also acknowledged that an intergovernmental agreement would not be enough in itself to bring peace.

It is the first such incident since the IRA ceasefire three months ago. An explosive device containing 2lb of Semtex explosive was discovered in a furniture store in Enniskillen. The IRA, in a short statement yesterday, denied responsibility for planting it. The possibility that the Irish government would reverse its decision to place a block on the pre-Christmas early release of IRA prisoners was last night thought to depend on whether the IRA denial was accepted by Dublin. The new justice minister, Ms Nora Owen, said she hoped to make a statement in the next few days. The find overshadowed yesterday's second session of exploratory talks between British officials and Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing. It will underscore British demands to see the issue of the decommissioning of arms and explosives resolved before Sinn Fein is invited to engage in full political talks with the government and other constitutional parties. The issue is likely to be high on the agenda at today's meeting between Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, and Mr John Bruton, the new prime minister of the Irish Republic. The find is the first evidence of the use of Semtex since the IRA ceasefire at the beginning of September. The IRA is the only paramilitary organisation believed to possess such material. Mr Martin McGuinness, who led the five-strong Sinn Fein delegation at yesterday's talks, refused to condemn the action. He said: 'It was an incident of no great significance, and it certainly won't affect the peace process.' He suggested the incident might have been part of a 'dirty tricks operation' designed to implicate republicans in violence. Mr Michael Ancram, Northern Ireland political affairs minister, expressed disappointment that Sinn Fein, as a democratic party, had declined to condemn the action. He said Sinn Fein had requested a further meeting in January. Mr Ken Maginnis, the Ulster Unionist MP, described the attempted bombing as 'a carefully orchestrated IRA operation to intimidate the British government into agreeing unjustified concessions'. Mr Bruton, speaking in Dublin before leaving for today's talks in London, said he was 'saddened' by the incident, but he stressed there were 'certain unusual aspects of the incident, which made it unclear who was involved'.

After the first Anglo-Irish conference since December's Downing Street Declaration, he said there was 'a rational ground for being hopeful' that there would be a positive response by Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing. The British and Irish governments have agreed to give Sinn Fein more time to consider their joint peace initiative. In the meantime, however, they will press ahead 'as a matter of urgency' with efforts to restart round-table talks between the province's constitutional parties. Hours after Sir Patrick's remarks, Sinn Fein president Mr Gerry Adams said he was prepared to go 'the extra mile' for peace. 'I am willing to seek to persuade the IRA to make a definitive decision on the conduct of its campaign,' he said in Belfast. Earlier yesterday the US government in effect refused Mr Adams a visa to attend a conference on Northern Ireland in New York on Monday, saying it would only consider lifting its ban on him entering the country if he renounced violence and embraced the peace process. Sir Patrick also hinted at greater flexibility on the British government's refusal to respond to demands by Sinn Fein for clarification of the declaration. He said that 'through speeches' both governments would continue to 'make clear' what the joint declaration offered. 'If there are misapprehensions I will put that right . . . you can call it clarification if you like.' He added that he did not dis-agree with any recent speeches on the declaration made by the Irish prime minister, Mr Albert Reynolds, or the foreign minister, Mr Dick Spring. These had been expressly aimed at clarifying concerns raised by Sinn Fein. Sir Patrick reiterated, however, that there would be no negotiation or 'unravelling' of the agreement. The declaration concedes the principle of national self-determination for the Irish people as a whole, but any new agreement would require majority consent in Northern Ireland. Sir Patrick's positive tone contrasted with the mood at recent private briefings for journalists by the Northern Ireland office, and suggests yesterday's talks have given him reasons for optimism. Mr Spring, asked if he was privy to information that Sinn Fein was moving towards an acceptance of the declaration, said: 'I don't think it would be helpful to go into details.'

He sent a letter to Mr John Major setting out his agenda for talks between the British government and Sinn Fein, David Owen and John Murray Brown write. He said he had written to the prime minister to ensure there was 'no confusion or time lost over arranging such matters as delegations, venues and times'. He added: 'All of these issues can and should be sorted out now.' Downing Street yesterday confirmed that Mr Major had received the letter but officials were not sure whether he had had time to study it. They said the government would move ahead with talks 'at the pace it determined to be correct'. Ministers have said a preliminary dialogue with Sinn Fein would begin before Christmas if the IRA ceasefire, now nearly three months old, held. Talks with loyalist political representatives would start soon afterwards. Mr Adams told Downing Street that the Sinn Fein team in the talks would be led by Mr Martin McGuinness, a vice-president. He said that the ground to be covered should include 'demilitarisation and other issues'. A week ago Mr Adams accused the government of dragging its feet on efforts to forge a lasting settlement in the province. Yesterday Mr Pat Doherty, another Sinn Fein vice-president, speaking at Dublin's Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, called on both London and Dublin to convene all-party talks to find a settlement. Fine Gael, the Irish republic's main opposition party, said explosives and guns had to be decommissioned before full political talks involving Sinn Fein could start.

0,FT943-3207 ,"FT943-3207 _AN-EIOC7AC6FT 940915   FT  15 SEP 94 / Survey of Northern Ireland (1): The challenge now is winning the peace - With the prospect of a lasting peace now firmly on the agenda, serious thoughts are being given to the economic implications      By TIM COONE   Sir John Davies, the attorney general for Ireland under the first Queen Elizabeth, described Ulster in 1606 as 'the most rude and unreformed part of Ireland, and the seat and nest of the last great rebellion.' Catholic Irish lords had constantly 'champed at the bit' of British rule, but it was 315 years after the attorney general wrote those words before the problem of seemingly perpetual Irish revolt was partially resolved by partitioning the island in 1921. A better-known former UK attorney general, and currently the Northern Ireland secretary of state, Sir Patrick Mayhew, has had the delicate task of presiding over the ending of another rebellion, that of the Provisional IRA, which for the past 25 years has created havoc in Ulster and on the British mainland in its efforts to force a total British withdrawal from the province. The IRA's cessation of hostilities, announced two weeks ago, has so far held, and a growing number of political leaders both domestically and abroad are coming to believe that this may really be the permanent cessation of violence demanded by the two governments in last December's Downing Street declaration, and which will pave the way for the inclusion of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, into round-table talks. Sir Patrick stresses that it is the 'intention' that the ceasefire be permanent which is important and that this must be matched by deeds and words before the British government can finally accept the IRA's bona fides  -'the reason is that this government cannot be seen to sit and down and talk to people who may be reserving an option of going back to their former violence if they don't get what they want at the table . . . I have to maintain the confidence of people in Northern Ireland.' That confidence is showing signs of growing. In Dublin, the Irish prime minister met Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president last week, to prepare the ground for Sinn Fein's inclusion in a Dublin-based Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, which will bring together the political parties in the Republic with Sinn Fein, the nationalist Social Democratic Labour Party (SDLP) and the moderate Alliance party from Northern Ireland. The North's other unionist parties have so far refused to join the Forum, but some leaders of the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) have indicated that they believe the ceasefire to be permanent and, once convinced of that, have said that they will eventually sit at the table with Sinn Fein. At the international level, the US government has thrown its weight behind the peace process and held out a promise of economic assistance to Northern Ireland, as has the European Commission. Whether the Loyalist paramilitaries will also lay down their weapons - a key factor in the peace equation - remains to be resolved, and a small bomb planted at a Dublin railway station last Monday does not look encouraging. But community workers in Protestant working class areas of Belfast are convinced that a Loyalist ceasefire will be declared within the next few weeks. If so, the momentum towards peace would become increasingly unstoppable. The next hurdle in the peace process, once a ceasefire is established on both sides of the community, will be to convince all the political parties to sit down and negotiate new constitutional arrangements for Northern Ireland. A focus for these talks is being drafted by the British and Irish governments in the form of a 'framework document,' which will address such issues as reform of the Republic's territorial claim to Northern Ireland; a new elected assembly for the province; and cross-border administrative structures which will encourage greater economic and political co-operation between the Republic and Northern Ireland. No-one is under the illusion that these talks will be anything other than difficult. The UUP and the hard-line Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) see in the cross-border structures a potential trap which will lead to eventual joint sovereignty, and a back-door approach to a united Ireland. Mr Jim Gibney, who sits on the national executive of Sinn Fein, said his party would welcome new cross-party structures - 'if they are free-standing and can freely develop and there is no ceiling built into their development, we would see them as a process towards national reconciliation.' Unionist fears can, it is hoped, be dealt with, by having the executive powers of the new bodies jointly delegated to them by parliaments in both the Republic and Northern Ireland, rather than by the two governments, according to Sir Patrick. Whether nationalists will accept this, remains to be seen. Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, said last week that the next battle to come 'will be over the framework document.' But both governments are convinced that with a willingness to compromise by both nationalists and unionists, facilitated by a climate of peace, then agreement is achievable. Sir Patrick says 'there has got to be an outcome in which nobody can seek to have achieved everything at the end.' So, with the prospect of a lasting peace now firmly on the agenda, if not yet firmly in place, serious thoughts are now being given to the economic implications of peace. Economists are divided on the issue. There are those who say that Northern Ireland's development agencies such as the Industrial Development Board and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board, will be able to aggressively market the province to foreign investors, no longer having to fight against the negative image created by the troubles. The announcement last week by Hilton International, that it is to build a 187-bedroom hotel as a centrepiece to the new Laganside development in Belfast will be an encouragement to others thinking of capitalising on what is expected to be a tourist boom in the province in the years ahead. Seagate, the US electronics manufacturer, last year established a high-tech manufacturing facility in Londonderry, without waiting for a peace settlement, attracted by the large pool of skilled labour in the province. The textile industry continues to grow and now provides around a quarter of all manufacturing employment. First-class infrastructure in road, rail, telecoms, ports and airports adds to the attraction of the province. The optimists therefore say that peace will bring foreign investment on a similar scale to that achieved by Scotland, Wales and the Irish Republic. Whilst the economic benefit of peace is not in dispute, more cautious analysts point to the downside. As many as 20,000 people are estimated to be employed in the security forces and related occupations such as the security guards seen at the entrance of almost every large store and office block across the province. Many of these could be expected to lose their jobs. The short-term effect could be a rise in the unemployment level of 98,000 or 13.1 per cent of the workforce, already the highest in the UK. Sir Patrick acknowledges the problem - 'there is going to be a need for gradual adjustments and it is true that a lot of jobs are linked to the emergency.' He says that up to 80 per cent of the annual Pounds 1bn government spending on security is related to the emergency. The potential loss to the economy in security-related spending by both the public and private sectors could therefore exceed Pounds 1bn in the event of a lasting peace, equivalent to around 10 per cent of the province's GDP. Business leaders can thus be expected to exert intense pressure upon both governments to provide extra resources for Northern Ireland, whether from their own exchequers, or by enlisting support from Washington and Brussels. As Michael Smyth, an economist at the University of Ulster, says: 'The danger is that the government could pull the rug out from under the private sector, just as they have a chance of taking off.' After decades, indeed centuries, of conflict and rebellion in Northern Ireland, the real challenge thus facing Ulster's politicians as the 21st century approaches is no longer that of winning the war, but rather winning the peace.

Considerable differences remain over its phrasing, which will be discussed in subsequent summits scheduled for later in the month. Agreement is by no means assured. But the Irish government can derive some satisfaction in having convinced Mr John Major to tackle the peace process before moving on to British concerns over constitutional issues, in particular the Irish republic's territorial claim to Northern Ireland. The Irish proposal, contained in a document tabled last July, has been back and forth between the two governments since, and disagreement over its focus on the issue of Irish self-determination has been the principal stumbling block to progress on the peace initiative. Self-determination is viewed as a loaded term by the British and by Northern Ireland's unionists, who see it as implying a veto by the republic over constitutional changes in the north. The Irish insist that this is not so. Mr Noel Dempsey, the Irish government chief whip, said: 'There seems to be some confusion in the British government's mind as to what we mean by self-determination.' He added: 'What we are talking about is separate referenda, north and south, where both peoples in both parts of the island can make their views known. If consent is freely given, if a majority in both parts of the island decide that they want a united Ireland, of whatever form, then we will abide by that. We are not talking about collective self-determination.' In Belfast, Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, last night said that hopes for an immediate unilateral ceasefire by the IRA was 'unrealistic'. Mr Richard Macaulay, Sinn Fein official spokesman, said: 'It is unrealistic to expect that the IRA will unilaterally end their actions without political progress.' Mr Jim Rodgers, deputy leader of the official Unionist Party on Belfast City Council, warned that loyalist paramilitaries were preparing a backlash if the London-Dublin peace process led to big concessions to the nationalist community. While the talks were taking place the army discovered a 1,000lb IRA bomb intended for an army patrol. The device was planted on the outskirts of Belfast near a primary school. The nationalist goal of a united Ireland does not seem to be as crucial to Catholics in Northern Ireland as many have believed. An opinion poll in yesterday's Irish Times indicated that only 32 per cent of Catholics in Ulster favour a united Ireland, although 65 per cent favour a constitutional change involving a greater role for Dublin.

0,FT934-2173 ,"FT934-2173 _AN-DLOCPAECFT 931215   FT  15 DEC 93 / Leading Article: Jaw-jaw in Ulster   The meeting between the British and Irish prime ministers planned for today should result in an agreed statement on the way forward to a peace deal for Ulster. It is always a mistake to be unduly optimistic about Northern Ireland, as the latest IRA 1,000lb bomb, discovered and defused in Belfast yesterday, indicates. Yet there is evidence of a strong desire for peace in both the north and south of Ireland. More to the point, the possible outlines of an eventual peace agreement that should command support from all but the most recalcitrant extremists can now be discerned. One element might be some form of devolved assembly for the governance of the province. Its exact composition and functions would have to be negotiated with the legitimate political parties of Ulster. Once the IRA has convincingly turned away from violence Sinn Fein will doubtless be invited to join those negotiations. Mechanisms for co-operation between Dublin and Belfast might be included in the eventual package. Such constitutional details are of secondary importance to the Anglo-Irish declaration of intent on which Mr John Major and Mr Albert Reynolds spent so much telephone time yesterday. In this delicate area every word is potentially lethal. Both prime ministers propose a guarantee that the constitutional status of Ulster will not be changed without the consent of its people, but agreement on everything else has been difficult. Referendum The IRA, which should not be permitted to call the tune, might, it appears, accept a northern veto on Irish unity, but only if the proposition is first approved by a referendum of all the people of the island of Ireland, north and south. That is unacceptable to many unionists. Mr Reynolds has offered to relinquish the articles in the republic's constitution that claim the territory of Northern Ireland, in return for a British statement recognising as legitimate, and promoting, the aspiration for Irish unity. Mr Major has had to consider the possibility of setting off a new outburst of violence by loyalist paramilitaries if he appears to lean too strongly in the republican direction. In marches and opinion polls the people of Ireland and Ulster have expressed their desire for the talks between the two prime ministers to succeed. Business leaders concur, as the FT's survey of senior business opinion in the province indicates. The poll, taken on Thursday and Friday of last week, reflects the views of chief executives of leading firms. Of 80 companies approached, 56 responded. This suggests an unprecedented willingness to express a business view of the politics of Northern Ireland. It is a measure of the economic damage that the troubles have done. Opportunities Perhaps it is not so surprising that 90 per cent of those who replied to the FT questionnaire said that an agreed political settlement that achieved an end to the violence would have a 'very' or 'fairly' positive effect on business and economic opportunities. The chief executives were, however, evenly split on the prospects. Most of them do not believe that terrorism can be defeated by military means. Some 70 per cent believe it impossible to defeat the IRA; the corresponding figure for the loyalist paramilitaries is 64 per cent. In the nature of things in the province business leaders are more likely to be Protestants than Catholics. It is striking that 61 per cent of them accept the notion of separate referenda in both parts of the island, albeit on the assumption that the purpose would be to affirm a deal guaranteeing a majority veto in Northern Ireland and leading to an end to the Republic's constitutional claim to the north. There is also a remarkable degree of support for negotiation with Sinn Fein  -36 per cent at once, or as soon as the IRA announces that it will abandon violence, and 59 per cent after the IRA has kept to a peaceful path for a period of time. Just over half the respondents favoured stronger devolved power structures in the province, and a third thought business would prosper if there were north-south links. This survey reflects moderate opinion. Today's statement of intent should challenge terrorists on both sides to lay down their arms.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.     IEZ  Ireland, EC.

But Mr John Major and Mr Albert Reynolds insisted after a 90-minute meeting at Downing Street that they would press ahead with efforts to forge a durable political settlement in the province in advance of the next full Anglo-Irish summit in July. The two prime ministers said good progress had been made on a framework document 'grounded in' last December's Downing Street Declaration designed to instil new momentum into political talks involving Ulster's main constitutional parties. But they would give no guarantee that the framework document would be completed in time for the planned summit. Yesterday's wide-ranging but informal talks came after Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, pledged to give a 'definitive' response on the question of what part the UK-Irish declaration would play in the overall peace process. Mr Adams also signalled that republicans were now satisfied with the clarification London had given of the joint statement's meaning. He said: 'We are committed to building the peace process regardless of how significant a part that declaration plays. We may have some other questions. But I doubt it.' In remarks interpreted by some as an attempt to win support for Sinn Fein candidates in next months European elections, Mr Adams said he was 'quite convinced' that a settlement was going to come out of the peace process. He said Sinn Fein would meet after polling day on June 9 to 'work out a timetable and discuss it with our leaderships'. Mr Ken Maginnis, Ulster Unionist party security spokesman, said Mr Adams was preparing to announce a 'cynical and very temporary ceasefire' to maximise the Sinn Fein vote in the European elections. Emerging from a 'very useful' meeting at which matters of mutual interest were discussed, Mr Reynolds counselled patience, saying if the 'internal debate' among the republican movement took 'another few weeks, so be it' - as long as the violence ended at once. In carefully balanced remarks, he emphasised that neither republican or loyalist paramilitaries would gain anything by continuing their armed campaigns. He added: 'We are waiting for a decision by both organisations to desist from violence.' Mr Major praised the 'dramatic' improvement in cross-border security co-operation. He said few people would have imagined how much progress had been made in addressing the province's problems over the past 12 months.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.     IEZ  Ireland, EC.

Mr Reynolds, due to meet John Major when both attend the  February 19 England-Ireland rugby fixture at Twickenham, said  the talks would involve Ulster Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew and  Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring.    ""The meeting will be a question of monitoring the situation  relating to the Downing Street peace declaration, updating  ourselves as to where it's at and having a general review of the  progress of the declaration,"" he told the Dublin parliament.    Mr Reynolds, who on Monday [7 February] night received  British proposals for resuming inter-party negotiations on  Northern Ireland's future, said ministers from the two  governments would consider how they could proceed to the next  stage of the talks that stalled well over a year ago.    He insisted there was no ""conflict or competition"" between  last year's December 15 peace statement and the British attempt  to restart the talks.    ""I do not see the peace declaration standing in the way of  talks. I believe it gives the talks process a greater chance of  success. There is now a new starting point because of the  declaration.""    Mr Spring said today the proposals received from Britain  contained ""a checklist of relevant points in relation to the  recommencement of the talks process.""    Mr Reynolds rejected calls in the Dail to publish details of  his correspondence with Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams.    He refused to depart from ""a long-established tradition of  confidentiality"" regarding communications involving the head of  government.    The premier said he sent a detailed letter to Mr Adams,  backed up by a memorandum, in reply to a request for  clarification of the Downing Street declaration.    ""I have provided as much explanation and clarification as  possible.""    Mr Reynolds said he looked forward to an early response from  the IRA and its Sinn Fein political spokesmen to the peace  initiative.    While no deadline had been set, a lot of attention would  naturally focus on Sinn Fein's annual conference in Dublin at  the end of the month, he added.    He brushed aside opposition criticism of Dublin's attitude  towards the granting by the US of a visa permitting Mr Adams to  speak in America last week.    ""The American administration took the decision and that was  that. We don't get involved in trying to tell foreign  administrations what kind of decisions to take.""    Sinn Fein today put the blame for their slow response to the  declaration on the [British] Government.    Party chairman Tom Hartley condemned London's ""continued  stubborn refusal"" to clarify the declaration.    He said that in contrast to Britain's inflexibility, the  Dublin government acted responsibly in the matter and its  efforts were welcome and helpful.    ""If John Major is serious about constructing a real peace  process he should follow the lead given by Albert Reynolds,  rather than pursuing the tried and failed policy of partition.""    Mr Hartley said long-overdue clarification would allow every  one to make a judgment of the London-Dublin plan. ""Britain's  refusal to do so is unnecessarily delaying our process of  consultation and consideration.""    Sir Patrick tonight emphasised the Government's  determination  to defeat terrorism.    ""We shall continue to provide the security forces with the  resources they need to bring those guilty of terrorist crime to  account through the due process of law,"" he said during a visit  to police and Army bases in north Belfast.

Sir Patrick's note of caution came as Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, attacked London for 'consistently trying to reduce the momentum of the peace process'. Meanwhile, Mr Mitchel McLoughlin, another senior Sinn Fein figure, warned that the process could break down if London insisted on paramilitary groups surrendering their weapons before agreement on political structures was in sight. These latest indications of the difficulty of the path ahead came on the eve of Sinn Fein's first meeting with the Republic's main political parties in the Dublin-based Forum for Peace and Reconciliation. Speaking in Dublin, Mr Adams dismissed the government's Irish policy as 'crisis management' and accused it of trying to avoid the political and constitutional change that was 'fundamental to a lasting peace settlement'. Sir Patrick told the first House of Commons debate on the province since the IRA and loyalist ceasefires that he greatly hoped London and Dublin would reach agreement but 'it is not certain'. His tone was less upbeat than that of Mr John Major, the prime minister, who met Mr Albert Reynolds, his Irish counterpart, at Chequers on Monday. Mr Major said after the talks that both were 'confident of being able to reach agreement'. Sir Patrick reaffirmed the government's readiness to hold preliminary talks with republican leaders by the end of the year if London could continue 'reasonably' to assume Sinn Fein was 'establishing a commitment to exclusively peaceful methods'. They would 'embrace the Republicans' proposals for depositing and de-commissioning their armaments', he said. Sir Patrick sought to reassure Unionists by saying there were no circumstances in which security would be reduced to a level below that needed to counter the threat of 'terrorist crime'. He hinted that the army would not pull out of the province entirely. Meanwhile, Dublin yesterday sought to play down the significance of a disclosure in yesterday's Financial Times that it had suggested draft amendments to article 2 of its constitution, defining Ulster as part of the republic's 'national territory'. Dublin said the reports were 'two or three months out of date'. The issue of article 2 was not raised at Chequers, an Irish spokesman said. 'At no stage has the British government asked the Irish government to define the nation in any way that would have left the Unionists out of the Irish nation.'

0,FT934-1366 ,"FT934-1366 _AN-DLTC1AAIFT 931220   FT  20 DEC 93 / Reynolds warns IRA of crackdown: Irish PM will help UK over security if peace moves fail      By JAMES BLITZ and TIM COONE      LONDON, DUBLIN   Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, yesterday warned he would help Britain impose a tough security clamp-down against the IRA if it did not respond positively to the two governments' bid to bring peace to Northern Ireland. As Mr Reynolds sought to put further pressure on the IRA to give up its 25-year armed struggle against Britain's presence in Ulster, Mr John Major, the British prime minister, appealed to Ulster unionists to recognise the initiative as the last chance for peace. Mr Reynolds warned on BBC radio that both governments 'would be expected to respond' if loyalists and nationalists resumed the path of violence: 'After a period in which such strong support has been expressed by the people in both communities for peace, I think there would be revulsion over a resumption of full-scale violence,' he said. Mr Reynolds ruled out a return to internment for terrorist suspects, which he said was 'the strongest recruiting platform that the IRA were handed'. It seems increasingly unlikely that Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, will deliver an early response to the two governments' declaration last Wednesday. An indication of Sinn Fein's position came from Mr John Hume, leader of the Social Democratic and Labour Party, speaking after talks yesterday with Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president. Mr Hume said he believed Mr Adams was 'very serious' about peace in the region. In the Sunday Tribune newspaper in Dublin, Mr Adams said: 'Republicans will be considering (the joint declaration) in the context of Sinn Fein's peace strategy. We will approach it positively and seek to move the peace strategy forward.' The Republican movement, he said, would consider the declaration 'over Christmas and for some time after that . . . There are no quick fixes in this situation'. However, a bomb explosion in Londonderry yesterday showed the IRA was not committed to an unofficial ceasefire while deciding what action to take. Three children and two adults narrowly escaped being killed in the blast, which was the first attack since Wednesday's Downing Street declaration. Mr Reynolds tempered his warning about a security clampdown with hints of benefits to the IRA if it sued for peace. He also suggested London might negotiate over 'the future of prisoners' held in British jails: 'I think that's what the British government would have in mind in exploratory talks with Sinn Fein which they said would be within three months.' Downing Street officials said that the subject of prisoners was not among initial proposals for talks with Sinn Fein in the aftermath of a ceasefire. A Downing Street spokeswoman emphasised that British jails contained 'criminals' not 'political prisoners'. Unionist politicians also warned that they would oppose any amnesty for IRA prisoners as part of an overall deal. Mr Major's appeal to Northern Ireland's Unionists to accept the peace initiative, in an article for the Belfast newspaper, Sunday Life, said the joint initiative did not undermine the union between Britain and Northern Ireland. Mr Major said: 'I support the union. I have always supported the union. That is my personal right.' However he went on: 'But I shall not seek to impose my view on the greater number of people of Northern Ireland if they decide otherwise.'

The outcome of talks between Mr Peter Brooke, Northern Ireland secretary, and the party leaders in Belfast undermined hopes that anything other than a symbolic first meeting could start before the election. Mr Brooke expressed optimism that talks could start 'as soon as possible'. However, in spite of the optimism created by the unexpected deal between Unionist and nationalist leaders late last week on resuming talks, it appears significant details have still to be worked out. Mr Brooke will meet Irish ministers on Friday when he will set out the Northern Ireland parties' positions and test whether any fresh conditions they may have proposed for talks are acceptable to the Dublin government. The local leaders also want written assurances from Mr John Major and Mr Neil Kinnock, Labour leader, that talks will continue on the same basis whatever the general election result. A starting date of next Monday for talks seems improbable. The talks, which collapsed in July, are unlikely to restart in earnest until after the election, which is expected to be called by the end of next week. Meanwhile, Northern Ireland clergymen who met Loyalist paramilitary leaders last month said they would be prepared to meet representatives of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, in the interests of peace. Separately, Cardinal Cahal Daly, the Roman Catholic Primate of All Ireland, said on BBC Radio that he would not be surprised if individual priests were meeting the IRA 'because of the tremendous desire for peace there is in all sections of the community.' However, he stressed that the church would not act as political intermediaries.  The Financial Times   London Page 24  "

In a speech clearly aimed at Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, and Northern Ireland's unionists, he told an audience at Trinity College in Dublin yesterday evening, that there will be no 'short cuts' to an agreement for new constitutional arrangements in Northern Ireland and that there will be no backtracking on the Downing Street declaration. In what appeared to be an indirect response to Sinn Fein's concerns, expressed at its annual conference last weekend, that the declaration gives unionists a means to block the pathway to any political progress, Sir Patrick said: 'No one will be allowed to erect impassable procedural barriers to progress. The path of peaceful persuasion is open to all, on the basis of their democratic mandates. 'But those who choose to stay in their cul-de-sacs can have no veto over progress.' The Sinn Fein leader, Mr Martin McGuinness, told the FT last weekend, that if the British government were to clarify that unionists do not have such a veto, then this could break the current stalemate and lead to an IRA ceasefire. Sir Patrick emphasised that any change to Northern Ireland's constitutional status, can only come about with the consent of the majority living there, and not as a result of the majority wish in the island of Ireland as a whole. He said that an 'overwhelming majority' of people on the island supported this view, as evidenced by recent opinion polls. But there remained no predetermined outcome to any future talks and nothing would be ruled in or out. 'If Northern Ireland is to cease to be part of the UK (or) if there is to be a united Ireland, then that is a question which can only be determined by all the people living in Ireland, North and South,' he said. Agreement and consent of a majority in Northern Ireland would be necessary for any change, as stated in the joint declaration, Sir Patrick added. 'It is self-determination, in other words democracy, that shall prevail . . . no one should claim a veto to override that,' he said.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

This emerged yesterday as the government looked poised to send a letter to Sinn Fein indicating its readiness to begin preliminary talks with the IRA's political wing before Christmas. These are now thought likely to start either on December 12 or December 16. Sir John Wheeler, Northern Ireland security minister, said he had no doubt exploratory talks would begin 'within a few days'. The government has also promised to start preliminary dialogue with loyalist representatives by the end of the year. It is understood that the government contacted republican leaders immediately after the Newry murder to demand in the strongest terms an explanation for what happened. The demand brought an admission from the republicans that they did not know what had prompted the raid and that they were trying to find out. The government then sent a second message demanding firm answers. The exchange underlines how close the killing - the first since the IRA and loyalist paramilitaries declared ceasefires - came to derailing the peace process. Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, initially accused the Royal Ulster Constabulary of trying to damage the process by blaming republicans for the shooting. But the IRA later acknowledged its members were responsible. Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, said on the day of the killing on November 10 he was 'deeply angered' by the 'callous and wicked' murder. The next day he stressed the peace process was 'on course'. It is believed the secret contacts may have been initiated by Downing Street but were probably carried out by MI5. A Downing Street official said yesterday he had seen 'no evidence' such contacts had taken place. Yesterday's developments came as Mr Adams said the government had reopened its secret contacts with Sinn Fein to advise it to expect a date shortly for exploratory talks. Earlier Mr Adams and Mr John Hume, leader of the mainly Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party, issued their first joint statement since the IRA ceasefire. They urged the government to be more positive in its attitude to the peace process. Mr Adams has also been invited by Mr Anthony Lake, President Bill Clinton's national security adviser, to meet him at the White House next week to discuss ways of advancing the peace process.

0,FT934-580 ,"FT934-580 _AN-DLXCEAAHFT 931224   FT  24 DEC 93 / Peace hopes hit as IRA limits truce to three days: Sinn Fein official hints at future action against troops      By TIM COONE and DAVID OWEN   A top Sinn Fein official dealt a blow to Anglo-Irish efforts to bring peace to Northern Ireland, as the IRA announced last night that its traditional Christmas ceasefire would last only the usual 72 hours. Mr Martin McGuinness, a key figure in the Republican leadership, used a newspaper interview to hint that last week's Downing Street declaration would not be enough to persuade the IRA to end its 25-year armed struggle. The political situation had not 'developed to a position where Sinn Fein can use its influence to end attacks on the British Crown forces', Mr McGuinness said. His remarks came as nearly 450 prisoners - many convicted of terrorist offences and 100 serving life sentences - were let out of the province's jails to spend Christmas with their families. Coming just a week after the Major-Reynolds declaration, the traditional Christmas exodus is expected to fuel debate over whether to embrace the peace process. Senior IRA men released yesterday at the same time as loyalist prisoners are expected to be involved in talks with Sinn Fein leaders about their response to the joint declaration. That may add to pressure on Republican leaders to demand an amnesty for IRA prisoners as part of any peace deal. Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, called this week for all IRA prisoners to be released as part of a negotiated settlement - a position echoed by Mr McGuinness. Meanwhile, the acquittal of two Royal Marines charged with attempting to murder two Roman Catholic brothers in a checkpoint shooting added to tension in the province. Mr Seamus Mallon, deputy leader of the mainly Roman Catholic SDLP, said he was 'very depressed' by the verdict, which was also condemned by Mr Tom Hartley, Sinn Fein's national chairman. Interviewed in the Derry Journal, Mr McGuinness - who played an important role in this year's secret contacts between Sinn Fein and the British government - said that last week's declaration had to be 'backed by actions'. Taken alone, 'for all its grand phraseology', it was 'not going to solve the problems'. He warned that any reintroduction of internment would be 'a recipe for disaster' leading to another 25 years of violence. Downing Street responded to Mr McGuinness's comments by reiterating that it was interested only in a permanent cessation of violence leading to a lasting peace. Mr McGuinness's statement coincided with an announcement by the IRA of a 'temporary suspension' of their campaign for 72 hours, starting at midnight. The IRA announces a three-day ceasefire every Christmas, but hopes had been raised that a longer ceasefire would be announced this year to give scope for the peace initiative to gather further momentum. The prisoners, selected from the 1,845 in custody in the province, are due to return to the Maze, Maghaberry and other prisons by December 30. Some 20 IRA prisoners were let out of jails in the Irish Republic yesterday under similar arrangements. The UK release scheme was introduced in 1948 and is confined to Northern Ireland. It was extended five years ago to include 'lifers' who have served at least 11 years of their sentence.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.     IEZ  Ireland, EC.

He said the issue would not be resolved in bilateral meetings between the government and his party. On the eve of a second session of exploratory talks in Belfast between the two sides, at which the issue of guns and explosives is likely to be raised again, he said the process of demilitarisation could be addressed once the talks moved to all-inclusive dialogue involving all the parties. Mr Major has insisted that the IRA must give up its weapons before Sinn Fein can enter full negotiations on the future of Ulster. The Irish Republic's government is anxious not to let the issue delay the peace process. Mr John Bruton, the new prime minister, said yesterday: 'It is important to resolve this, not to get into a stand-off about it.' Mr Adams said the existence of all armed groups, including the army and loyalists, needed to be resolved by an effective demilitarisation process as part of the overall settlement. Meanwhile, the republic's new coalition government was yesterday embroiled in an immediate controversy after Mr Albert Reynolds, the outgoing prime minister, revealed details of confidential negotiations between London and Dublin on the Northern Ireland peace process. His comments drew criticism from the UK government, unionist MPs and politicians in the republic. Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, expressed surprise that Mr Reynolds should breach the confidentiality of the negotiations and said it would 'make things difficult for both sides'. Mr Reynolds, interviewed on BBC Radio at the weekend, said London had agreed that Dublin should have a role in future all-Ireland institutions covering areas such as tourism and transport - a move northern unionists believe is a step towards a united Ireland. The former Irish prime minister, forced to resign over a judicial appointment scandal last month, said an all-Ireland body would have executive powers and be drawn from representatives in Dublin and a future parliament in Northern Ireland. Mr Reynolds said substantive talks involving British ministers and Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, should begin now and troops should be taken off the streets. He said Downing Street's precondition that weapons be handed in or destroyed could seriously threaten the ceasefire. Mr Reynolds said the all-Ireland body was among proposals in a new framework document which London and Dublin hoped would form the basis for all-party talks on the province's future. The document is due to be published early next year and is expected to be discussed when Mr Major meets Mr Bruton next week.   Countries:-  IEZ  Ireland, EC.     GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

0,FT934-11927 ,"FT934-11927 _AN-DJ2DCAAEFT 931029   FT  29 OCT 93 / Major to support fresh N Ireland peace initiative: London and Dublin hope to sideline Hume-Adams talks      By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor   MR JOHN MAJOR and Mr Albert Reynolds will back a new political initiative today to bring peace in Northern Ireland based on secret talks between the London and Dublin governments. The two leaders will consider joint proposals for a new constitutional settlement which includes fundamental changes to the Irish constitution and the creation of a number of powerful executive boards to increase cross-border co-operation. They are determined to regain the initiative at the end of a week of escalating violence, which started last Saturday with an IRA bomb which killed 10 people in the mainly Protestant Shankill Road. The bloodshed continued last night with the shooting dead of two Catholic brothers, aged 18 and 20, in the living room of their home at Bleary, near Warringstown, Co Down. Loyalists were blamed for the murders. The proposals, drafted in outline over recent weeks by a working party of civil servants from London and Dublin, would provide an 'umbrella' for the restart of negotiations between political parties in the province. The move is also designed to sideline the parallel talks between Mr John Hume, leader of the Social Democratic and Labour Party, and Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, and persuade the parties to talk again. Dublin, however, wants some of the Hume-Adams proposals included in a broader settlement. The outcome of today's meeting, at the margins of the European summit in Brussels, may not be spelled out in detail given the political sensitivity of the peace process. But they will form the basis for more talks next week between Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, and Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary. The 'guiding principles' for any agreement, set out this week in the Dublin parliament by Mr Spring, received a strong positive response from London yesterday. Officials stress that the provisions of this fresh joint Irish-UK initiative would only come into effect as part of an overall settlement. That in turn would depend on agreement between the SDLP and the Unionist parties on the shape of internal political arrangements in the province to replace government from Westminster. Both sides acknowledge that considerable obstacles remain. But at the heart of any intergovernmental settlement would be a commitment by the republic to replace its constitutional claim to jurisdiction over Northern Ireland with an aspiration to achieve a united Ireland. It return Britain would formally acknowledge the legitimacy of that aspiration and would agree to the establishment of a number of cross-border executive boards in such areas as transport, dealings with the European Community's social funds and tourism. Mr Spring's clear declaration that the consent of the people of Northern Ireland was essential for any change in the status of the province was warmly welcomed in Downing Street. Mr Major told MPs he looked forward to discussing the 'positive' proposals with Mr Reynolds. There was acknowledgment in Whitehall that the peace process drawn up by Mr Hume and Mr Adams still presents political hazards for any intergovernmental settlement. Mr Reynolds, who is expected to outline the Hume-Adams plan in today's meeting, believes some elements could be incorporated into an agreement between the two governments. Dublin also believes it must take seriously the prospect of an IRA ceasefire.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.     IEZ  Ireland, EC.   Industries:-  P9711 National Security.

0,FT944-8536 ,"FT944-8536 _AN-EKTAWAB0FT 941119   FT  19 NOV 94 / One more element of doubt: How London views this week's events      By DAVID OWEN   The UK government is doing its best to play down the impact of the power vacuum in Dublin on the Northern Ireland peace process. From London's perspective, there is nothing to be gained by adding to the sense of crisis that Mr Albert Reynolds's resignation has threatened to stir up. Most leading Ulster politicians have come round to a similar position. Even Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, emphasised this week that the peace process was 'bigger than any of us' - although he warned of 'widespread concern' among nationalists about the effects of Mr Reynolds's removal. Mr Adams's choice of words was uncannily similar to that of Mr David Ervine of the Progressive Unionist party, which speaks for some loyalist paramilitaries. According to Mr Ervine, 'this is a bigger issue than any individual'. Both moderate and hardline unionists have indicated that on balance they think the peace process will gain from the fall of a prime minister whom they felt was influenced to an uncomfortable degree by Mr Adams. More important, they argue, is whether the IRA is ready to renounce violence permanently. Many unionists remain unconvinced. Mr William Ross, the Ulster Unionist chief whip, says: 'I have always been sceptical and I have seen nothing in recent weeks or days to change my mind.' However, the collapse of the Dublin coalition has added new elements of doubt to a process that was already difficult. The piece of the jigsaw most clearly in danger is the much-delayed joint framework document the two governments have been striving to agree. This document will form the basis of future talks involving Ulster's principal political parties. At its heart will be a constitutional trade-off under which Dublin would remove its territorial claim to the province in return for changes to the 1920 Government of Ireland Act enshrining partition. Speaking within hours of Mr Reynolds's resignation, senior British officials said the two governments were 'close' to agreement. But this week's events are unlikely to help the work of the so-called 'liaison committee' of British and Irish officials who are working on the framework document. The pace of progress on exploratory talks with Sinn Fein and loyalist representatives - due to start before Christmas, provided the ceasefire holds - may also be slowed. This is because the liaison committee has yet to complete its work on developing a co-ordinated north-south approach to decommissioning paramilitary arsenals. The British government expects the handover of these weapons to be close to the top of the agenda when these talks get under way. Unless the committee continues to work while a new Irish government emerges, London may have to start the talks before the liaison committee's report is ready. Officials can pursue technical points in the absence of a government in Dublin, but they will soon need fresh political direction. Another imponderable is the personal chemistry between Mr Major and the new Irish premier. While the UK prime minister and Mr Reynolds had their disagreements, they seemed to be on the same wavelength. This was invaluable in underpinning the peace process's credibility at moments when relations between London and Dublin were strained. London will be keen for Mr Dick Spring, leader of the Irish Labour party, to retain a prominent role in the process. This would ensure an element of continuity. Although Mr Major has won plaudits for his handling of the peace process, there was a growing feeling, even before this week, that time was beginning to press. Events in Dublin have reinforced that feeling, but have also made it more difficult for the two governments to respond to it.   Countries:-  IEZ  Ireland, EC.     GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

The meeting follows a renewed surge of violence by both the IRA and loyalist paramilitaries in Northern Ireland, and a failed but potentially devastating bomb attack in Dublin last weekend by the loyalist Ulster Volunteer Force. Dublin officials said that tomorrow's meeting had been arranged before the upsurge in violence, to coincide with other functions the Irish prime minister has planned in London and Oxford. New security measures are expected to include additional police checkpoints on roads north of Dublin and leading from the border. Police and army chiefs were in talks throughout yesterday and the army said that additional troops 'will be available to support the Gardai as required'. Up to 2,000 of Ireland's 13,000 troops are deployed on border security duties at any one time, supported by helicopters, spotter planes and bomb-disposal teams. On average some 35 checkpoints on border roads are manned by army personnel every day, and more than 30 patrols per day are carried out along the border. Any movements of commercial explosives - from the time they enter the country to their moment of detonation - are escorted and monitored by army personnel. Yesterday, Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, sought to emphasise that next month's European election should not be treated in the province as a referendum on the Downing Street Declaration. Launching the Conservative party manifesto in Belfast, Sir Patrick said the election mattered because it was about 'our jobs and our identity'. He said Britain's opt-out from the 'suffocating' social chapter of the Maastricht treaty meant more jobs for Ulster, a region plagued by high unemployment.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

In a speech in the republican stronghold of west Belfast, the Sinn Fein president said 'genuine' peace in Ireland depended upon the British government's recognition of the right of the Irish people to determine their own future. 'Partition and continued support for the loyalist veto are a recipe for ongoing conflict,' Mr Adams warned. Downing Street said last night it would study Mr Adams's words carefully, but 'what the people in Northern Ireland need is a signal that the terrorists will call a permanent cessation of their violence'. Mr Adams's speech came as Mr John Major accused the IRA's political wing of being desperate to avoid a decision on whether to accept the Downing Street declaration. The British prime minister sought to increase pressure on republican leaders by describing their calls for clarification as 'an increasingly desperate attempt to avoid facing up to the clear choice that confronts them'. Last night's developments overshadowed concern expressed earlier on both sides of the Irish border about calls by Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, for 'demilitarisation' in Northern Ireland. Speaking little more than a day after Mr Martin McGuinness, another senior Sinn Fein spokesman, dismissed as unacceptable any British offer short of eventual withdrawal, Mr Adams called on London and Dublin to make the 'exercise of Irish national self-determination' their 'policy objective'. 'Partitionist solutions cannot create the conditions of peace and democracy in Ireland,' Mr Adams said. 'Since the partition of Ireland, the Irish people's right to self-determination has been denied by the British government and parliament. Partition represents the most fundamental denial of democracy.' The Sinn Fein president acknowledged that the joint declaration contained 'for the first time ever' a recognition by Britain that the Irish people 'as a whole' had the right to self-determination. But he said the 'deadlock' had not yet been broken. He also acknowledged the right of unionists - whom he called 'the Irish minority' - to be consulted. Downing Street has taken great pains to reassure unionists that the joint declaration did nothing to dilute their effective veto over any change in the province's constitutional status. Addressing MPs on the day the joint declaration was agreed last month, Mr Major stated specifically that the document contained no suggestion that Northern Ireland's future status 'should be decided by a single act of self-determination by the people of Ireland as whole'. Writing in this morning's edition of the unionist Belfast Newsletter, Mr Major pledged to pursue 'with renewed vigour' the so-called three-stranded talks which began in 1992. Mr Major said that agreement in the talks, which involve constitutional parties in London, Dublin and Belfast, was a 'priority' for 1994. Sinn Fein is excluded from the process, but Mr Major confirmed that the party would be allowed to take part three months after a cessation of IRA violence. In a passage aimed at the Reverend Ian Paisley, leader of the hard-line Democratic Unionist party, Mr Major said suggestions that the joint declaration was a sell-out were 'nonsense'. But unionists reacted angrily to the Irish prime minister's assertion that 'the time has come to start the process of demilitarisation of the Northern conflict'.

0,FT944-4839 ,"FT944-4839 _AN-ELGCWAALFT 941207   FT  07 DEC 94 / Ireland poised for election as talks on coalition collapse      By JOHN MURRAY BROWN, Ireland Correspondent   Ireland was last night heading for an early general election after talks on the formation of a new coalition broke down. The impasse came amid fresh allegations about outgoing prime minister Albert Reynolds' controversial handling of a judicial appointment. Mr Dick Spring, the Irish Labour party leader, abandoned negotiations with Fianna Fail, the largest party, hours before yesterday's scheduled session of the Dail, which would have approved the formation of a new government. Last night Labour was trying to forge a left-right coalition with the main opposition party, Fine Gael, and one of the smaller parties in the hope of avoiding an election. However, MPs held out little hope for such a pact. If a coalition does not emerge in the next few days, Mr Reynolds will be forced to dissolve parliament and call an election. Mr Spring appealed to all parties to solve the crisis quickly because of its likely effect on the Northern Ireland peace process. 'A prolonged period of instability that could result from an election would do potential damage to the progress towards peace and reconciliation in Ireland,' he told parliament. The collapse of talks between Labour and Fianna Fail comes at a critical moment in the peace process, three days before the UK government starts exploratory talks with Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing. Speaking in Belfast, Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, seemed keen to play down the crisis. However, he conceded that the delays would create a 'hiatus' in the negotiations to devise a framework document which the two governments hope will form the basis for talks on a constitutional settlement for Ulster. The judicial row that led to the collapse of the Irish government centres on Mr Harry Whelehan, the former attorney-general. Mr Whelehan allegedly failed to process UK extradition warrants for a paedophile Roman Catholic priest who was later convicted of child abuse offences in Northern Ireland. Mr Reynolds reiterated in parliament that he had not tried to mislead parliament over the affair. But the Irish Times newspaper reported on Monday that the prime minister had deliberately deceived parliament by not disclosing his attempt to persuade Mr Whelehan to resign as attorney-general a day before publicly defending him in parliament. On Monday, Mr Spring demanded that Mr Eoghan Fitzsimons, the new attorney-general, provide a written explanation of the sequence of events. Mr Reynolds hurried back from the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe summit in Budapest to answer parliamentary questions. 'We are not happy with the answers we got . . . We've broken off negotiations with Fianna Fail at this stage,' Mr Spring said as he left the Dail yesterday. 'It's very serious,' said Mr Bertie Ahern, the new leader of Fianna Fail. 'We were hoping we'd form a government. That's not going to be the case.' Mr Ahern seemed visibly shaken by the new set of allegations. He said the party was resigned to a period in opposition or a general election. 'We're living through one of the saddest episodes in our parliamentary history,' said Ms Mary Harney, leader of the Progressive Democrats, a former coalition partner.

Although historic exploratory talks between the UK government and Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, were seen as constructive, sharp differences emerged over the timing of the disposal of IRA arms and explosives. After the first public talks between UK officials and Sinn Fein in 25 years of troubles, the two sides appeared on a collision course. The government insisted that the decommissioning of the IRA's arsenal would be a condition to Sinn Fein being allowed to enter all-party talks on the future of Ulster. Mr Michael Ancram, the Northern Ireland political affairs minister, said after a briefing by Mr Quentin Thomas, head of the UK's five-man delegation, that 'their continued retention will constitute a barrier to other political parties, as well as to the government itself, in joining with Sinn Fein in substantive political negotiations'. The minister warned that if the talks are 'to be taken to a successful conclusion, then the question of the decommissioning of arms must be resolved to satisfaction'. Nevertheless, he called the meeting 'constructive and business-like' while Mr Martin McGuinness, leading the five-strong Sinn Fein delegation, said it was 'a good beginning'. Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, however, warned the government that it should not place conditions on the talks process. 'History will judge the British badly if they make excuses for not moving the peace process forward,' he said. The exploratory meeting at the former Northern Ireland parliament building at Stormont Castle in Belfast came exactly 100 days after the announcement of the IRA ceasefire. Condemned by hardline unionists, the meeting is viewed as an important part of wider negotiations started by the British and Irish governments, which aim to bring all the political parties in Ulster into discussions to craft a constitutional framework for the province. Mr John Major, who received a report on the meeting at the European Union summit in Essen, told other EU leaders that contacts with the republicans were designed to turn a 'ceasefire into a lasting peace'. He underlined that London and Dublin were close to a framework agreement to provide the basis for round-table talks on a new political settlement. Mr Ancram said yesterday's discussion had raised a 'very large areas of subjects'. Both sides had 'a good trot around the course', he said. Mr McGuinness, said the talks 'should have happened a long time ago'. The two sides agreed to meet again on December 19. Meanwhile, the Ulster Democratic party, one of the loyalist groups invited to talks next week with UK officials, warned it was reconsidering the invitation because of the presence at the Stormont meeting of a councillor from the Irish Republic. Sinn Fein delegates, who included the Old Bailey bomber Mr Gerry Kelly, called for an end to British military operations and a speedy release of all political prisoners. Sinn Fein said these issues should be addressed as a matter of urgency. Sinn Fein comes in from the cold, Page 6 New tune for Irish reel, Page 9   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Mr Martin McGuinness, a member of the ruling executive of the IRA's political wing, said the government's decision to respond to republican calls for clarification of the UK-Irish document represented 'a small step in the slowly evolving peace process'. Sinn Fein was determined to play a full and positive role in an effective peace process, which must 'embrace everyone and exclude no one'. Mr McGuinness's remarks came less than 24 hours after London stepped up pressure on the IRA to halt its 25-year campaign of violence by publishing a detailed commentary on Sinn Fein's 20 questions, answering one of them directly. The painstaking nature of the government's reply was welcomed by unionists and nationalists alike. Mr McGuinness hinted that Sinn Fein was unlikely to decide how to respond to the government's comments until after next month's European elections, saying its policy of undertaking broad consultations at all levels of its membership would cause a delay. Meanwhile, pressure on unionist paramilitaries to end their violence has intensified. Mr James Molyneaux, leader of the Ulster Unionist party, said yesterday that the Downing Street declaration had made clear there was no distinction between republican or loyalist paramilitary oganisations engaging in exploratory talks once the violence ended. Mr Ruairi Quinn, a senior Irish cabinet minister, said Sinn Fein's initial comments on the British response were encouraging. There were 'clearly tensions within the Sinn Fein-IRA movement'.

With expectations mounting of an imminent - and possibly historic - IRA announcement, Mr Reynolds said people would be able to make 'an entirely new beginning on this island' in 'a very short time'. 'A complete cessation of violence' - as demanded by the British and Irish governments - 'and the principles of the Downing Street declaration are our new starting point', Mr Reynolds said after a meeting of the Irish cabinet. He later had his second telephone conversation in just over 24 hours with Mr John Major, the UK prime minister. Downing Street said it was 'a matter of keeping in touch'. Mr Reynolds's comments came as the British government moved to counter Unionist suspicions that it had offered secret concessions to republican leaders to secure a ceasefire. Downing Street said no concessions had been made to anyone. In the US White House officials were said to be 'at fever pitch' over the improving prospects of peace. The Clinton administration is understood to be preparing to offer a large increase in financial aid to Ulster. The US already gives Dollars 20m (Pounds 12.9m) a year to the International Fund for Ireland, which is jointly administered by the UK and the Irish Republic. A permanent cessation of IRA violence would open the way for exploratory talks between Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, and the British government within three months. The talks would explore the basis for Sinn Fein's admittance into talks on the province's future and examine the practical consequences of the ending of violence. Mr John Hume, leader of the mainly Roman Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party, last night called for talks with Sinn Fein to begin 'a lot sooner than three months'. Yesterday's developments followed the first public acknowledgement by Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, that he had advised IRA leaders to consider halting their armed campaign. Later on Irish television he urged unionists to set aside their suspicions in the interests of peace. He said: 'If we are prepared to say let's put the last 25 years behind us . . . surely the unionists have within their ranks men and women of courage prepared to take the same risks as some of us have taken.' Senior Ulster Unionists appeared last night to have accepted London's assurances , with Mr James Molyneaux, the UUP leader, expressing confidence the government had no plans to change Ulster's constitutional position. But the Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the hardline Democratic Unionist party, warned angrily that a ceasefire achieved through the surrender of the British government could be 'a recipe for civil war'.

0,FT942-17435 ,"FT942-17435 _AN-EDECPABRFT 940405   FT  05 APR 94 / London and Dublin give ceasefire short shrift      By MICHAEL CASSELL and TIM COONE   The British and Irish governments yesterday remained united in a rejection of the three-day ceasefire which the IRA begins at midnight tonight to try to win 'clarification' of the Downing Street peace declaration. London and Dublin again criticised the short ceasefire as an inadequate gesture and made clear their exasperation at the IRA's refusal to declare a permanent end to violence, which they say could pave the way to lasting peace. The two governments hope their firm refusal to give any ground might encourage the IRA to consider an extension of the ceasefire, though there were no indications from the republican movement that such action is likely. Republicans continued to insist that the next move must come from the British government in the shape of an offer to open direct talks. One Easter rally yesterday heard a warning that Britain could expect more violence unless talks began. Dublin, which has already provided Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, with clarification of parts of the Downing Street declaration, is making clear that it will not put pressure on London to provide further clarification. Both governments have rejected suggestions that low-level talks might take place with Sinn Fein during the ceasefire. But in the unlikely event that it is extended beyond Friday, pressure to restart some form of contact would soon mount. Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, who is on holiday, is being kept abreast of developments, according to a government spokesman. But the latest statements from Sinn Fein leaders at the weekend 'have not changed the situation', he said. In separate speeches made on Sunday in Belfast and Dublin to commemorate the 1916 Easter rising, Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, and Mr Martin McGuinness, a prominent member of Sinn Fein's national executive, called on London to respond to the 'potential' offered by the ceasefire initiative. Cardinal Cahal Daly, the Roman Catholic Primate of all Ireland, yesterday added his weight to that pressure saying that a 'meaningful extension' of the ceasefire would help encourage a 'constructive response' from the British and Irish governments. Such hopes appeared to fade after a warning delivered at a rally in County Tyrone, Northern Ireland by two masked IRA men who said: 'The British will be glad to get out of Ireland when our work is done.' They claimed the republican movement in Tyrone had never been stronger, more united and confident and said last month's mortar bombings at Heathrow airport had 'worked wonders' for morale.

Speaking ahead of a meeting in London this weekend with John  Major, he again highlighted hopes that their peace initiative  would prompt a permanent end to Northern Ireland-linked  terrorism.    Mr Reynolds told the Irish parliament he was still  ""cautiously optimistic"" about the success prospects of the  two-month-old joint declaration.    The Irish premier, who meets Mr Major before the two leaders  attend Saturday's Twickenham rugby international between England  and Ireland, said they would be reviewing recent Northern  Ireland political developments. Northern Ireland Secretary Sir  Patrick Mayhew and Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring -- joint  chairmen of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference -- will  also be at the talks.    Mr Reynolds said the meeting would focus primarily on issues  connected with the peace declaration. ""We will review progress,  share assessments of the current position and examine approaches  of attaining our common objective of a lasting peace with  justice in Ireland.""    He said the advancement of political dialogue through a  resumed inter-party talks process would be discussed too.    Mr Reynolds refused to agree that Sinn Fein's annual  conference at the end of this month would signal the deadline  for its response to the peace bid.    Mr Reynolds is due to go to the U.S. for a period including  St Patrick's Day, March 17, when he will meet President Clinton.  He said he would ""avail of every appropriate opportunity to  present and promote in a balanced way the complexities of the  Northern Ireland conflict, as well as our efforts towards its  peaceful resolution.    ""This will be of particular importance during my discussions  with President Clinton and congressional leaders.""     "

Both governments are refusing to impose deadlines for a response from Sinn Fein, but it was suggested last night that a decision would be expected one way or the other by the time Sinn Fen holds its annual conference in Dublin at the end of the month. In spite of some irritation in Dublin over the British government's announced intention to press on with talks aimed at finding a political settlement in Ulster, both sides renewed criticism of Sinn Fein and urged it to make up its mind. Mr John Major, the British prime minister, and Mr Albert Reynolds, his Irish counterpart, are due to meet later this month to assess developments since the December declaration. Though they both accept that the visit to the US of Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, handed the party a valuable propaganda coup, they remain determined to drive home the message that the prospects for peace now lie in the hands of Sinn Fein and the IRA. In Londonderry, Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, said that he believed people had become 'very impatient' and that enough time had passed for a response to the declaration. He warned he might be prepared to go ahead with inter-party talks not only without Sinn Fein, but also without the Rev Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionist Party, which remains opposed to the Downing Street declaration. Mr Reynolds, speaking in Dublin, urged Sinn Fein to respond positively and, in a departure from earlier statements which was intended to maximise the chances of Sinn Fein acceptance, stressed that the declaration was 'essentially an Irish peace initiative'. There could be no renegotiation of the document 'though it may eventually be transcended'. In a reference to London's determination to press on with internal talks, Mr Reynolds stressed that the declaration emphasised 'peace first, negotiations afterwards'. He said the opposite approach had been tried among the constitutional parties 'with little sign of success so far'. He was non-committal however over a timetable for the resumption of constitutional talks. Mr Dick Spring, Irish foreign minister, said in Brussels that the Dublin government was looking for a clear sign to emerge from Sinn Fein's annual conference. 'It is make up your mind time,' he added.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.     IEZ  Ireland, EC.   Industries:-  P8651 Political Organizations.     P9711 National Security.

0,FT934-4474 ,"FT934-4474 _AN-DLCDFAEDFT 931203   FT  03 DEC 93 / Major rejects Dublin peace proposals      By PHILIP STEPHENS and DAVID OWEN   The sharp differences between London and Dublin over the shape of any settlement for Northern Ireland broke into the open last night on the eve of today's Anglo-Irish summit. As Mr John Major gave a public pledge that any deal must be acceptable to the Unionist majority in Northern Ireland, it emerged that the British prime minister had rejected a peace plan tabled by Mr Albert Reynolds, his Irish counterpart. The plan, sent to London last month, provided for the Dublin government to drop its constitutional claim to the north and to recognise that Irish unification could come only with the consent of a majority in Ulster. As a quid pro quo, the British side would have to agree to a document endorsing the value of eventual Irish unity and to early and simultaneous referendums in the republic and the north to provide a visible expression of 'self-determination'. Mr Reynolds wanted the plan to provide the basis of the communique after today's talks. The two leaders agreed to downgrade the status of the summit after acrimonious exchanges earlier in the week threatened at one stage to result in its cancellation. Dublin now refers to it as a 'working meeting' rather than a summit. It is understood that Mr Major was ready to accept a document framework that included explicit recognition of the legitimacy of the aspirations of Irish nationalists. But he rejected as unacceptable to moderate unionists the idea that Britain should tacitly support the goal of Irish unity by signing up to a statement proclaiming its 'value'. Mr Major also judged that the proposal for joint referendums on 'self-determination' would dilute his government's commitment to the Unionists' veto on constitutional change. Both sides were last night attempting to play down the rift. In London, it was suggested a short statement to be released after the talks would emphasise the two leaders' commitment to seek an agreement. Irish officials pointed out that by agreeing to a total of three working meetings during December there was still room for manoeuvre and hope for progress. Mr Major, anxious to reassure Mr James Molyneaux's Ulster Unionist party after the disclosure of the government's clandestine contacts with Sinn Fein, told MPs: 'There is for us one fundamental point: Northern Ireland's status as part of the United Kingdom will not change without the freely expressed consent of the people of northern Ireland.' Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, in a thinly- veiled reference to Mr Reynolds' plan, also rejected the idea the government could recognise the goal as well as the aspiration of Irish unity.

[Adams] No, never. Where did you get that idea from?    [Correspondent] Are you acquainted with the persons who  carried out this terrorist action?    [Adams] No. You forget that the Sinn Fein is separate from  the IRA.    [Correspondent] If you are not acquainted with IRA leaders,  how can you make the IRA stop its armed operations?    [Adams] One does not have to know the IRA activists  personally in order to move things along. My wish is to  demilitarize the Anglo-Irish conflict. Two armed groups are  facing each other in this conflict, the British Army and the  militant pro-British groups from Northern Ireland on the one  hand, and the relatively smaller IRA on the other. They must  all lay down their arms at the same time.    [Correspondent] You are the Irish politician with the  greatest influence on the IRA leadership because of your origins  as a Catholic-Republican resistance fighter. You cannot say you  have no connection with the IRA leadership.    [Adams] I have never dissociated myself from the IRA. That  would be a dishonorable thing to do. But while I am politically  active, the IRA is an armed, secret organization. I would like  it to stop its actions.    [Correspondent] Do you see any chance of that?    [Adams] The IRA is not going to stop unilaterally. In order  to speed the peace process along, I would like the British  Government to commence talks with our Sinn Fein. Then I could  go to the IRA and, hopefully, offer it a packet of solutions  that would permit it to reach a final decision on future policy.  The British Army has been trying to beat the IRA for 25 years.  But the IRA has not been beatable. On the contrary, it looks  as if the IRA could continue its armed actions forever.    [Correspondent] In other words, war to the very last?    [Adams] No. For Ireland, there is no military solution. We  have a political problem here, and it needs a political  solution. I have been trying to break the military stalemate  for years. Several times the IRA has publicly said that the  initiative coming from me and from John Hume, leader of the  Social Democratic party in Northern Ireland, could provide the  basis for peace. Hume and I suggested a roundtable of all  parties involved.    [Correspondent] Your credibility as a man of peace collapsed  when you were one of the pall-bearers of the coffin of the IRA  terrorist Thomas Begley, who killed nine persons in a bomb  attack in Belfast's Shankill Road. Does this gesture not have  the effect of a nod of approval to violence?    [Adams] What is violence? There is institutionalized  violence, the violence of the state. I was a victim of this  violence when the British Army locked me up for five years.    [Correspondent] Let us not get philosophical. What do you  say to the murder of innocent civilians?    [Adams] I am against that, of course. What happened in  Shankill Road was unforgivable and wrong.    [Correspondent] Then why do you help carry Begley's coffin?    [Adams] The man was dead. Why should I not carry his coffin  at his funeral? I am not going to leave Thomas Begley's family  alone in their grief. I would feel the same way about any  family that loses a 19 year old son. We cannot make teenagers  responsible for this conflict -- neither British soldiers, nor  young Protestants, nor IRA volunteers.    [Correspondent] After 25 years of bloodshed and 3,400  deaths, you said during your recent U.S. visit that ""this  generation is going to see peace in Ireland."" What makes you so  sure?    [Adams] The world climate of solving conflicts. If I had  said five years ago that Nelson Mandela would be released from  prison and become South Africa's president-designate, everyone  would have thought I was joking. The conflict seemed insoluble.    [Correspondent] Just like the conflict in Northern Ireland.    [Adams] I hope the progress in Africa also provides a signal  for people here in Ireland. The turnabout in South Africa  occurred because Mandela's enemy, the government of Pretoria,  was prepared to swallow the bitter pill and make concessions  that set the process in motion. The government in London should  learn something from that.    [Correspondent] Nonetheless, the London government has  already taken a big step and held secret talks with the IRA and  Sinn Fein. Do you think Prime Minister Major is determined to  find a political solution for Northern Ireland?    [Adams] British public opinion would surely approve the  taking of risks in order to achieve peace in Ireland, but  unfortunately Major is too much a victim of the obsessions of  his party's right wing, as well as being a victim of the  Unionists, the Northern Irish party that wants Northern Ireland  to belong to Great Britain at all costs. Major's weakness is an  obstacle to a peaceful solution. That is why we must seek other  ways of attaining our goal.    [Correspondent] London treats you like a persona non grata.  You cannot travel to England, Scotland, or Wales, and you  cannot be heard or seen on radio or television.    [Adams] That is just one example of the British Government's  stupidity.    [Correspondent] You and your family survive all attacks.  Once you were hit by five bullets when you entered a Belfast  restaurant. Do you feel in greater danger now that you are  involved in the peace process?    [Adams] I feel no hatred toward the people who tried to  shoot  me, nor toward those who might be planning to do so now. That  is the way things are here. Men act this way because they see  me as a danger to their interests. There is only one way: The  armed wings of the radical pro-British groups must be involved  in the peace process just like the IRA.    [Correspondent] Are you really prepared to sit down at the  negotiating table with your archenemies the Protestants?    [Adams] This has nothing to do with religion. My enemies  are not the Protestants. We are talking about political groups,  and they must all take part in the talks. There must be  dialogue without preconditions. Certain people have been  excluded for too long, and that is why no progress has been made.    [Correspondent] With your readiness for compromise, you will  also turn IRA hardliners into your opponents. For them, your  policy means treason. Do you not think that the next bullet  fired at you might come from an IRA weapon?    [Adams] No. The IRA would have to join the back of the line  of my potential assassins.     "

As the British government sought to reassure Unionists at Westminster by giving the go-ahead for a Northern Ireland parliamentary select committee, Mr Gerry Adams, president of the IRA's political wing, said he was still 'personally and politically' committed to helping secure peace in Northern Ireland. But he warned there were 'no quick fixes' to the province's problems. His statement reflected the difficulties the Republican movement is having in co-ordinating a response to the prime minister's main demand that the IRA should lay down its arms. It is understood that an early meeting between senior Sinn Fein officials and members of the IRA on Wednesday failed to produce an agreed response to the joint declaration. The final decision is in the hands of the IRA's Army Council which is understood not to have met in full session on the issue. Mr Adams said the Downing Street declaration was the product of 'frenzied activity' by the two governments after his talks with Mr John Hume, leader of the mainly Roman Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party, had 'focused them on this issue'. He would be seeking clarification from Dublin on some aspects of Wednesday's statement by the UK and Irish prime ministers. At Westminster, Mr Major came under pressure from his own back benches over whether the declaration diluted the government's commitment to the Union. In an acid exchange, he clashed with Mr Norman Lamont over the former chancellor's assertion that the declaration stood 'a little oddly' with his speech to the Conservative party conference in October. In contrast to the cross-party plaudits for the government on Wednesday, there were further backbench rumblings in the wake of a signal from Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, that the government might begin talks with Sinn Fein without waiting for the IRA to hand in its weapons. One Tory MP accused the government of giving in to terrorists. Downing Street said the select committee decision - announced yesterday by Mr Tony Newton, the Commons leader - was not related to the Anglo-Irish declaration on Northern Ireland, which was 'on a separate track'. Officials said the decision - which was not communicated in advance to Mr Reynolds or Mr James Molyneaux, the Ulster Unionist party leader - was taken by Mr Newton after consultation with Mr Major and Sir Patrick. The IRA last night claimed responsibility for two bombs discovered earlier by the track near Brookwood railway station, Surrey. Army teams blew up the packages at the station.

0,FT941-9654 ,"FT941-9654 _AN-EBNCXABCFT 940214   FT  14 FEB 94 / Republicans' turn at the wheel: The next moves in the Northern Ireland peace process depend on Sinn Fein and the IRA declaring their hands      By MICHAEL CASSELL   Lasting peace - or the threat of descent into a paramilitary-led bloodbath? With the British and Irish governments keeping up the pressure on Sinn Fein and the IRA to declare their hand in the push for a 'new beginning', the people of Northern Ireland await the next decisive turn of events in their troubled history. Try as they may to convince the republican movement that no group will be allowed to hold to ransom those searching for progress in Northern Ireland, both governments have to acknowledge that the movement also holds the key to a real breakthrough. Impatient politicians north and south refuse to set deadlines, although they have been trying gently to push for a republican decision on the Downing Street declaration by the time of Sinn Fein's annual conference in two weeks. Yesterday, however, Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, slapped down the idea of an early response. In Ulster there are those who believe that, whatever his movement does or does not say in the short term, the historic tide has turned and that the peace process is now unstoppable. But others invoke history to predict failure and an unprecedented armed struggle. But if Sinn Fein's holding position becomes untenable and it is forced into making the next move, what are its options? If it were able to deliver an unequivocal 'yes' to the joint declaration - regarded as the least likely scenario by both governments - the immediate path ahead is clear. After a three-month ceasefire, Sinn Fein can join an exploratory dialogue covering security questions, participation in the political talks process and a start to demilitarisation in the province. But a 'yes' would require the British government to move quickly to reassure moderate unionists - who have accepted but never endorsed the declaration - that their position within the union remains secure. Their stance might certainly be tested to breaking point as Sinn Fein paid its first official call on Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary. For its part, Dublin would at once invite Sinn Fein to join the proposed all-Ireland Forum for Peace and Reconciliation. Mr Ian Paisley and his hardline Democratic Unionists would be even further out on a limb, maintaining their boycott of the talks process and standing aside from a 'treasonable sell-out'. The DUP is demanding that Mr John Major, the prime minister, abandons the declaration, although its attempt last week in a Belfast by-election to seek a mandate for its uncompromising stand failed badly. A more probable development, however, is that Sinn Fein might deliver qualified acceptance of the declaration, perhaps involving a temporary ceasefire. The gesture would switch the political initiative back to the two governments, again casting Sinn Fein as the party set on the search for peace and further probing any fault lines in the relationship between Dublin and London. Although both administrations have insisted that only a permanent ceasefire will do, there have already been hints that Dublin might see a respite in violence as sufficient grounds for allowing Sinn Fein to join the proposed forum. Sinn Fein would then have prised open the door marked 'concessions' a little further. But if Sinn Fein, for the sake of retaining republican unity, says 'no', Dublin - which has wanted the joint declaration to take priority over the talks process until Sinn Fein declared its hand - will be obliged to join London in pursuing the widest possible dialogue on the political way forward. The Irish government has set itself firmly against a return to the 'the bad old days of Stormont domination'. The unionists' priority will be for a devolved assembly along the lines set out during the 'three-stranded' talks. Mr James Molyneux, the Ulster Unionist leader, now says it could be up and running before the end of next year. The Social Democratic and Labour party, however, is deeply suspicious of what it can expect from an assembly. Sir Patrick and Mr John Hume, the SDLP leader, would have to work hard on relationships between the people of north and south in order to get the party to participate in a new chamber. The chances of making much progress, however, against a background of continuing violence might not be high. But while the political options ahead are aired, it is the reaction of those who have engaged in the tit-for-tat war of atrocities which is least predictable and most critical. Some believe that, if the latest initiative fails, the IRA will not be able to return to the old levels of violence without alienating many republicans brought to the brink of peace. 'They might be content to give people an occasional reminder, maybe on the mainland, that they are still in business', said one security source. But another warned: 'Any IRA 'no' in the form of new atrocities will see the loyalist paramilitaries go berserk. It could be the bloodiest year ever. And if republican violence ends, will loyalists put away their own arms and watch Sinn Fein at the negotiating table? They have their own agenda as well'. In spite of the talk of a security 'crackdown', the reality is that there are no secret weapons in the security forces' locker and they know they must be careful not to give the IRA any new opportunities for building fresh support. On Saturday, Mr Major and Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish premier, will meet before watching the England-Ireland rugby match at Twickenham and declare that the peace process continues. The reality will be that, off the pitch, the waiting game goes on.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.     IEZ  Ireland, EC.   Industries:-  P9721 International Affairs.

Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, said he believed there were 'still grounds for reasonable hope' that Sinn Fein would respond positively to the Downing Street peace declaration. But he stressed that talks - to be based on the document - would not wait for its decision. He added: 'We are ready to go at any time.' His suggestion that Mr Ian Paisley's DUP would also be unable to veto political progress was immediately backed by Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary. Sir Patrick said: 'We should not permit the process to be halted by the action of those who are eligible to join in but who say, 'No we are not coming'.' The DUP has refused to join the talks unless the British government abandons the Downing Street declaration. Mr Reynolds, speaking on BBC television, said his meeting on Saturday with Mr John Major, the prime minister, had allayed concerns that future talks might be narrowly based on an internal political settlement in Ulster. Mr Reynolds said both sides now had a clearly agreed starting point for the next talks, which would embrace the so-called three-stranded process. He said he believed the mainly nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party, which has not yet committed itself to the talks, would be 'content and happy' with the outcome of the weekend talks. It is understood that the SDLP, in an unpublicised session, met Sir Patrick last week to discuss his 'check-list' of ideas for political progress which have been submitted to Dublin. Although London has, in return for assurances about the scope of the talks, persuaded Dublin to commit itself to pressing on with them, both governments will maintain a low-key approach at least until after Sinn Fein's annual conference outside Dublin next weekend.

But Sinn Fein leader Mr Gerry Adams declined to shed further light on his claim on Monday night that Sinn Fein had been in 'protracted contact and dialogue' with the British government. Mr Adams' claim was yesterday emphatically denied by Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, as Ulster unionist MPs and Tory right-wingers warned the government to tread carefully. The offer by Mr John Major on Monday night was the first explicit move by the British prime minister to negotiate with the IRA's political wing. Sir Patrick said: 'No officials have been talking to Sinn Fein on behalf of the British government. We have always made it perfectly clear that there is going to be no negotiating with anybody who perpetrates or justifies the use of violence. That has been our policy and we stick to it.' The government has said the only contacts made with Sinn Fein have been those permitted at local and constituency level. Sinn Fein said privately last night that Mr Adams would not 'have said what he said' if he could not prove it. There were reports in the province last night that Mr Martin McGuinness, the Sinn Fein official, was involved in the contacts Mr Adams claimed took place. Mr Adams said yesterday: 'Mr Major has acknowledged the opportunity which exists. The onus remains on John Major to deal honestly and directly with the core issues.' He did not spell out what concessions the IRA was looking for, but added that Sinn Fein remained 'firmly committed' to what he called the 'Irish peace initiative'. The impression of intense behind-the-scenes activity to get talks started was reinforced when Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, hinted that his government might have had indirect talks with Sinn Fein. Responding to questions in the Dail (parliament), he said: 'No week passes that I do not have people from both communities . . . keeping me informed as to their views of the shift in opinion from various sectors.' Northern Ireland's unionist politicians have been united in their hostility to Mr Major's speech, however. The Reverend Martin Smyth, the Ulster Unionist MP for South Belfast, said his party's support for Mr Major would be called into question if there was any sign that he was failing to govern Northern Ireland 'purposefully'. But he added: 'If the IRA are prepared to put down their arms, then that may create a new situation . . . I accept that is the harsh reality of politics.' The Democratic Unionist Party, led by the Reverend Ian Paisley, was more critical. 'The strength of feeling in this province is for the defeat of IRA/Sinn Fein, not that a way should be made for them to get to the negotiating table,' he said.

But Mr Reynolds' comment that written questions about the declaration from Sinn Fein were 'answerable' coincided with the murder by the IRA of another British soldier in a rocket attack on an army outpost in Armagh. Speaking in the US where he held unscheduled talks at the weekend with Mr Bill Clinton, the US president, Mr Reynolds, also indicated that Dublin and London would not wait indefinitely for a positive response from the Republican movement. Mr Reynolds, pictured above right with Mr Clinton during a ceremony in Indianapolis honouring Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr, told RTE radio: 'The questions by and large are answerable, and I hope that the British government will see them in that light, and will give the most positive response they can.' He added: 'I think the vast majority of people in Ireland - and Britain - want to see a breakthrough, and move this latest roadblock out of the way.' But in a speech in Chicago where he received an honorary degree from the University of Notre Dame, Mr Reynolds displayed his frustration at the IRA's refusal to end its campaign. Stressing the two governments' commitment to secure a new broad-ranging political accord to replace the Anglo-Irish agreement of 1985, Mr Reynolds said: 'The leaders of the Republican movement know that we still hope they will opt to play their part . . . They must also know, as Edmund Burke once put it, that there is a limit at which forbearance ceases to be a virtue.' Mr Michael Ancram, Northern Ireland minister, signalled that the two governments were drafting plans for a comprehensive political settlement. British ministers said the questions submitted by Sinn Fein, passed to the London government by Dublin last week, would be published within the next few days. Alongside them would be the government's responses. But Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, was determined that Britain would not be drawn into negotiations on the declaration unless and until the IRA ended permanently its campaign of violence. Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, gave a clear hint during a weekend meeting of the areas in which the IRA was seeking clarification.

0,FT944-1786 ,"FT944-1786 _AN-ELSDLAANFT 941219   FT  19 DEC 94 / Road ahead for Irish premier well signposted      By JOHN MURRAY BROWN      DUBLIN   Mr John Bruton, Ireland's new premier, has a boyish candour which often makes him seem out of place in the wheeler-dealing atmosphere of Irish politics. Yet, after his more than 20 years in the Dail, there are few politicians with a more acute knowledge of the workings of parliament. At 47, and with a wealth of ministerial portfolios under his belt, the real question is whether he has the qualities of diplomacy and political toughness that Ireland needs at this watershed in its history. Ireland is entering uncharted waters. The Northern Ireland peace process is at a critical juncture as paramilitaries enter exploratory talks with UK officials and unionists await the publication of the important joint framework document which London and Dublin hope will form the basis for all-party talks on Ulster's future. Mr Bruton will enter the process at the head of an uneasy coalition of conservative and radical elements led by Fine Gael, an essentially conservative party, and including Labour, the party of modern European secular politics, and the Democratic Left, the successor of the Official IRA. Personality problems may resurface. Mr Bruton believes he was let down when Mr Dick Spring, leader of the Labour party, went into coalition with Fianna Fail in 1992. The two politicians also squabbled over economic policy in the last Fine Gael-Labour coalition, which fell in 1987. Today one key difference is that not only is there a shared determination to keep Fianna Fail out of office, but the economy's strength will make decisions on sensitive issues like public spending less divisive. Mr Bruton's first task is to assert control over his own party machine. A challenge in the short term is unlikely but any slip could precipitate one. The policy objectives are well signposted. On Northern Ireland, Mr Bruton's team will have to pick up where the outgoing government left off, while stamping its own character on the peace process. How he will balance the need to keep hardline republicans harnessed to the peace process, without compromising his sympathies for the northern unionists, is difficult to see. In a deliberately low-key acceptance address to the Dail last week, Mr Bruton stressed his greatest concern was to see progress sustained. If the outgoing administration secured the peace, he said, his task would be to foster the 'reconciliation' of the island's two religious traditions. In the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation on Friday, his first meeting with Mr Gerry Adams, leader of Sinn Fein (the IRA's political wing), provided little more than a cursory handshake. Few believe Mr Bruton can replicate the rapport Fianna Fail enjoyed with the republicans. Fine Gael, historically identified as the party which voted for the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921 which enshrined partition, is still not comfortable with Sinn Fein. But in Mr Prionsias De Rossa, Democratic Left leader, Mr Bruton will have a useful ally. A former IRA internee, Mr De Rossa provides ample evidence of the benefits that accrue to those republicans who abandon the bullet in favour of the ballot box. On social questions like divorce and abortion there is more common ground between the parties. Mr Bruton campaigned in favour of legalising divorce when it was last put to a referendum in 1986. All three parties seem agreed it may be over-ambitious to contemplate winning backing in a referendum substantive reforms legalising abortion, although there may be a good chance of passing legislation on an abortion information bill allowing women to be referred by doctors to specialists outside Ireland. Perhaps the area where there will be most strain will be on the economy. Mr Bruton's Fine Gael is the party of low taxation and tight spending. Labour and the more radical Democratic Left will want to take a more Keynesian approach, injecting spending into the economy to create jobs and reduce the burden of poverty for the lower paid and unemployed. Mr Bruton's first test is to see a new budget through parliament. Democratic Left, in charge of the big spending social welfare portfolio, is expected to push for a mildly expansionary budget in an attempt to ease unemployment. Mr Bruton's budget record is far from convincing. In 1982, when he was finance minister in Dr Garret Fitzgerald's coalition, his attempts to impose VAT on child clothing and shoes was opposed by independents. This led to the defeat of his budget, and eventually the coalition's downfall.   Countries:-  IEZ  Ireland, EC.   Industries:-  P9111 Executive Offices.   Types:-  PEOP  People.

0,FT941-6879 ,"FT941-6879 _AN-EB1DPABDFT 940228   FT  28 FEB 94 / McGuinness demands pledge on veto      By MICHAEL CASSELL, TIM COONE and DAVID OWEN   The IRA would suspend its campaign of violence if the British government made clear that unionists did not hold a veto over the political progress in Northern Ireland, Mr Martin McGuinness, a member of Sinn Fein's national executive, said yesterday. Mr McGuinness, identified by sources in Whitehall as IRA chief of staff, told the Financial Times that events were possibly 'close to a dramatic breakthrough' which could enable early talks involving the government and Sinn Fein to take place. However last night, in a further setback for the peace process, Mr Ken Maginnis, deputy leader of the Ulster Unionists, said his party would not take part in talks on the same basis as in the last round-table table talks, which broke up in 1992. 'We will not let ourselves be tied down to the three-strands process where nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.' This did not imply the party would not enter a talks process but 'at present there is nothing on offer in strands two and three' he said, referring to the talks involving Dublin. The party will today publish proposals for devolved government in Northern Ireland in a move likely to increase tensions surrounding attempts to find a political settlement. Today's document is expected to dismay nationalists by arguing that a blueprint for devolved government in Ulster is needed before progress can be made on cross-border co-operation. At the end of Sinn Fein's annual conference in Dublin Mr McGuinness said it was 'crucially important' that Britain confronted uncertainties surrounding the question of Irish self-determination. He pointed out that Mr Albert Reynolds, Irish prime minister, had repeatedly said the unionists did not have a veto on political progress. In private communications with Sinn Fein, Mr Reynolds had also pointed out that Downing Street had never contradicted him. Mr McGuinness added: 'The implication of what Reynolds is saying to us is that if they have not contradicted him they must agree with him. If they agree with him, tell us about it and we are in business. We are moving.' Asked if a ceasefire would then be possible he said: 'A dramatic statement from the British government on the issue of the veto will deserve a dramatic response from the IRA. And that means a suspension of IRA operations.' Mr McGuinness said all sides would have to make concessions to break what Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, described as the present 'stalemate' in the search for peace. Mr Adams said on Saturday that the government would have to withdraw political support from the unionists. But London is pledged, with Dublin, to press on with the peace process and insists that before Sinn Fein is admitted to talks the IRA must renounce violence. Today's Ulster Unionist document is expected to underline the gulf separating participants in the political talks by arguing that north-south relations should be maintained by ad hoc meetings between Irish ministers and representatives of a devolved Ulster assembly, rather than by separate institutions. The document is expected to argue that most legislative power should remain at Westminster, at least until any new assembly has found its feet.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

0,FT941-10822 ,"FT941-10822 _AN-EBHC6AB0FT 940208   FT  08 FEB 94 / Sinn Fein faces renewed pressure      By MICHAEL CASSELL and TIM COONE      BELFAST, DUBLIN   The British and Irish governments yesterday mounted a fresh show of unity to step up pressure on Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, to accept the Downing Street peace declaration. Both governments are refusing to impose deadlines for a response from Sinn Fein, but it was suggested last night that a decision would be expected one way or the other by the time Sinn Fein holds its annual conference in Dublin at the end of the month. Mr John Major, the British prime minister, and Mr Albert Reynolds, his Irish counterpart, are to meet later this month to assess developments since the December declaration. Although they accept that the visit to the US of Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, handed the party a valuable propaganda coup, they remain determined to drive home the message that the prospects for peace lie in the hands of Sinn Fein and the IRA. In Londonderry, Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, said he believed people had become 'very impatient' and enough time had passed for a response to the declaration. He warned he might be prepared to go ahead with inter-party talks not only without Sinn Fein, but also without the Rev Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionist party, which remains opposed to the Downing Street declaration. Mr Reynolds, speaking in Dublin, urged Sinn Fein to respond positively and, in a departure from earlier statements which was intended to maximise the chances of Sinn Fein acceptance, stressed that the declaration was 'essentially an Irish peace initiative'. There could be no renegotiation of the document 'though it may eventually be transcended'. In a reference to London's determination to press on with internal talks, Mr Reynolds stressed that the declaration emphasised 'peace first, negotiations afterwards'. The opposite approach had been tried among the constitutional parties 'with little sign of success so far'. He was non-committal, however, over a timetable for constitutional talks.

After talks in Dublin with Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, Mr Hurd said: 'We need a fair and widely acceptable political agreement . . . which has to cover all three strands of talks that are taking place.' Mr Hurd reinforced recent statements by Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, that there could be no 'internal settlement' in the province and any solution had to take into account the relations between the two governments, their relationships with Northern Ireland, and relationships between the Northern Ireland parties - hence the three 'strands'. The last such talks on Northern Ireland's future administration ended last November without any significant agreement. The Unionist parties - and the Democratic Unionist party in particular - have since laid down a precondition that the Irish government must drop its territorial claim to the province, written in its constitution, before any new talks can begin. Both Mr Hurd and Mr Spring reaffirmed, however, their determination to see the talks resumed. When asked about the controversial move last month by Mr John Hume, leader of the Social Democratic Labour party, to hold talks with Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein leader, at the latter's request, Mr Spring said: 'Our position is that which it has always been, that the government will not enter into talks with the men of violence. If they move away from violence then that opens possibilities for them to enter talks . . . Mr Hume is an experienced politician and I like to think he knows what he is doing.'

0,FT942-17405 ,"FT942-17405 _AN-EDECPACMFT 940405   FT  05 APR 94 / Leading Article: Not much of a ceasefire   The three-day ceasefire announced by the Irish Republican Army and due to start today is not a breakthrough for peace. The British prime minister was right to call it cynical. His Irish counterpart was correct to express dismay at the failure of the terrorists to lay down their arms once and for all. Both Mr John Major and Mr Albert Reynolds have signed a document intimating that all is possible after a genuine declaration of a permanent ceasefire, and nothing before it. This should be definitive. It would be a mistake to heed the siren voice of Mr Gerry Adams, the principal apologist for the IRA, who promises, in a thousand different ways, that if only the British and Irish prime ministers would stand on their heads, a more prolonged cessation of violence might follow. Just meet the IRA, or Sinn Fein, its political wing, says Mr Adams. Such contacts have taken place before, and they can begin again. If, absent a permanent ceasefire, negotiations are ruled out, then let the parties discuss clarification of the Downing Street declaration. If clarification is rejected as a euphemism for negotiation, let there be less well-defined conversations, perhaps between a representative of the British government and one from IRA/Sinn Fein, perhaps for an hour. If not an hour, perhaps for a shorter period. It is easy to see what Sinn Fein is trying to do. The two governments must be shown to have succumbed to the arguments of the terrorist. They must blink first. The proposition that violence pays must lie on the negotiating table, to be used again if the negotiations are not going Sinn Fein's way. The republican case can thus be pressed to its unswerving conclusion, namely the unification of Ireland, with or without the consent of the electorate of its northern province, this being the very point on which no British government can or should budge. Saving face There is another view. It assumes or at least hopes that the IRA is genuinely anxious to make peace and that it requires a meeting to save face. If so, there might be a case for considering Mr Adams' offers. Some respectable participants in Irish affairs argue thus. The 72-hour post-Easter peace represents an ideal opportunity to test Sinn Fein's intentions, proclaims Mr John Hume, leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party. Mr Hume is widely respected for his earnest efforts to bring the IRA and Sinn Fein into negotiations. Call the Adams bluff, he argues persuasively. If a lasting cessation of violence is not thus achieved, then he will ensure Sinn Fein's isolation from democratic politics. Cardinal Cahal Daly, the Catholic primate of all Ireland is another who believes that some within Sinn Fein genuinely desire to end the violence. Derisory offer This argument, sadly, is not supported by the facts. As an earnest of peaceful intent, a three-day break from what its adherents call the armed struggle is, after 25 years of bloodshed, derisory. Had the IRA called a six-month truce, it would be more difficult to dismiss the case for starting low-level official talks on the modalities of negotiating a permanent peace. Mr Hume's pleas are sounding more desperate. Cardinal Daly acknowledged in his Easter message that most people are deeply disappointed that the ceasefire will last for such a short time. 'The credibility of the Sinn Fein commitment to peace is steadily ebbing away,' he said. The Irish government appears to concur. The British government is in a more awkward position. The prime minister is under challenge within his own party. If he stands by the joint declaration and dismisses the arguments for talks with Sinn Fein he will be accused of trying to show his strength of purpose over Ulster this week, having failed to do so over the European community last week. This is a burden Mr Major must bear. He knows it would be wrong to succumb to Mr Adams' temptations. He must also be aware that to do so would be taken by his party as overwhelming evidence of weakness under pressure. Meanwhile, if Mr Adams genuinely wants something significant to emerge from 72 murder-free hours, he should use the time to publish a clear statement of what his organisation means when it demands clarification of the Anglo-Irish declaration.

0,FT934-1990 ,"FT934-1990 _AN-DLPC5AB8FT 931216   FT  16 DEC 93 / The Joint Statement: Reynolds basks in unusual glory of cross-party support      By TIM COONE   After weeks of criticism from the opposition benches in the Irish parliament over his approach to the Anglo-Irish peace initiative, Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, yesterday basked in an unusual display of cross-party support. The three main opposition parties, Fine Gael, the Progressive Democrats and Democratic Left, have been concerned that Mr Reynolds, in pushing hard for an accommodation of nationalist aspirations in the joint declaration, would alienate unionist opinion in Northern Ireland and exacerbate political tensions and violence there. Ms Mary Harney, leader of the Progressive Democrats who has been one of Mr Reynolds' sharpest critics, described the declaration as 'fair and balanced'. She added: 'Over the past number of weeks I and my party consistently expressed our concerns that a peace formula might be attempted to satisfy the men of violence at the expense of constitutional unionists in particular. I am happy to acknowledge that my concerns have not come to pass.' Mr John Bruton, the Fine Gael leader, congratulated the two prime ministers in reaching an agreement. Highlighting the British government's acknowledgement of the right to self-determination in the island of Ireland, he said: 'In view of this declaration, there can be no conceivable justification for any organisation, like the IRA, to continue to attempt to coerce the British people by arms into agreeing to something that they have already plainly agreed to in this declaration.' He was concerned at a 'lack of clear timetables or mechanisms' for the resumption of inter-party talks and hoped that the formula for dropping the republic's constitutional claim to Northern Ireland in the context of an overall settlement 'would not be used as an excuse to defer all action on constitutional reforms into the indeterminate future'. Mr Prionsias de Rossa, leader of Democratic Left which in an earlier guise was the political wing of the official IRA before the organisation split in the 1970s, paid tribute 'to the drafting skills of some of the best brains in both the Irish and British public services'. He said the British government 'has gone as far as it is politically possible to go to meet republican demands in regard to self-determination'. He added: 'If the IRA spurns this opportunity, responsibility for the continuing violence will be seen to rest totally with them.' Mr de Rossa also said that Mr Reynolds 'has gone further than he or any of his predecessors have been prepared to go in the past' by making a solemn written commitment to drop the republic's constitutional claim to Northern Ireland as part of an overall political settlement. Mr Bruton warned against establishing too many bodies for discussing issues in the north. On the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, he said there should not be 'competing institutions trying to solve the same problem - creating needless misunderstandings and misinterpretations'.

0,FT941-9477 ,"FT941-9477 _AN-EBODHABYFT 940215   FT  15 FEB 94 / Mayhew maintains diplomatic efforts to find Ulster peace      By MICHAEL CASSELL, TIM COONE and DAVID OWEN      BELFAST, DUBLIN, LONDON   Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, yesterday employed further delicate diplomacy to maintain British government efforts aimed at encouraging all sides to embrace the peace process in Northern Ireland. In an article published in yesterday's Irish Times, Sir Patrick used new and more straightforward language to address some of the concerns and uncertainties arising from the Downing Street declaration and to offer a more detailed vision of what could lie beyond a permanent end to violence. His message came as it emerged at Westminster that Sir Patrick has given the hardline Democratic Unionist party a virtual assurance that the Anglo-Irish conference will not meet while political talks are taking place. Mr Peter Robinson, the DUP deputy leader, said a letter recently received from the Northern Ireland secretary indicated 'a willingness to suspend' the conference. The DUP - which is boycotting the talks process - last week wrote to Mr John Major requesting a meeting before the prime minister's next encounter with Mr Albert Reynolds, his Irish counterpart, on Saturday. According to Mr Robinson, Sir Patrick also stressed that there was no requirement for the DUP to accept the joint declaration as the basis for political talks. In yesterday's article, Sir Patrick forcefully reiterated the government's insistence that the IRA must end hostilities and that Sinn Fein must renounce the justification of violence and commit itself exclusively to the democratic process. But he also attempted to edge forward on some areas cited by republicans as being in need of clarification. His remarks were welcomed by Mr Reynolds. Sir Patrick repeated his view that, in the event of an end to IRA violence, Sinn Fein could be admitted to exploratory talks 'within three months' rather than at the end of a three-month quarantine period. He said that once it was clear that all terrorist violence had ceased for good, the benefits to the community would include 'our ability to manage without troops being deployed in support of the police and without emergency legislation'. Sir Patrick said Britain 'cannot and will not adopt the role of persuader for any particular outcome' and that 'with or without' Sinn Fein, the process would go ahead. He added: 'We are, however, persuaders who urge the really committed to search for widely-based agreement.' In a passage intended to assure nationalists, Sir Patrick said he wanted to see 'substantial devolved powers' in Northern Ireland but he emphasised that this would not be done on a unilateral basis but through agreement within the so-called 'three- stranded' talks process which includes the Irish government. 'We cannot revert to a system of government in Northern Ireland with which only one part of the community can readily identify.' In Ulster, local politicians yesterday voiced alarm over the rise in attacks by loyalist paramilitaries. Mr Seamus Mallon, deputy leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party, said members of his party were increasingly being singled out as terrorist targets.

0,FT943-6019 ,"FT943-6019 _AN-EIAD1ABQFT 940901   FT  01 SEP 94 / The IRA Ceasefire: Unionists divided in degrees of scepticism      By TIM COONE and DAVID OWEN   The response by Northern Ireland's unionists to the IRA ceasefire will be crucial in determining how far the two governments can respond to it, consolidating it into what Dublin already believes is a permanent ceasefire. Initial unionist reactions have been ambivalent and sceptical. Mr Jim Wilson, general secretary of the Ulster Unionist party, said the IRA ceasefire did not meet the conditions of the Downing Street declaration and 'should not therefore trigger the process in which Sinn Fein could enter into exploratory talks with the British government'. Sitting across the negotiating table from Sinn Fein is 'way, way down the road', he said. If there is a permanent end to IRA violence though, and after exploratory talks between Sinn Fein and the British government, 'as a democratic party we would envisage a situation in which we would talk to other democratically elected parties'. Mr James Molyneaux, leader of the UUP, emerged from an hour-long meeting with prime minister John Major at Downing Street to say that he did not think the IRA's statement was sufficient to start the clock ticking in the lead-up to talks between London and Sinn Fein. 'I hope those who have influence with Sinn Fein/IRA will be able to take the next step and make it permanent,' Mr Molyneaux said. In a message to loyalist paramilitaries, Mr Molyneaux said there was 'no justification or excuse for violence on the part of anyone.' The hardline Democratic Unionist party has been predictably apocalyptic in its response. Mr Ian Paisley, the DUP leader, was earlier this week warning of a 'civil war' if the IRA ceasefire involved a deal with the British government. Mr Gregory Campbell, a DUP councillor from Derry, said: 'The IRA is replacing violence as a means of achieving its aims, with the threat of violence. Does anybody believe there has been no deal? We await with great interest what the British government has agreed to do in return.' The DUP remains steadfastly opposed to talks with Sinn Fein at any stage in the peace process, and has refused to enter round-table talks even with the other parties in the province unless the Downing Street declaration is rescinded. With the prospect of inclusive round-table talks still some way off, of immediate concern for the politicians and the security forces in Northern Ireland is whether there will be a backlash from the loyalist paramilitaries which could undermine the IRA ceasefire. The Combined Loyalist Military Command, the umbrella group for the two main protestant paramilitary groups, the UVF and the UFF, appears to be waiting to see what happens. In a statement yesterday it said: 'We will not be dancing to the Pan-nationalist tune,' and added: 'Is our constitution being tampered with or is it not? What deals have been done? End the speculation. No further comment will be forthcoming from the Combined Loyalist Military Command at present.' Perhaps the most encouraging signal that loyalist reaction may be restrained has come from Mr Hugh Smyth, Belfast's Lord Mayor, who is a member of the Progressive Unionist party, whose political base is in the loyalist Shankill Road area in Belfast and is considered close to the Ulster Volunteer Force. He welcomed yesterday's 'opportunity for peace' and urged the people of Northern Ireland to 'grasp this opportunity because history will not treat us kindly if we throw this opportunity away, providing that there is no sell-out. I believe we should all work now for peace, stability and political progress through reconciliation.' He described Republican aspirations for a united Ireland as 'legitimate' as long as they are not pursued by violent means. The key issue facing unionist leaders in the weeks ahead, therefore, will be whether they can bury their differences to confront what is now likely to emerge as a powerful nationalist alliance with agreed negotiating goals, between the mainly Catholic SDLP and Sinn Fein in Northern Ireland, backed by Fianna Fail and Labour in the government in the Republic. Failure to do so may well see a further erosion of unionist aspirations.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.     IEZ  Ireland, EC.   Industries:-  P9721 International Affairs.

The rejection by a Sinn Fein national delegate conference appeared to confirm the London government's view that Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein's president, cannot persuade IRA hard-liners to call a cessation of violence. Amid anger and disappointment in London, British officials made clear that until there was a renunciation of violence there was no question of involving Sinn Fein in talks aimed at establishing a new political settlement in Northern Ireland. Mr John Major and Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, hope to produce in September a framework document for such a settlement. Officials were dismissive of Sinn Fein's demand that the London and Dublin governments move further to 'clarify' the Downing Street declaration by diluting the veto of the unionists in Ulster over constitutional change. Mr Reynolds warned the response would mean continued terrorist violence. But he added: 'Some positive signals have emanated from the convention. The reservations expressed about the Downing Street declaration come as no real surprise at this stage. What is essential now is that all paramilitary organisations should stop the killing.' In its first formal response to the declaration, Sinn Fein described it as inadequate, but said that it would work to overcome the obstacles. It said the declaration was a 'step in the peace process' but did not 'deal adequately with some of the core issues and this is crucial'. Speaking last night at the delegate conference, called to approve the governing executive's response to the declaration, Mr Adams said Sinn Fein had 'recommitted itself today to constructing this foundation, by building on the positive elements of the Downing Street declaration and by seeking to overcome the difficulties'. However, Mr Adams stopped far short of calling on the IRA to end its campaign of violence, ending hopes that Sinn Fein would be able to take part in cross party talks that the UK and Irish governments hope will start this autumn. The Downing Street declaration offered a place at the negotiating table to Sinn Fein if it formally and permanently renounced violence. Ahead of the conference, held amid tight security in the border town of Letterkenny in the Republic of Ireland, there had been growing optimism that it would decide to call on the IRA to announce a summer ceasefire. But Mr Adams said yesterday the IRA would make its own decision on a ceasefire. Sinn Fein listed 10 aspects of the Downing Street declaration about which it was unhappy, including the so-called unionist veto over any changes in the constitutional status of Northern Ireland. Mr David Winnick, the Labour vice-chairman of the Anglo-Irish parliamentary association said he was 'bitterly disappointed' by Sinn Fein's response.

0,FT934-4528 ,"FT934-4528 _AN-DLCDFACVFT 931203   FT  03 DEC 93 / Sinn Fein says cabinet was split on Ulster      By JIMMY BURNS and JAMES BLITZ   Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, said yesterday that it had received highly sensitive information earlier this year about a split in the British government over its negotiations with the organisation. Mr Martin McGuinness, the Sinn Fein official with the closest links to the IRA, said he had been informed earlier this year that Mr John Major was forced to defuse a cabinet split over government contacts with nationalists. According to Mr McGuinness, Mr Major met Sir Patrick Mayhew, Ulster secretary, Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, and two civil servants on May 17 to discuss an IRA offer to call a 14-day ceasefire to enable talks to take place. The next day the group was expanded to include Mr Kenneth Clarke, then home secretary. Mr McGuinness claimed that Mr Clarke expressed concern that continuing dialogue with Sinn Fein was 'too risky with the government under siege'  - a possible reference to government difficulties ratifying the Maastricht treaty. By contrast, said Mr McGuinness, Sir Patrick was 'wobbling between pushing for acceptance and wanting a safer, longer period of cessation'. Downing Street last night reacted angrily to Mr McGuinness's claims about the meetings, saying that they were 'inaccurate'. It added that 'all the quotes are fabricated'. The claims, it said, were an attempt to distract attention from the fact that Sinn Fein had made the original overtures to Britain this year. However, the revelations looked set to further embarrass the government on the eve of peace talks between Mr Major and Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister. Sinn Fein further disconcerted the government by saying that it had also received copies of a briefing paper from the Northern Ireland Office which summarised talks conducted between Ulster's democratic parties last year under Sir Ninian Stephens, an Australian judge. According to the briefing paper, the British were exploring the possibility of setting up a power sharing assembly in Stormont, creating a series of cross-border executive agencies and agreeing a constitutional declaration on Ulster. The document showed that Sir Ninian had conducted the talks with constitutional parties between May and November last year. If this allegation is proved, it would give strength to claims that the British government has been involved in talks with the Irish nationalists for more than three years. British officials claimed earlier this week that Sinn Fein made initial enquiries about talks with the government in February.   Countries:-  IEZ  Ireland, EC.     GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

0,FT944-4253 ,"FT944-4253 _AN-ELIDCAB7FT 941209   FT  09 DEC 94 / Talks with loyalists start next Thursday      By DAVID OWEN, JIMMY BURNS, STEWART DALBY and KEVIN BROWN   The government is to start talks with loyalist representatives next Thursday  -a year after the signing of the Downing Street declaration. The announcement by Mr John Major came on the eve of historic talks in Belfast between a government team led by Mr Quentin Thomas, number two in the Northern Ireland Office, and Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing. The government is keeping open the option of upgrading the talks to ministerial level at a later date. It is hoped the dialogue will pave the way for both Sinn Fein and loyalist representatives to join talks involving Northern Ireland's main constitutional parties. Yesterday's developments came amid mounting signs of a rapprochement between the government and the Rev Ian Paisley's hardline Democratic Unionist party. A meeting on Tuesday between Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, and a DUP delegation led by Mr Paisley is understood to have been viewed as helpful by both sides. Separately, Mr Ron Brown, US Commerce Secretary, yesterday spoke out in favour of the decision to invite some members of Sinn Fein to next week's Belfast investment conference which is to be hosted by Mr Major. Mr Brown, who is leading a US delegation to the conference, said he could not conceive of 'a scenario that would bring peace and tranquility to Northern Ireland that does not include Sinn Fein'. Sinn Fein has not yet said whether it will attend the conference. It is pushing for a more elevated representation in the form of Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president. Mr Brown, dismissing the notion that there had been a poor response from US business leaders, said there were no plans for the US to make a public-sector contribution to infrastructure projects in the province. Top of the government's agenda in talks with both Sinn Fein and loyalists will be the decommissioning of paramilitary arsenals, which is seen as the key to the two sides' participation in future political talks. The prospects of making progress on this issue may have been complicated by the power vacuum in Dublin, however. It is understood that before the political crisis IRA leaders indicated to the Irish government that they would be willing to identify some arms caches in the south in return for British concessions on troop levels and IRA prisoners.

0,FT941-7085 ,"FT941-7085 _AN-EB0AFABWFT 940226   FT  26 FEB 94 / Sinn Fein wants talks link renewed      By TIM COONE and DAVID OWEN   Sinn Fein leaders are to insist at the party's annual conference in Dublin this weekend that a direct channel of communication with the British government must be reopened if the Northern Ireland peace process is to move forward. Mr Gerry Adams is today expected to use a keynote speech to refer to 'positive aspects' of the Downing Street declaration but to stop short of giving the document his approval. The Sinn Fein president will focus on what he sees as the declaration's shortcomings on the issue of Irish self-determination. But as republican leaders responded favourably to this week's efforts by London and Dublin to address nationalist concerns about their joint initiative, Anglo-Irish tensions were heightened by an Irish High Court decision to free a terrorist suspect wanted for questioning over the murder of a soldier. Mr Joseph Magee, 27, from Armagh, was released after Mr Justice Feargus Flood ruled that the alleged offence of killing a soldier in Derby was a political one for which he could not be extradited. Meanwhile, mounting unionist hostility towards the direction of the initiative was underlined when Mr John Taylor, a senior Ulster Unionist MP, urged his party leadership to boycott new political talks. The IRA's political wing yesterday reacted positively to an article published in the Irish News, the Belfast-based nationalist newspaper, in which Mr John Major, the prime minister, made an eve-of-conference appeal to republican leaders to embrace the peace process. Mr Mitchel McLoughlin, Sinn Fein's Northern Ireland chairman, said Mr Major's statement deserved 'very, very careful study'. He said the article - along with a number of recent speeches by senior ministers - had been 'of assistance'. Mr McLoughlin said an offer of a temporary IRA ceasefire made last year during the secret negotiations between the British government and Sinn Fein was 'still on the table'. Mr Major emphasised in the article that the joint declaration left 'no conceivable reason for continued violence' and that London would not 'try to persuade people to go for Irish unity'. But he combined this uncompromising message with a vision of the possible outcome of political talks designed to reassure nationalists. After yesterday's Irish High Court decision Mr Michael Mates, the former Northern Ireland minister, said the case was 'another example of what we have been complaining about to the Irish for a long time. Their extradition laws are flawed. They have acknowledged they are flawed.'   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.     IEZ  Ireland, EC.   Industries:-  P9721 International Affairs.

0,FT943-5532 ,"FT943-5532 _AN-EIDAYAA6FT 940903   FT  03 SEP 94 / Pro-unionist MPs flex their muscles: Tory right      By DAVID OWEN   For the moment they are mainly content to keep a watchful and suspicious eye on the progress of the UK-Irish peace initiative. But if events turn sour - as many of them fear they will - their misgivings could burst damagingly into the open. The large pro-unionist contingent in Conservative ranks will continue to exert a strong influence over Mr John Major in the aftermath of this week's open-ended IRA ceasefire. The need to ensure their tacit acceptance of the direction of government policy will be among the main factors shaping the prime minister's words and deeds in coming weeks. One area in which the views of the pro-unionist grouping could quickly influence the government's strategy is the vexed issue of whether the IRA ceasefire is permanent. Mr Jim Cran, Tory MP for Beverley, yesterday urged the government to take a hard line, saying ministers should insist that Sinn Fein uses the phrase 'a permanent renunciation of violence' in its amplifications of the IRA statement. 'All we have . . . is a sort of armistice,' Mr Cran added. In practice most Conservatives would probably fall into line once Mr James Molyneaux, the Ulster Unionist party leader, let it be known that he was satisfied that the cessation of IRA violence was for good. Many pro-unionists still hold profound reservations about the prospect of government officials holding bilateral talks with Sinn Fein representatives. Earlier this week Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, said in a pamphlet written before the ceasefire that the country 'should be spared the sight of ministers of the Crown or their representatives sitting around the same table as men who until three months before were bombing our fellow countrymen'. Mr Lamont is expected to return to the subject of Ulster in a newspaper article this weekend. Ms Lisl Biggs-Davison, trustee of the Friends of the Union under whose imprimatur Mr Lamont's pamphlet appeared, said she would be 'terribly reluctant' for the government to talk with Sinn Fein. 'I want to know what will happen to the people who have carried out those terrible crimes,' she said. If pro-unionists do decide to make public their reservations about the course of events, next month's Conservative party conference will provide the perfect opportunity. Not only is there a debate on Northern Ireland, but a series of events is planned on the conference fringe. One pro-unionist said this week that Northern Ireland was destined to be 'the big issue in Bournemouth'. The expectation among most Tories is that unless the peace initiative goes badly off the rails Mr Major and Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, are set to be applauded to the rafters for trying to end the violence. But the strength of the Tory pro-unionist faction should not be underestimated. The backbench Northern Ireland committee is firmly in pro-unionist hands, under the low-key but effective chairmanship of Mr Andrew Hunter, the MP for Basingstoke. Its influence in cabinet has also increased markedly with the promotion of Viscount Cranborne, leader of the Lords, and Mr Jonathan Aitken, chief Treasury secretary, in the recent reshuffle.

0,FT934-2053 ,"FT934-2053 _AN-DLPC5AAGFT 931216   FT  16 DEC 93 / Anglo-Irish plan offers hope for peace in Ulster: Hardline unionists condemn initiative as Sinn Fein expresses disappointment      By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor   The boldest Anglo-Irish political initiative during 25 years of violence in Northern Ireland was launched yesterday with a plea to the IRA to grasp the opportunity for peace. But praise for the Downing Street Declaration from across the political spectrum was matched by initial 'disappointment' from Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, and condemnation from hardline unionists. In a joint statement establishing the framework for a permanent political settlement, Mr John Major and Mr Albert Reynolds heralded an historic opportunity for 'a new beginning' in the province. The prime ministers pledged to accelerate all-party talks designed to restore devolved government to Northern Ireland province and to intensify co-operation between Belfast and Dublin. Mr Major invited Sinn Fein to join the talks process within three months of an end to violence. Speaking at a joint press conference with Mr Reynolds, he said the declaration 'closes no doors except the door to violence and illegality. And crucially it opens the door to those who abandon violence'. Speaking directly to the IRA, Mr Reynolds added: 'This offers you an historic opportunity to come into the political process.' He said Dublin would establish an all-Ireland Forum to which Sinn Fein would be invited after a cessation of terrorism. In a television broadcast across the UK last night, Mr Major said: 'We cannot go on spilling blood in the name of the past . . . the time to choose peace is long overdue.' Aides of both leaders were privately voicing hopes that the IRA's traditional Christmas ceasefire, due to start shortly, could turn into a permanent cessation of violence. But Mr Major and Mr Reynolds admitted that while they hoped for peace, the initiative now lay with the IRA. The declaration, entrenching the unionist veto over constitutional change in Northern Ireland but balancing it with explicit recognition of the possibility of a united Ireland, won grudging acquiescence from the Ulster Unionists. Mr James Molyneaux, Ulster Unionist leader, asked a series of pointed questions about the statement but refrained from open criticism. Later, he said there were parts of the declaration the UUP did not accept. But the party had set its reservations aside 'for the time being' to see what effect the document had on the IRA. The initiative was praised by Mr John Hume, the leader of the mainly Catholic SDLP. Mr Hume said that he intended to resume his talks with Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, in an attempt to encourage a total cessation of violence. But Mr Ian Paisley, leader of the hardline Democratic Unionists, condemned the agreement as a 'sell-out' to the IRA and an 'act of treachery' by Mr Major. In Sinn Fein's first reaction, a leading member said there was general 'disappointment' among nationalists, but Mr Mitchel McLaughlin, the party chairman, said it would be studying the joint declaration in depth. In the House of Commons, Mr Major won plaudits from opposition leaders and Conservative MPs alike for what was variously described as a 'brave' and 'imaginative' initiative. In an attempt to maintain the support of the Ulster Unionists, the prime minister insisted repeatedly that the province's status would be changed only with the consent of a majority of its citizens. He said the declaration 'guarantees that for so long as a majority of the people of Northern Ireland wish to remain a part of the UK, the government will uphold their right to do so. That pledge remains 'rock-solid'. But in the hope of coaxing Sinn Fein to the negotiating table, Mr Major ceded significant ground to Mr Reynolds in agreeing language designed to appeal to Irish nationalists. The declaration makes clear that the British government will do nothing to stand in the way of Irish unity and will consider the establishment of cross-border institutions to strengthen cross-border links. Adapting nationalist rhetoric, it said that the people of Ireland alone should map out their own future through 'self-determination on the basis of consent, freely and concurrently given, north and south'. Mr Reynolds moved further than previous Irish leaders in offering explicit recognition that the status of Northern Ireland could only be changed with the consent of its people. He told journalists in Downing Street: 'We cannot have winners and losers if we want peace.' Mr Reynolds, who won a standing ovation in the Dail after returning to Dublin last night, also gave a commitment that the Irish government would drop its constitutional claim to Northern Ireland as part of an overall political settlement.

0,FT943-3475 ,"FT943-3475 _AN-EINDHAB5FT 940914   FT  14 SEP 94 / Irish government moves to maintain impetus on peace      By JOHN MURRAY BROWN   The Irish government yesterday moved to maintain the momentum behind the peace process after Monday's loyalist bomb attack in central Dublin and as violence broke out yesterday in north Belfast, John Murray Brown writes. Senior Dublin civil servants opened talks with Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, in preparation for the all-party Forum for Peace and Reconciliation which the republic hopes to convene before the end of October. Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, has pushed for an early convening of the forum to commit Sinn Fein to the democratic process, bolstering the moderates at the expense of hardliners after the IRA's announcement of a cessation of hostilities. Although Mr Reynolds has repeated his wish that unionist parties will join the forum, both leading parties - the Official Ulster Unionists and the Democratic Unionists - seem likely to decline. Unionist officials are resentful about what they see as Dublin's attempt to steamroll the process. Mr John Taylor, Ulster Unionist MP for Strangford, last night said unionists should prepare for 'political battle' when the British and Irish governments publish their framework document - which is expected next month - laying out proposals for political progress. Meanwhile, in north Belfast, vehicles were hijacked and shots fired after violent clashes in the city's crown court. The trial of a Roman Catholic man accused of the attempted murder of loyalist Mr Johnny Adair had to be adjourned after fighting between supporters of the two men. Police moved a crowd of 40 loyalists into the Crumlin Road. Trouble then spread to the nearby Protestant Shankill Road and continued sporadically into the night. In a separate incident last night, a Protestant man was shot in the leg on the northern outskirts of Belfast.   Countries:-  IEZ  Ireland, EC.     GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

He told MPs that he knew nothing of what had been agreed by the two nationalist leaders. The prime minister also delivered a scarcely veiled rebuke to Mr Albert Reynolds. He said the Irish premier's announcement that he was to have talks on the initiative with Mr Major in Brussels next week was 'uncleared with me'. If Mr Reynolds wished to raise matters that he believed would bring violence to an end in Northern Ireland, 'then I am compelled to listen', Mr Major said. He emphasised again his government's refusal to negotiate with terrorists. 'We do not negotiate with people who deal with bullet and bomb and we do not surrender to their violence either now or in the future,' he said in comments which brought cheers from the Ulster Unionist party benches. His remarks came just two days after Mr James Molyneaux, the Ulster Unionist leader, dismissed the Hume-Adams initiative as 'sheer lunacy'. Mr Major is under pressure to take account of the Ulster Unionist position because of the precariousness of his 17-strong Westminster majority. His meeting with Mr Reynolds is expected to take place two days after the next scheduled meeting of the Anglo-Irish conference in Belfast next Wednesday. Mr Major's comments came as the Institute for Public Policy Research, the left-of-centre think-tank, published a plan for a new constitution for the province in which sovereignty would be shared by its people and the British and Irish governments. Mr Kevin McNamara, Labour's Northern Ireland spokesman, said the IPPR model deserved 'considered examination' but the party had no plans to change its policy of unity only by consent.

Amid continuing uncertainty over whether the two men arrested after the armed raid in Newry were active IRA members, Sir Patrick said: 'The peace process is on course and I hope it stays on course.' Talks would happen, though, only if IRA violence was 'shown to be permanently at an end'. He said: 'If this miserable and wicked episode . . . shows anything at all, it shows the evil use to which illegally held arms are put, and that has got to be dealt with straight away.' Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, insisted yesterday that the 10-week-old Ulster ceasefire remained intact. Mr Pat Doherty, Sinn Fein vice-president, said the shooting of Mr Frank Kerr, 53, was wrong. But he did not know whether the IRA had been involved. He added: 'Any military operation of any nature should not be carried out during this ceasefire. That is the commitment that the IRA has given - and I am convinced that is the commitment they are prepared to stand over.' As the Royal Ulster Constabulary appealed for information on another man believed to have taken part in the attack, Mr Ken Maginnis, Ulster Unionist security spokesman, said he thought four people were involved. He said three had served prison sentences for terrorist offences. 'It will be interesting to see what, if any, action the IRA intends to take against the third and fourth members of the gang who escaped.' As the Irish government joined London in emphasising the importance of keeping the peace process on course, it emerged that Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, will fly to London next week. It will be his first to mainland Britain since a ban on him was lifted last month. The Irish government is likely to seek further meetings with Sinn Fein over the next couple of days. With the need to dismantle paramilitary arsenals now firmly at the top of the two governments' agenda, the issue is expected to feature prominently when Sir Patrick Mayhew meets Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, in Dublin on Monday. Mr Spring denied that the Irish government had acted too quickly in drawing up plans to release nine IRA prisoners.

His comments drew immediate criticism from the UK government, unionist MPs and politicians in the republic. Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, expressed surprise that Mr Reynolds should breach the confidentiality of the negotiations and said it would 'make things difficult for both sides'. Mr Reynolds, interviewed on BBC Radio at the weekend, said London had agreed that Dublin should have a role in future all-Ireland institutions covering areas such as tourism and transport - a move northern unionists believe is a step towards a united Ireland. The former Irish prime minister, forced to resign over a judicial appointment scandal last month, said an all-Ireland body would have executive powers and be drawn from representatives in Dublin and a future parliament in Northern Ireland. Mr Reynolds also said substantive talks involving British ministers and Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, should begin now and troops should be taken off the streets. He said Downing Street's precondition that weapons be handed in or destroyed could seriously threaten the ceasefire. According to Mr Reynolds the all-Ireland body is among proposals in a new framework document which London and Dublin hope will form the basis for all-party talks on the province's future. The document is due to be published early next year and is expected to be discussed when Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, meets Mr John Bruton, the republic's new prime minister, in London next week. Mr Reynolds's comments are widely seen as a bid to sour Mr Bruton's relations with the unionists and demonstrate to nationalists that it was the outgoing Fianna Fail led coalition that had secured concessions on cross-border bodies. Mr Ken Maginnis, Ulster Unionist MP, accused Mr Reynolds of 'destructive dialogue' and seeking to weave a web of suspicion by giving the IRA the impression that an 'embryo united Ireland' was within reach. Mr Peter Robinson, East Belfast MP for the hardline Democratic Unionists, called on Mr Major to provide 'the clearest clarification' of the state of negotiations, warning the government that it was 'heading for confrontation' with the unionist community in Northern Ireland. British officials and Sinn Fein will meet for more exploratory dialogue at Stormont today when the issue of guns and explosives is likely to be raised again.   Countries:-  IEZ  Ireland, EC.

His comments came as it emerged at Westminster that the government is unlikely to insist that all IRA weapons are surrendered in exchange for allowing Sinn Fein to join political talks on Northern Ireland's future. Hopes of further progress on the UK-Irish peace initiative were reinforced by the upbeat tone adopted by the British and Irish governments after the first meeting under the terms of the Anglo-Irish conference since last month's IRA ceasefire. Mr Dick Spring, Irish foreign minister, said after his talks with Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, in London that the two governments were coming closer in their attitude to the ceasefire. He hoped the two sides would have completed their work on the framework document designed to inject momentum into political talks involving the province's main political parties 'long before' Christmas. Questioned on the prospects for talks between the government and Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, Mr Major noted that republican leaders had still not provided sufficient assurances that the IRA had renounced violence for good. But if the assurances demanded by the government were given without delay, 'clearly we could be talking at or around Christmas-time', he said. Yesterday's developments came on the eve of the arrival in Boston of Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president. London has promised to start preliminary talks on how to admit Sinn Fein to the political process within three months of a permanent end to IRA violence. The ground covered would include what to do about the IRA's extensive armoury. Anything short of a full surrender of IRA weapons would probably disappoint unionists, many of whom remain profoundly suspicious of the IRA's intentions. According to Whitehall officials, London is unlikely to regard a refusal by republican leaders to guarantee that all IRA weapons have been handed in as a potential deal-breaker. There is widespread acceptance, however, that London is likely to take a much tougher line over caches of explosives and military equipment such as semi-automatic rifles and rocket launchers. That is the minimum that would be demanded by the moderate unionists whom it is vital for London to keep on board. According to Mr John Taylor, the Ulster Unionist MP for Strangford, there is 'no way in which the UUP could recognise Sinn Fein as a normal democratic political party . . . until those guns are accounted for'. Questioned on the issue yesterday, Sir Patrick Mayhew said nobody who had given up violence had 'any possible need for these things'.

We have had plenty of words, but it is not words people  want.  The huge numbers of people in the north and south of Ireland, in  the United Kingdom, the United States and elsewhere, who support  the Joint Declaration, want an end to violence.

Professions do not sit well with bombs and bullets.    Albert Reynolds and I are at one in seeking peace in  Northern  Ireland. That was why we negotiated the Joint Declaration.

If there is genuine doubt about anything  it says, the text itself can dispel that doubt. We shall not  open back-door negotiations by glossing or shading the  Declaration's language and meaning.    Let me repeat what it says about self-determination, because  this has been misrepresented.    First the British government has no...""selfish, strategic or  economic interest in Northern Ireland.""    That doesn't mean that we don't care about it, nor that we  don't share the interest of its people in a secure, prosperous  and peaceful future.    It does mean that we would have no reason to wish to  frustrate the democratically expressed wishes of the people. We  shall abide by these wishes, and if the people prefer to remain  in the United Kingdom, as they have done so far, we shall uphold  their right to do so.    Second, our primary interest is to see peace, stability and  reconciliation established by agreement among all the people who  inhabit the Island. We will work with the constitutional  parties and Irish government to achieve such an agreement, which  may, as of right, take the form of agreed structures for the  island as a whole, including a united Ireland achieved by  peaceful means. But, again, I emphasise this must be by consent  not imposition.    The way such agreement is to be achieved is set out clearly.    We say that ""it is for the people of the island of Ireland  alone, by agreement between the two parts respectively, to  exercise their right of self-determination on the basis of  consent, freely and concurrently given, north and south, to  bring about a united Ireland, if that is their wish.""    Third, we will ""introduce the necessary legislation to give  effect to this, or equally to any measure of agreement on future  relationships in Ireland which the people living in Ireland may  themselves freely so determine without external impediment.""    In short, democracy will prevail. No other route is  possible.    The Joint Declaration leaves no conceivable reason for  continued violence. The reasons given by the republican  movement in the past no longer exist. That is not just my view.  It is the view which has been expressed by the most respected  leaders of the nationalist community, including of course, John  Hume.    Does Mr Adams share this view? If not, why not? The people  have the right to know. He cannot be permitted to argue for  peace and yet frustrate it.    If Sinn Fein believes in peace, the violence should stop.    Let me be plain on another point. The British government  will, as I said in the Declaration, ""encourage, facilitate and  enable the achievement of such agreement."" We will, however,  not try to persuade people to go for Irish unity. It is not the  government's job to tell the Irish people what they should  think, or to dictate to them where their future should lie.    But what we do advocate is agreement, reached freely and  democratically. I do not believe that the Irish people want the  British government to coerce the greater number in the north  into a united Ireland against their will. Nor does the  Taoiseach [Irish Prime Minister Albert Reynolds]. Albert  Reynolds has publicly opposed such coercion. He has said in the  Joint Declaration that a united Ireland should not be imposed.  We both believe that the people living the island of Ireland,  north and south respectively, should decide. There can be no  coercion.    Before the Declaration was published, there was a lot of  speculation about what it would say. Many confident predictions  were made, most of them wrong.    So I point out, once it was published, all those things it  did not say which people had been led to expect. It did not set  out or require any particular outcome; after all, it is not a  solution. But nor does the Declaration rule anything out,  providing only it is achieved peacefully, by agreement and  consent.    What matters now is what is in the Declaration, and that it  provides a foundation for progress towards a lasting settlement.  What matters is to end the killing. Every death, every injury,  every bereavement is an affront. Over a quarter of a century,  violence has made no headway. But it has caused terrible pain  on both sides of the community. The voices raised against  violence on all sides have grown stronger and more insistent  over the past year. They helped us to produce the Joint  Declaration. They explain the extraordinary level of support  given to it. The overwhelming majority of the people of  Northern Ireland want an end to violence now. Will their voices  be heeded?    Sinn Fein claims not to understand the place of the  Declaration in a ""peace process."" There is nothing obscure  about this either. The Declaration is not a peace plan. It  certainly isn't a solution on its own. It is simply the view of  the two governments about the principles involved in a process  leading to an agreed outcome.    Those central principles are democracy, and an absence of  coercion - in other words consent, no outside interference and  an end to violence.    As a first step, those principles have to be publicly  accepted and acted upon.    We would be ready within three months of an end to violence  to begin an exploratory dialogue with Sinn Fein. Its aims would  be to discuss how Sinn Fein would become involved in the  three-stranded political talks how they could be brought fully  into normal political life in Northern Ireland, and what the  consequence of ending violence would be. They know this is our  intention; we told them of it last November.    I believe this amounts to a substantial exploratory agenda.    Those exploratory discussions would in themselves be part of  the process of bringing Sinn Fein back into normal political  life, in developing a normal political dialogue between the  government and other parties, on matters like education,  housing, healthcare, crime and fair employment.    They could only take place against a background where  violence had no place. As confidence returned, the pracical  consequences of that would be felt across Northern Ireland.    The question of continuing violence is the key. I heartily  endorse the idea that the gun should be taken out of Irish  politics. But who has kept it there? Last year terrorists (not  all of them republican by any means) killed 86 people. The  security forces killed none. If the terrorists discard the gun  for good, we shall in time be able to manage without British  soldiers in support of the RUC and without emergency legislation.    Now as to the political talks. As the Taoiseach and I  declared and I declared last Saturday [19 February]; the talks  process is moving ahead. Sinn Fein are free to come in to  democratic life. They can stay out, if they so decide. But  they can't hold the talks up. It would be wrong of me to  predict their outcome, but certain things are plain.    First, civil rights must and will be carefully protected.  Power must be exercised fairly. We are all resolved on that.    Second, I expect to see institutions and new relationships  reflecting the common interests in the island, as it faces the  challenges of a competitive world and the opportunities of  politial agreement. The character and depth of these is very  much for discussion.    Third, the two governments will be building on the close  partnership we already have as members of the European Union and  as good neighbours in these islands.    Whatever may be the shape of final agreement in the talks,  it  will not be imposed on anyone. It will be the people who will  have decided.    There is no purpose in living in the past. Dreadful deeds  have been done by all sides in past centuries. We should all  regret that, but those of us alive today are not responsible for  them.    Our generation must look to the future. We want to give to  the people power to take the decisions affecting their own  lives. Will Sinn Fein take the opportunity? Will they now  renounce violence, and trust the people? Or will they continue  to inflict on the people further cruel and futile violence?     "

The Irish government has responded with annoyance to an interview with Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, in the Daily Telegraph yesterday in which he emphasised that the republic's territorial claim to the province was the central issue to be resolved in drafting a joint 'framework document' aimed at encouraging Northern Ireland's parties to return to the negotiating table. An Irish government spokesman emphasised that any new constitutional arrangement for the province had to be 'balanced'. He said: 'What we are seeking is a balanced constitutional accommodation as expressed in the (Downing Street) declaration, not some constitutional one-way street.' Last Friday in Brussels Mr John Major and Mr Albert Reynolds, the British and Irish prime ministers, agreed to postpone a planned July summit until the autumn to allow more time for differences to be resolved. The political situation in the province is expected to be high on the agenda, with security, when Mr Major meets Mr James Molyneaux, the Ulster Unionist party leader, and other senior UUP figures in London today. The meeting was portrayed at Westminster last night as the latest in a series of discussions with leaders of the province's main political parties. Mr Major met Mr John Hume, leader of the mainly Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party, last week. A meeting with Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the hardline Democratic Unionist party, is understood to have been pencilled in for July 26. Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, said yesterday that he was 'surprised' at the comments attributed to Sir Patrick and did not agree that the republic's territorial claim was the central issue. He said a 'number of issues remain to be resolved, and all of those will have to be resolved together'. The Irish government has emphasised that the 1920 Government of Ireland Act, the basis of Westminster's rule over Northern Ireland, should be modified as a quid pro quo for modifying the claim. Mr Dermot Ahern, a prominent backbencher of Mr Reynolds' Fianna Fail party and co-chairman of the Anglo-Irish joint parliamentary body, yesterday accused Sir Patrick of trying to 'cherry-pick' aspects of last December's Downing Street declaration.

Both governments united in their condemnation of the attack - which led to calls yesterday for an inquiry into security operations at Heathrow - and insisted that they would not be knocked off course in attempts to reach a political settlement in the province. Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, and Mr Albert Reynolds, his Irish counterpart, claimed that the IRA's latest action and the failure of Sinn Fein to react positively to the Downing Street declaration would not deter London and Dublin from pressing on. At Westminster, Mr Major told MPs the 'unjustifiable' IRA attack would make 'no difference whatsoever' to the search for peace. He emphasised that the declaration set out 'a series of principles upon which we hope and intend to try and build a permanent peace in Northern Ireland'. In the Dail, Mr Reynolds attacked the IRA action as 'criminal and politically naive'. Both London and Dublin privately accept that the political momentum which followed December's declaration has largely been lost. They are now resigned to an extended process aimed at establishing an agreed framework for progress involving the province's constitutional parties. Speaking after yesterday's Anglo-Irish conference in London, Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, said the Heathrow attack had shown the IRA could not make its case via the democratic process and once again had resorted to force. Sir Patrick stressed both governments were committed to continuing the so-called three-stranded political talks process and added: 'There is no limit to our patience because there is no limit to the advantages that success in that process will bring.' He emphasised, however, that the prize of prosperity and peace might lie 'at the end of a very long road but a road on which neither government is going to weary of travelling'. In a speech in London last night, Sir Patrick reinforced the government's 'business as usual' approach by concentrating on the issue of relationships between Northern Ireland and the republic - strand two of the talks process. Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, in one of the most downbeat assessments from Dublin on the chances of an end to IRA action, said that 'the credit is running very low, if not totally expired' on the part of those who had yet to make up their mind on the Downing Street declaration. He said: 'Perhaps they (the IRA) are giving a message to both governments that they are not going to participate.' Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, said that the airport attack was a reminder that the causes of conflict remained. Mr Spring described as 'deplorable' reported remarks by Mr Adams that more 'spectaculars' like Heathrow were to be expected.

The idea was floated in the Downing Street declaration as a way to bring Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, into the peace process following an IRA ceasefire. Opposition parties in the Republic, however, have been pressing the government to establish the forum regardless of the Sinn Fein response to the declaration. During a meeting yesterday between Mr Reynolds and the leaders of the three main opposition parties, Mr Reynolds avoided making any commitment to the creation of the forum without participation from Sinn Fein. However, opposition leaders were satisfied that Mr Reynolds had agreed to more regular consultations with the opposition on the government's Ulster policy.

A State Department spokesman confirmed yesterday that Mr Adams's visa request had been refused under rules that exclude people who have been involved in terrorist activity. Mr Frank McCloskey, a Democratic congressman from Indiana, said he was very disappointed by the decision. 'Generally speaking freedom of access and people is the best route to go,' he said. The refusal coincides with a visit to Washington by Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland Secretary. In a radio interview in the US capital yesterday, Sir Patrick refused to rule out re-starting talks on the political future of Northern Ireland without the Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionist party. 'I would not want to anticipate any particular format,' Sir Patrick said. Mr Paisley says he will not enter talks until the Irish government makes further concessions on its constitutional claim on the six counties. He also wants Mr John Hume, leader of the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour Party, to stop talks with Sinn Fein. Sir Patrick was due to meet attorney-general Janet Reno yesterday, as well as with a number of members of Congress interested in Northern Ireland, including Mr Thomas Foley, Speaker of the House of Representatives. Mr Adams, who has had visa requests refused several times under previous US administrations, had hoped to visit the US for a book promotion tour. Last April, during a hard-fought primary election in New York state, candidate Clinton told a gathering of Irish-Americans that he thought it would be 'totally harmless to our national security and would widen the political debate in this country' to grant a visa to Mr Adams. He added, however, that he would support a visa for Mr Adams 'or any other properly elected government official recognised by the US.' Two days later, Mr Adams lost his seat in the British parliament. Mr Clinton's initial promise to appoint a peace envoy to Ulster has been scaled down since his election to a fact-finding mission, then becoming a 'willingness to send some kind of representative . . if both parties believe it would help move talks forward.'

The Combined Loyalist Military Command (CLMC), in its first response to this week's declaration by the British and Irish prime ministers, made clear the IRA must make the first move. In the absence of any response from the 'Provisional murder gangs', it would pursue its 'stated policy in retaliation to IRA violence'. The loyalist statement came as Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, fleshed out Dublin's proposal for a peace forum to pave the way for an early entry by Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, into dialogue. Mr Reynolds told the Dail (the Irish parliament) that the forum would initially draw together strands of nationalist opinion in both parts of the island. Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, yesterday held out the prospect of lifting Ireland's broadcasting ban on Sinn Fein, if it accepted the peace initiative. The ban comes up for its annual review next month. Mr Spring said: 'I would like to feel we can arrive at a decision which will further promote and enhance the prospects of an open dialogue, in which everyone who accepts a democratic mandate can take part.' Mr Peter Brooke, UK national heritage secretary, is expected to report to Mr John Major on a review of British restrictions on broadcasting direct speech by members of terrorist groups in the province early next year. Downing Street officials sought to underline the degree of cross-party backing in Britain for the peace initiative by praising Thursday night's broadcast by Mr John Smith, the Labour leader. Their comments follow unease on the Tory backbenches over the extent to which they perceive the Downing Street Declaration as diluting the government's commitment to the Union and embracing the nationalist agenda. A further boost for the peace initiative came when Cardinal Cahal Daly, the all-Ireland primate for the Roman Catholic Church, said the declaration gave paramilitaries on both sides an honourable opportunity to halt their violent campaigns. As a poll suggested the people of Ulster were divided over whether the initiative was a first step towards peace, the CLMC said it was seeking clarification on certain aspects of the joint declaration. It would make a 'considered response' later. The CLMC - an umbrella group comprising principally the Ulster Freedom Fighters and the Ulster Volunteer Force - also called for a unionist forum 'to encompass all the loyalist and unionist political parties'. Mr Reynolds said the peace forum would pave the way for wider talks between nationalist and unionist parties together.

As Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, used a speech at the Tory conference in Bournemouth to reassert the party's belief in the Union, ministers acknowledged that talks with Sinn Fein could be under way by Christmas. 'We don't want to drag our feet on this, we are not dawdling at all,' Sir Patrick said, holding out the prospect that loyalist representatives could also be brought into talks. London is considering a scaled-down response to the IRA ceasefire amid acknowledgement by senior ministers that it may never be given an unequivocal pledge that the end to violence is for good. The idea that the government should open a 'reversible' dialogue with Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, will be considered by Mr John Major, the prime minister, and cabinet colleagues next week. Sir Patrick said the loyalist ceasefire made it 'that much harder for the Provisionals to come back to violence and therefore it makes it a good deal easier for us to come to a working assumption'. The ceasefire gave a big push to the peace effort being carefully orchestrated by the UK and Irish governments. Mr Major said the announcement was 'unalloyed good news'. But he warned: 'We must analyse it and consider it and then carefully decide with realism what is the way forward.' Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, was less cautious, describing the development as 'a wonderful moment'. He urged everyone to 'now work together in a spirit of goodwill, reconciliation and forbearance to consolidate a just and lasting peace - to ensure that all of the people of Ireland are rid of the gun and the bomb from Irish politics for ever'. He pressed Mr Major to take the opportunity of his conference speech today to move the process forward. 'We are into the seventh week, and it is time the whole pace of consolidating the peace process was accelerated,' he said. In Bournemouth, Sir Patrick and Mr Major received a warm welcome from conference representatives, in spite of the leadership's decision not to allow a vote on whether the government should actively persuade Ulster's people that their best future lay in the UK. Yesterday's ceasefire move was announced at a press conference by the Combined Loyalist Military Command, representing the two main outlawed protestant paramilitary groups - the Ulster Defence Association and the Ulster Volunteer Force. The loyalists promised a cessation of 'all operational hostilities' from midnight last night. 'The permanence of our ceasefire will be completely dependent upon the continued cessation of all Nationalist and Republican violence,' the statement said. It also emerged that loyalist leaders had contact with the Irish government prior to the ceasefire announcement.

In his first substantial speech of the new year on the initiative, the Irish prime minister insisted that majority consent in Northern Ireland was essential for any peace settlement. But in a passage aimed at Sinn Fein leaders - who have deman-ded clarification of last month's Downing Street declaration be-fore passing judgment on it - Mr Reynolds made it clear he thought the scope of the so-called 'unionist veto' was limited. 'It is important to note that the requirement for the consent of a majority is related . . . to the constitutional issue,' he said. 'It does not mean that all forms of political progress or other decisions by the two governments are subject to a similar block.' Sinn Fein has argued that the veto has been able to block political progress in the past and would continue to do so under the terms of the peace initiative. Mr Reynolds' remarks came as Lord Callaghan, the former Labour prime minister, added his voice to calls for London to provide Sinn Fein with the clarification it has requested. But Lord Callaghan - who, as home secretary, sent the first British troops into Northern Ireland in 1969 - said the government was right not to negotiate with the IRA alone. Separately, Mr James Molyneaux, the Ulster Unionist leader, predicted that talks between Mr Michael Ancram, the Northern Ireland minister, and the province's four constitutional parties could lead to an elected assembly for Ulster by the end of the year. As unionist politicians hardened their rhetoric, Mr Molyneaux predicted that the IRA and Sinn Fein would reject the joint declaration and said Mr John Major, the prime minister, was right not to offer clarification. The document was set out in plain English. He could see no reason why even those of 'limited intelligence' could not understand it. A joint Army and police base at Crossmaglen, South Armagh, was rocked by an explosion early today. Two soldiers were believed to have been injured in the attack.

The incidents appeared to damage seriously any immediate prospect of loyalist paramilitaries ending their campaign of violence. The shootings came as a political row erupted over transfer of four Republican prisoners from the mainland to jails in Northern Ireland only hours after the start of the IRA ceasefire. A 'livid' Mr John Major ordered an urgent inquiry into the decision to move the prisoners, which threatened to put the high-risk UK-Irish peace initiative under renewed pressure by undermining efforts to reassure unionists that no secret deals had been entered into in return for Wednesday's IRA announcement. Meanwhile, the prospect of face-to-face meetings by the end of the year between Sinn Fein and the British government moved closer as London acknowledged that amplifications during the day by republican leaders showed they were 'moving in our direction' over the permanency of the IRA ceasefire. Police said the man who died last night was a 32-year-old unemployed labourer. They confirmed that the victim was a Roman Catholic. In a second incident, a car was fired at in in the Old Park area of north Belfast, and a person claiming to represent the loyalist terror group, the Ulster Freedom Fighters, telephoned BBC Radio Belfast to say they had carried out that shooting. Downing Street said the decision to transfer the prisoners to Northern Ireland had been taken by officials without reference to ministers. But Mr Derek Lewis, director-general of the Prison Service said the decision to transfer a total of 14 prisoners - including the four moved today - was made in June by Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary. He said the timing of the transfers, once the decision had been made, was the responsibility of the prison service and had been determined by 'practical' considerations. Among the prisoners transferred was Mr Patrick Magee, who is serving a life sentence for his involvement in the Brighton bomb which devastated the Grand Hotel during the Conservative conference in 1984. The transfer was immediately attacked by Lord Tebbit, the former Conservative cabinet minister, who was badly injured in the blast. He said it was either 'an early reward for the IRA or crass political incompetence'. As the debate continued over whether the IRA had declared a permanent end to its armed campaign, Downing Street emphasised that the three-month countdown to talks with the IRA's political wing would not begin until the organisation's intentions were 'utterly clear'. But Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, who does not share Downing Street's caution, said the controversy over the omission of the word 'permanent' from the IRA's ceasefire statement was over. He used a state-of-the-nation speech to urge all parties to show imagination and flexibility. Nobody, he said, should diminish the potential of the ceasefire 'by trying to interpret it as anything other than what it is'. His comments followed an article by Mr Gerry Adams in The Irish Times in which the Sinn Fein president said: 'Albert Reynolds, Dick Spring, John Hume and others have responded positively and correctly to the IRA announcement.' In a further republican amplification, Mr Martin McGuinness, a member of Sinn Fein's governing executive, said the organisation was committed to 'a complete cessation of military operations under all circumstances'. Meanwhile, in London, Mr Michael Mates, the former Northern Ireland minister, said he thought the countdown to talks between London and Sinn Fein should begin at once. 'I would think it is not unreasonable for the 90 days to start now,' he said. In Washington, there was little tangible evidence that the US was putting flesh on its promise of support to the peace process. In the past, US president Bill Clinton has expressed interest in a visit to Ireland, and there was some preliminary discussion earlier this year of adding Ireland to his itinerary for one of his two trips to Europe.

Their demand has been repeatedly rejected by London as an attempt to secure further concessions - a stance reiterated by Sir Patrick yesterday afternoon when he told MPs there was no justification for clarifying the joint statement. An apparent stalemate has resulted, with London vowing to intensify political talks with Ulster's constitutional parties, aimed at restoring devolved government to the province. In last night's speech, Sir Patrick balanced a passage offering reassurance to nationalists with a strong affirmation of the unionist veto over any constitutional change in the province's status. In his message to nationalists, Sir Patrick said the government would do 'everything in our power' to facilitate agreement. Emphasising that 'no outcome is ruled out', Sir Patrick said the key was 'agreement between the people living in the island of Ireland, north and south'. He set out the ground that would be covered in exploratory dialogue between London and Sinn Fein that would begin within three months of the IRA renouncing violence, saying: 'That is where clarification could be appropriate.' He told unionists the government would uphold the democratic wish of 'a greater number of the people of Northern Ireland' on whether they prefer to support the union or a sovereign united Ireland. Mr Reynolds sought to clarify Dublin's position on self-determination, saying it was vital that doubts or confusions about the document should be cleared up. He said the island of Ireland and 'not just Northern Ireland' made up 'the framework for self-determination'. There were 'no short cuts' to the need for majority consent to change in Northern Ireland. Those wanting unification 'should persuade those that do not'. The end result of self-determination was not necessarily unification, but rather 'any comprehensive settlement that would constitute an agreed Ireland'. In West Belfast, Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams hinted to party workers that if the right signals flowed from the declaration an IRA ceasefire could not be ruled out. 'There is still the opportunity for peace and Sinn Fein is committed to ensuring the British government does not squander that opportunity,' Mr Adams said.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

0,FT941-2421 ,"FT941-2421 _AN-ECUC0AC4FT 940321   FT  21 MAR 94 / Dublin willing to back a temporary IRA ceasefire      By TIM COONE      DUBLIN   The Irish government sought to breathe fresh life into the Northern Ireland peace process yesterday by indicating that a temporary ceasefire by the IRA would be welcomed in Dublin. Speaking on Irish radio, Mr Dick Spring, the foreign minister, said a temporary ceasefire would be 'a step in the right direction'. The Irish government's decision to encourage a temporary ceasefire contrasts with the previous approach in both London and Dublin of concentrating on the prospects for a permanent cessation of violence. Mr Spring said the Irish government would 'encourage' the IRA to move to a permanent end to violence, and 'would want to build upon' a temporary ceasefire. His comments followed weekend reports of an interview given to New Century, a leftwing British magazine, in which he appeared to suggest that a temporary ceasefire could help to break the deadlock in the peace process. In remarks intended to reassure unionist opinion, Mr Spring said Dublin's view on the timing of talks with the republican movement remained 'very firm'. 'I have to repeat that we will not negotiate with the IRA/Sinn Fein as long as they support violence. If they want to enter the political process, there has to be a permanent cessation of violence and a very firm declaration to that effect,' he said. That formula fits in with the consistent approach by the British government since the publication of the British-Irish Downing Street declaration on Northern Ireland in December. But Dublin's increased willingness to welcome a temporary ceasefire appeared to take the British government by surprise. The Northern Ireland Office was unwilling to endorse Mr Spring's views. Officials would say only that Sinn Fein could enter exploratory talks with the British government within three months of a permanent cessation of violence. In the New Century interview, parts of which were published yesterday in The Observer, Mr Spring appeared to indicate that a temporary ceasefire could be built upon 'without making concessions' to the IRA or Sinn Fein, its political wing. In the interview, given two weeks ago, Mr Spring said the republican movement's strategy appeared to be to offer a temporary cessation of violence 'in order to sit down round the table with other nationalist parties'. He said this would 'pose a bit of a dilemma'. The apparent contradiction in Dublin's position would seem to lie in a semantic distinction being drawn by Dublin between 'talks' and 'negotiations'. An Irish government spokesman was unable to confirm or deny that talks, either directly or indirectly with Sinn Fein - as distinct from negotiations  -could take place after a temporary IRA ceasefire. The IRA admitted yesterday carrying out the attack on Crossmaglen police and army post, which seriously injured a policeman and brought down an army helicopter on Saturday night.

Mr Reynolds' meeting with Mr Adams marked the re-emergence of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, as a mainstream party for the first time since the Irish civil war in the 1920s. The meeting was attended by Mr John Hume, head of the mainly nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party, and in a statement the three leaders said: 'We are at the beginning of a new era in which we are all totally and absolutely committed to democratic and peaceful methods of resolving our political problems.' The meeting was condemned by rightwing Conservative MPs and Unionist leaders, who claimed that Dublin had broken an agreement not to meet Sinn Fein leaders for three months after a permanent ceasefire. However, Mr Major refused to listen to protests from Mr Paisley, the most popular Unionist politician in Northern Ireland, during a meeting at Downing Street. As Mr Paisley attempted to read a prepared statement, Mr Major three times demanded an assurance that the DUP leader would accept his word that no secret deals had been done. When Mr Paisley refused to give such an assurance, Mr Major abruptly ended the meeting. The confrontation followed a meeting of senior British ministers, chaired by Mr Major, which agreed that the government would continue to demand guarantees of a permanent IRA ceasefire before entering talks with Sinn Fein. The government's approach was broadly endorsed by Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader, and Lord Holme, the Liberal Democrat spokesman on Northern Ireland, marking a cross-party rejection of the Irish government's desire for fast progress towards all-party talks. Mr Blair said the government was 'right to be cautious and not to engage in direct negotiations until a proper period has passed so that we can gauge whether the cessation of violence is indeed permanent'. British officials said Mr Reynolds' meeting with Sinn Fein was 'premature'. However, they said the meeting would not interfere with progress towards a framework agreement on the next stage of the Northern Ireland peace process, which the two governments hope to produce before Christmas. The continued caution in London contrasted sharply with the optimistic tone of the Dublin statement, in which the three nationalist leaders said their objective was to build upon the IRA ceasefire announcement last week to achieve 'an equitable and lasting agreement' for Ireland's future. They appealed to Unionists in Northern Ireland to join in talks. Mr Reynolds said Mr Major wanted an assurance 'that it is for real; that it is over'. He said: 'I hope that our statement here today, representing the sense of the meeting, will indeed help him along that road.' He challenged his critics, saying: 'To those people who say 'Why so soon?' my answer has to be - it is never too soon to save a life, and never too soon to stop the killing.' Unionist leaders reacted angrily. Mr David Trimble, Ulster Unionist MP for Upper Bann, said he was 'astonished' the Dublin meeting had taken place. 'Mr Adams has at his back a private army still with thousands of weapons, still with tons of munitions at his disposal,' he said. 'For an Irish prime minister to meet with the leader of a subversive organisation who has got his private army intact is really quite astounding.' Mr Andrew Hunter, chairman of the Conservative backbench Northern Ireland committee, said the meeting was 'a disastrous miscalculation by the Irish government, and potentially it has most damaging consequences'. He said there was 'grave concern that the Irish government is scuppering the process by bending over backwards to appease the IRA'. In Belfast yesterday Republican sources indicated that the IRA had no intention in the medium term of being more specific about the meaning of its ceasefire. 'We have entered an unarmed stage of our struggle for self-determination for the Irish people,' a Republican source said.

In an interview with the Financial Times yesterday, he explained why London, unlike Dublin, does not yet accept IRA bona fides that the violence is permanently over and also what role he hopes the US will play in the peace process. He also hinted at the contents of a forthcoming 'framework document' for round-table talks, being drafted by the British and Irish governments. He said the ceasefire was 'a remarkably important step and a very welcome one'. He added: 'There was no condition attached. There was no finite character to it. Those are very welcome features.' But he said that the 'profound levels of suspicion which are endemic on both sides of the community and very strongly present in the unionist side' made it essential to clarify that the ceasefire was permanent. 'Both governments have insisted that there shall be a permanent end to violence. I don't doubt for a minute the sincerity with which the Irish government believe that it is over for good. We have to be satisfied from what these people say themselves about their own intentions. We are not insisting on a particular form of words. We just need to have an unequivocal assertion that they intend it should be over for good.' In a seeming effort to make it easier for Sinn Fein and the republicans to respond, he repeatedly stressed that the key to opening the door to talks was a public assurance by republicans that the intention behind the ceasefire was a permanent end to violence. Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, wrote last week in the Irish Times that Dublin, the US and the nationalist Social Democratic Labour party in the province had responded 'positively and correctly' to the ceasefire. Sir Patrick said: 'That just falls short, why not just say 'they got our intention right'. If Mr Adams were to say 'the Irish have correctly perceived our intention, to give it up for good' that's fine. Why not say it?' He ruled out a proposal mooted in Dublin last week for a trilateral heads of state summit between the US, the UK and the republic, but saw a positive role for the US in using 'its unique channels of communication with republicans' to persuade them to make it plain publicly that they intend that violence is over for good. The US understood the realities of Northern Ireland, he said, and it would be very helpful if the Clinton administration were to point out to the republican movement the genuine basis for the British government's uncertainty over IRA intentions. If British concerns could be satisfied, he said, it was worth remembering that Sinn Fein could be included in direct exploratory talks with London within three months. The word 'within' had been used, he said, to preserve some sort of flexibility. The framework document intended to kick-start all-party talks later this year, would be a negotiable document. 'There is no question of imposition.' He acknowledged there were on-going difficulties but said London now accepted that amendment to the republic's territorial claim to Northern Ireland 'would need to be put as part of an overall package'. This would be essential to win unionist support for an overall accommodation. Sir Patrick was ambivalent on whether Dublin's insistence on amendment of the 1920 Government of Ireland Act, which established partition, would be included in the framework document. 'Everybody knows the government of Ireland Act is relevant to the package. What the circumstances in which they are going to be relevant maybe time will tell.' He said the dispute over whether future cross-border structures would have executive powers could possibly be dealt with by legislatures in both Northern Ireland and the republic delegating powers to joint boards or bodies. 'That seems to make a lot of sense,' he said.   Countries:-  IEZ  Ireland, EC.     GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P9721 International Affairs.   Types:-  NEWS  General News.

0,FT944-2521 ,"FT944-2521 _AN-ELSBNAADFT 941216   FT  16 DEC 94 / New Irish PM pledges to continue work for Ulster peace      By JOHN MURRAY BROWN and DAVID OWEN      DUBLIN   Ireland agreed a new coalition government led by the conservative Fine Gael party yesterday, ending a month of political uncertainty after a scandal dragged down its Fianna Fail-Labour predecessor. Mr John Bruton, the Fine Gael leader, supported by 85 votes to 74, becomes Ireland's 10th prime minister, leading a coalition with Mr Dick Spring's Labour party and the Democratic Left of Mr Proinsias De Rossa. Mr Bruton, who succeeds Fianna Fail's Mr Albert Reynolds, said the government's first national aim would be to sustain the Northern Ireland peace process. In London, Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, said he had sought an early meeting with the new Irish premier. Mr Bruton is expected to have his first meeting with Mr Gerry Adams, the leader of Sinn Fein, at today's session of the Dublin government's National Forum for Peace and Reconciliation. Mr Bruton told the Dail (parliament), his government would 'work ceaselessly and sensitively to make peace a permanent part of our future'. His election was welcomed by unionists in Northern Ireland. Mr Peter Robinson, Democratic Unionist MP for East Belfast, said Mr Bruton had a greater understanding of the Ulster Unionist position than most members of the Irish parliament. His desire to change articles two and three of the republic's constitution - claiming territorial jurisdiction over Northern Ireland  - was a 'promising backcloth' to his term in office, Mr Robinson said. Mr Bruton conceded that the government was made up of parties whose 'origins and policies' were very different. But he insisted that 'differences don't have to pose a threat'. Fine Gael, a rurally based party with largely middle-class support, will have eight ministers. Labour, which has projected itself as a European-style secular party, will have six ministers - the same number it had in the outgoing administration. However, Labour's Mr Ruairi Quinn will take over the finance portfolio, the first time it has not been held by the largest party. Democratic Left, the successor of the Official IRA when the Provisional IRA split to pursue the armed struggle in 1970, dropped its earlier insistence on two cabinet positions. The main points of the new government's agreed programme include moves to keep public borrowing below 3 per cent of gross national product; tax cuts for the low paid; a freeze on privatisation; a referendum on divorce; and a commitment to the Northern Ireland peace process. The breakthrough coincides with talks yesterday in Belfast between the British officials and loyalist paramilitaries. David Owen adds: In London, Mr Major said he was confident the new Dublin government would wish to 'sustain together the work we have done over Northern Ireland'.

0,FT934-4527 ,"FT934-4527 _AN-DLCDFACWFT 931203   FT  03 DEC 93 / IRA 'set to step up military campaign'      By JIMMY BURNS      BELFAST   The IRA plans to step up its military campaign if the Dublin talks do not produce acceptance by London of the principle of self-determination for the people of all Ireland. According to republican sources the IRA has been carefully weighing up its military and political options in the approach to the meeting of the two prime ministers today. The IRA is convinced that any ceasefire in the present circumstances - whether official or not - risks undermining the efficiency of the organisation. A republican source said: 'Like in any army the fear is that a period of inactivity undermines morale. It also provides the space for an examination of conscience.' It is widely suspected in the IRA that previous extended ceasefires were used by the security forces to infiltrate the organisation. The IRA is still officially backing the peace process and Sinn Fein, its political wing, has been stepping up its distribution of posters backing the Hume-Adams initiative. Although details of this have not been released, the initiative aims to bring about a permanent cessation of IRA activities as part of a comprehensive political settlement for Northern Ireland, including a constitutional shift of the kind for which Dublin appears to be pressing. The IRA had scaled down its operations until this week to facilitate the possibility that the heart of the Hume-Adams proposals might be absorbed by the Anglo-Irish peace talks. With the resumption of attacks on soft targets - yesterday's murder of a British soldier, a failed bomb attack on an army patrol and a bomb attack on an RUC policeman - the IRA has signalled an internal decision to keep up the pressure on the British government as it attempts to appease Unionist opinion. The resumption of still relatively low-scale IRA military operations has come against a background of outrage by the republican movement at the government's claim that the IRA had come to it declaring that the conflict was over and asking for advice on how to give up its military campaign. Another republican source said: 'Anyone who knows the IRA and those close to it knows that the suggestion that Martin McGuinness would send such a message to the government is prepos-terous.' Supporters of the IRA in the Catholic community admit that in the aftermath of the Shankill and Derry killings last month a feeling of war-weariness is setting in. But there is no indication that they expect the IRA leadership unilaterally to declare a ceasefire in the absence of any palpable political gains. The IRA's own military 'volunteers' are strongly resistant to any deal with the British government that might smack of surrender. So far there is no evidence of any substantial division between hawks and doves in the republican movement over the suitability of conducting contacts with the government either directly or through intermediaries. In the approach to Christmas, however, a continuing political debate over tactics and strategy is likely to intensify in the IRA and Sinn Fein. In recent years the IRA's traditional three-to-four-day ceasefire immediately before and after Christmas Day has become a matter of routine, with terrorist activity resuming almost immediately afterwards. But in the charged and complex current circumstances, with much at stake, any decision on a ceasefire by the IRA is likely to have considerable political significance. The only certainty to emerge from the affair over the documents is that the IRA regards its mix of politics and violence as entirely legitimate and effective in focusing the minds of governments.

But the crisis may have only been postponed, not averted, with many Labour MPs adamant that the party should pull out of the government coalition in the row over the controversial appointment of Mr Harry Whelehan, the attorney-general, as president of the High Court. Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, promised a full explanation in parliament on Tuesday for the appointment and an emergency meeting of Labour MPs decided to delay further action until then. This means that today's meeting between Mr Dick Spring, the Labour leader and foreign minister, and Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, will go ahead. At this meeting the Dublin and London governments will review progress on the joint framework document for a durable settlement for Northern Ireland. Mr Spring said yesterday, after the six-hour meeting with his parliamentary party, that he would await Mr Reynolds' explanation but in the meantime all Labour ministers would boycott cabinet meetings. Mr Reynolds, in a statement yesterday, warned of the damage that could be inflicted on the peace initiative by an early election. This same view was expressed by Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein leader. In a statement on Saturday he said: 'The peace process is still at a delicate and sensitive stage. I hope that the present strains between the government parties can be resolved satisfactorily and that party political and other difficulties can be put aside.' Sinn Fein in particular is anxious to avoid an early election, not simply for the delay to peace talks it would cause, but for the chances that the party might have to deal with a new prime minister, perhaps less accommodating to republican sentiment than Mr Reynolds and his Fianna Fail party, traditionally the party of constitutional republicanism. The peace process has already been shaken by the murder of a Newry postal worker on Thursday. In a move to distance itself from the Newry incident, the IRA issued a further statement saying the use of all weapons had been banned since its ceasefire announcement at the beginning of September. In spite of the Newry incident, the improved security climate in Northern Ireland was underlined by the attendance at yesterday's Belfast remembrance day service of the Duchess of Kent, the first member of the Royal family to take part in more than 25 years. The trigger for Labour's threat to quit the Irish government was Mr Reynolds decision to appoint Mr Whelehan as High Court president. Mr Whelehan, a leading conservative lawyer, has on several occasions been embroiled in controversy as attorney-general, including the famous X-case - the 14-year-old rape victim who was stopped from having an abortion in England. But observers point to the sharp deterioration in relations between Mr Reynolds and Mr Spring which a senior government official said had reached an 'irretrievable breakdown'.

He told an audience of Conservative MPs that the document was designed to give the terrorists a say in shaping the province's political future. Arguing that the declaration would also strengthen the Irish government's role in Ulster's affairs, Mr Paisley said Dublin now had the right to decide 'the sort of institutions and structures to be set up in Northern Ireland. 'Cross-border bodies with a permanent unionist minority and, as proposed by Dublin, with executive functions, are the next stage on the surrender road,' he said. The DUP leader's words came as Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, called on Mr Bill Clinton, the US president, to lift the ban on his entry to the US. Insisting that Sinn Fein was not engaged in armed struggle, Mr Adams said US authorities could help the Northern Ireland peace process by allowing him in to the US. The Sinn Fein president has been invited, along with other leading Ulster politicians, to address the National Committee on American Foreign Policy in New York next week. Mr Adams recently failed in his appeal against an exclusion order keeping him out of mainland Britain. Meanwhile, the political talks process involving the province's constitutional parties continued in Belfast yesterday afternoon with a meeting between Mr Michael Ancram, a junior Northern Ireland minister, and the mainly Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party's four Westminster MPs. The Northern Ireland Office said the two sides agreed on the need for further early progress in the talks 'across all three strands'. They plan to meet again soon.

This emerged as the Irish government yesterday sought to play down its plans for the early release of IRA prisoners, announced on Monday, after an angry response from unionist politicians and warnings that they could derail the peace process. The meeting, expected to be informal, follows the postponement of talks due last week. It will come after a meeting between British and Irish officials this Friday to resume detailed work on the so-called framework document. Expectations are mounting that the document could be completed by mid-December. A meeting on it last week is understood to have resulted in progress on the issue of north-south relations, one of the sticking points that has impeded progress since the summer. There are also long-standing differences over constitutional issues, in particular Dublin's territorial claim over Northern Ireland enshrined in Articles 2 and 3 of the Irish constitution. A completion date next month would coincide with the first anniversary of the signing of the Downing Street declaration on December 15 1993. Downing Street said yesterday that Mr John Major, the prime minister, would launch an international investment conference in Belfast, two days before the anniversary. Irish officials said yesterday the release of IRA prisoners did not have an immediate bearing on the framework document. The issue is not controversial in Dublin and Mr Albert Rey-nolds, the Irish prime minister, and other government officials had signalled the prospect of an early release of IRA prisoners several times since the IRA ceasefire on August 31. The Irish government's move was attacked by the Reverend Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionist party, and some mainland British politicians. Mr Paisley claimed the British government had a secret agenda and was working on plans of its own for prisoner releases. Mr Andrew Hunter, leader of the Commons back-bench committee on Northern Ireland and Tory MP for Basingstoke, said: 'It is a very serious miscalculation on the part of Dublin, the sort of miscalculation which can undermine confidence in the peace process.' An IRA commander was jailed for 25 years yesterday. English-born Dr Feilim O'Hadhmaill, 36, a lecturer at the University of Central Lancashire, Preston, was sentenced for spearheading an IRA bomb plot on mainland UK before the August ceasefire.

Mr Adams, in a joint communique issued in Northern Ireland with Mr John Hume, the leader of the nationalist Social Democratic Labour Party (SDLP), said that 'significant progress' had been made towards the conditions necessary for a 'peace-ful and democratic accord'. The statement, in which they said they were hopeful that the peace process could be moved forward, came after a week of suggestions and hints that the IRA might be about to call an extended ceasefire in an attempt to put pressure on the British and Irish governments to make concessions over possible peace talks. They warned that: 'In any new situation there is a heavy onus on the British government to respond positively, both in terms of the demilitarisation of the situation and in assisting the search for an agreed Ireland by encouraging the process of national reconciliation.' There is growing expectation that an extended IRA ceasefire will be announced this week. Although most unlikely to be a declaration of a permanent end to the IRA's 25-year military campaign, there are hopes it could mark the first step in de-escalating the conflict. London and Dublin would almost certainly react to even an extended ceasefire by saying it did not amount to a permanent cessation of violence and so did not justify allowing republican leaders into political talks on Northern Ireland's future. Whitehall officials have been particularly heartened by the hard line recently taken on this issue by Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister. But an open-ended ceasefire would put the two governments under intense pressure to make some conciliatory gesture. Republican leaders would hope that this pressure would in turn put the governments' united front under fresh strain. A series of meetings between Mr Hume and Mr Adams from April last year was one factor which provided impetus for the peace process. It was followed by the signing of the Downing Street declaration in December last year by Mr John Major, the British prime minister, and his Irish counterpart, Mr Albert Reynolds. Last night Mr Reynolds, in a detailed response to the joint statement, said there was an historic opportunity for a settlement of the Ulster conflict. 'It is clear that Sinn Fein and the IRA are in the final stage of their deliberations,' he said. Meanwhile, the Ulster Unionist party disclosed last night that its leader, Mr James Molyneaux, will have discussions with Mr Major in Downing Street during the week about the search for peace. The Downing Street declaration offers Sinn Fein a seat at the negotiating table in the event of a permanent IRA ceasefire, and an eventual simultaneous referendum in both parts of Ireland on a future constitutional arrangement for the province.

0,FT934-8997 ,"FT934-8997 _AN-DKLCNAEBFT 931112   FT  12 NOV 93 / UUP offers Ulster peace hope: Unionist party prepared to forge close links with Irish Republic      By TIM COONE and KEVIN BROWN      DUBLIN, LONDON   THE Ulster Unionist party has told the government it is prepared to forge 'close and visible links' with the Irish Republic as part of a Northern Ireland settlement. The proposals conflict sharply with a peace plan published yesterday by the Democratic Unionist party, led by the Rev Ian Paisley, which rules out any role for Dublin. However, the UUP's approach bodes well for the peace process launched two weeks ago by Mr John Major, the prime minister, and Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish premier. The Major-Reynolds initiative has shown signs of running out of steam as a result of Unionist fears that Dublin is willing to talk to Sinn Fein, the political arm of the IRA. Ministers are understood to see the UUP's proposals as signs of 'positive thinking' that could contribute to a settlement in proposed round-table talks between the two governments and Northern Ireland's four non-violent political parties. Mr Ken Maginnis, the UUP deputy leader, said the proposals were based on the party's final presentation to the last round-table talks, which broke down a year ago. The UUP blames the failure of the last round on the Irish government's refusal to cede ground on Unionist demands for the withdrawal of its constitutional claim to the province. The Irish government has since said it would be prepared to drop its territorial claim as part of an overall settlement that would be subject to majority consent. The UUP proposals were discussed this week by Mr Major and Mr James Molyneaux, the UUP leader. They focus on the creation of a Northern Ireland assembly with an inter-Irish relations committee, which would represent a 'formal link' with the Irish parliament. The UUP also proposes a bill of rights to allay the fears of the Catholic minority, and a 'meaningful role' in the administration of the province for the nationalist SDLP. The DUP proposals, entitled Breaking the Logjam, call for elections to a Northern Ireland assembly, which would draw up a new constitution for the province within the UK. The document, handed to the government six weeks ago, says that proposals gaining 60 per cent support within the assembly would be put to parliament. The final package would be subject to a Northern Ireland referendum. Mr Paisley said Sinn Fein would be allowed to stand for election to the assembly, but would be excluded from negotiations on the form of the government.

In remarks that dashed expectations of an early decision by the republican movement on accepting the declaration as a basis for peace in Northern Ireland, Mr Adams demanded changes in the British government's position. He said that although Dublin had given some clarification of the declaration, London had 'stalled, delayed and refused' to explain further a document which he described as a 'masterpiece of ambiguity'. He claimed it would be impossible for Sinn Fein to give a definitive response without more information. Both London and Dublin have repeatedly insisted that the IRA must end violence before Sinn Fein can join talks on the future of Northern Ireland. When they meet next weekend, Mr John Major, the prime minister, and Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish premier, will be expected to declare their determination to press on with the broad process of negotiations. Giving no sign of any softening in Sinn Fein's stance, Mr Adams rejected what he described as the unionist veto on constitutional changes in Northern Ireland. He insisted that London would have to join the 'persuaders' in seeking to convince unionists that their future lay 'with the rest of the Irish people'. Interviewed on ITV's Walden programme, in which Mr Adams's statements were read by an actor, he called on ministers to go the extra mile for peace. 'Unless the British government says to the unionists: 'Your future rests with the rest of the Irish people' - unless it makes that small step forward, then that government cannot say it is interested in peace.' He said republicans recognised that they needed the consent and full participation of unionists in the process, but that they did not want the British government 'sitting on its hands and blaming and using the unionists'. Mr Adams added: 'Let us not squander the opportunity for peace on the rock of either a veto or on the British refusing to join the persuaders.' Mr Adams said if the British government believed the joint declaration was a basis for a political settlement, it should be prepared for further discussion. Downing Street said last night the government's position on the declaration remained unchanged. It said it was 'deeds not words' that were important and that all the IRA had to do if it wanted progress in Northern Ireland was to abandon violence.

Senior ministers from both countries, including Mr Spring, joined forces to emphasise that there could be no negotiations with Sinn Fein without a permanent end to IRA violence. Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, edged towards accepting Mr Spring's weekend message that a temporary IRA ceasefire would be 'a step in the right direction'. Sir Patrick acknowledged that a temporary ceasefire would be 'better than violence'. Their efforts came as the Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the hardline Democratic Unionist party, emerged from a stormy meeting with Mr John Major to declare that June's European elections in Ulster would in effect be a referendum on the Downing Street declaration. Mr Paisley said he intended to meet the prime minister again after the DUP had secured 'a firm mandate from the people'. The DUP leader - whose party is boycotting the political talks process  - traditionally secures the biggest vote in the province's European elections. Mr Michael Ancram, the Northern Ireland minister, said Mr Major 'took Mr Paisley to task' for misinterpreting the joint declaration on a number of occasions, and areas of common ground were 'fairly few and far between' in the course of a 'very frank' 30-minute meeting. Downing Street officials said Mr Major told Mr Paisley and his DUP colleagues that he had a UK-wide mandate for the task of stopping the day-to-day horror in Northern Ireland. In Dublin, Mr Spring and Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, emphasised after talks that there would be no negotiations with Sinn Fein unless there was 'a clear and unequivocal renunciation of violence' by the IRA. But Mr Spring reiterated that Dublin would seek to build on any temporary IRA ceasefire. Mr Hurd used a speech in Dublin to the Institute of European Affairs to argue that the relationship between Britain and Ireland had been transformed and was 'no longer transfixed by difficulties rooted in the past'.

'I believe the opportunity should not be passed by,' Cardinal Daly said. 'It should not be rubbished.' Speaking less than 24 hours after the prime minister denounced the IRA's move as 'self-serving and cynical', the Primate of all-Ireland said the ceasefire raised 'significant hope', although it was 'disappointingly short'. 'I am afraid, respectfully, I would not agree that this is a cynical exercise on the part of the IRA,' he added. 'The significance is that for the first time in 20 years they have initiated this cessation of violence. Why not test it?' As the leaders of the three main opposition parties in the Irish republic issued a joint peace demand to the IRA, Archbishop Robin Eames, the Protestant Primate of the Church of Ireland, responded to the ceasefire in a more downbeat vein. Although any cessation was to be welcomed, he said: 'The real Christian agenda for Northern Ireland must be written by those who see that a complete end to violence . . . will give us the opportunity to plan the way forward in peace and justice.' Yesterday's developments came as the British and Irish governments reaffirmed that the ceasefire, starting at midnight on Tuesday, falls far short of the permanent cessation required to admit Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, into round-table talks. Sinn Fein has called for 'immediate and direct talks' with the British government to obtain clarification of the Downing Street declaration signed by London and Dublin last December. Dublin has expressed 'extreme disappointment' with the IRA's response to the declaration, with Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, urging Sinn Fein to spell out what it means by its latest clarification demand. A senior aide to Mr Reynolds said he would not seek to put pressure on Mr Major to open talks with Sinn Fein. He said that Dublin would keep communication open to Sinn Fein, and 'would have no objection' if London did the same. Underlining Dublin's growing exasperation with Sinn Fein, Mr Reynolds has departed for a week-long holiday in Cyprus. Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, has said he 'would not seek to protract' any talks with the British government and emphasised that Sinn Fein is not seeking negotiation, only clarification. Sinn Fein is expected to further outline its position tomorrow when Mr Martin McGuinness, a member of the party's national executive, addresses a rally in Dublin commemorating the 1916 Easter rising. Meanwhile, the Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the hardline Democratic Unionist party, said he planned to visit the US this month to 'tell the truth' about Northern Ireland.

The meeting was confirmed against a background of rising violence in Belfast in the wake of Saturday's IRA bombing in the Protestant Shankill Road, which killed 10 people. Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, said he expected both prime ministers to give the Hume-Adams initiative 'very serious attention on Friday to see where the process can go from here'. But Mr Major's determination not to alienate the Ulster Unionist party was last night reflected by signs at Westminster that the government was now ready to back unionist demands for the establishment of a Northern Ireland select committee. The prime minister has denied that he did a deal with the Ulster Unionists to avoid a Commons defeat in a confidence debate on the Maastricht treaty earlier this year. But with the tacit backing of Downing Street, the Commons procedure committee is expected today to give a positive response to demands for a select committee. Such a move would represent a clear signal of the government's commitment to ensure that any settlement in the province would have to secure the whole-hearted backing of the protestant community. Extra troops and police were moved to Belfast from elsewhere in Northern Ireland yesterday after two Roman Catholics were killed and six wounded in two separate incidents. Mr Major told the Commons the perpetrators of this week's terrorist attacks would be 'hunted down and subjected to the full severity of the law'. However, the government ruled out the reintroduction of internment. Sir John Wheeler, the Northern Ireland security minister, said there were 'no simple, easy solutions'. Downing Street continued to distance itself from the peace proposals put forward by Mr John Hume, leader of the mainly Roman Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party, and Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the political arm of the IRA. Officials said Mr Major was willing to talk to Mr Reynolds, but was more interested in reviving the stalled 'three-strand' talks under the auspices of Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary. In an indication of the sensitivity with which the issue is regarded in London, Downing Street said neither Mr Major nor Mr Reynolds had asked for a bilateral meeting in Brussels. British officials said the Brussels summit offered a 'useful opportunity' for a meeting, but stressed that there was no formal agenda. Downing Street also continued to maintain that Mr Major had not seen the Hume-Adams proposals, and was unaware of the details of the initiative. Irish officials said the Shankill Road bombing had 'seriously damaged' the Hume-Adams initiative, but Dublin appeared keen to keep the proposals alive. Mr Spring said the two governments had an 'obligation' to look at 'any opportunities' to bring about peace in Northern Ireland 'despite the (IRA) atrocity of last weekend'.

Ms Maire Geoghegan-Quinn, the Irish justice minister, also said talks were taking place with Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, on the surrender of the IRA's weapons. The move prompted immediate concern in London about the speed of events in Dublin and was greeted with dismay by rightwing Conservative MPs and Ulster unionists. Ms Geoghegan-Quinn said details of the numbers to be freed and the timetable of their release had yet to be fixed. 'But I can confirm that a number will be released between now and Christmas,' she said. The minister stressed that there was no question of trading prisoners for weapons. 'But the dismantling of IRA arsenals is being actively pursued,' she added. Last night the British government would say only that the release of terrorist prisoners was a matter for the Irish government. A Downing Street spokesman said: 'The prime minister has repeatedly made it clear in the past that IRA prisoners are serving sentences for criminal offences. They are not political prisoners and the question of an amnesty does not arise.' Privately, ministers are sanguine about Irish concessions to the IRA, which they hope will help to lock the terrorists into the peace process. There is concern in London, however, that Dublin is moving too quickly. Ministers are also keenly aware of the need to reassure unionists that their interests are not being ignored in the struggle to draw the republican movement into mainstream politics. Mr Henry Bellingham, Conservative MP for Norfolk North West, said he was 'deeply disturbed' about the announcement. 'I can understand why the Irish government want to keep the momentum behind the peace process going, but I think they are taking far too big a risk,' he said. Mr Bellingham, a member of both the British Irish Parliamentary Body and the Conservative Friends of the Union, said it was too early for such a release of terrorist prisoners, which would merely strengthen the IRA's active service units if the peace process broke down. Mr Bellingham said Conservative MPs would accept that it was not possible for Britain to prevent the release of terrorists convicted in Ireland. 'But I hope very much that Downing Street will make its grave displeasure very clear to the Irish government in private,' he said. Mr Ken Maginnis, the Ulster Unionist MP, said he was becoming increasingly worried by what he described as the republic's piecemeal approach to the ceasefire which was in contrast to Mr Major's more considered and structured attitude.

Security services were alerted shortly after midnight when 'incendiaries' were fired near terminal four. However, an airport official said it appeared that none had detonated and there had been little damage. There were no reports of casualties. Scotland Yard officers later confirmed that three mortar shells were found in the south-east area of the airport close to terminal four. There were also reports of two suspicious packages. The airport's southern runway and a perimeter road were closed. The attack followed non-specific warnings to the media. Initial reports indicated that three thuds were heard, but police were unsure of the location of the launch site. The London Ambulance Service said it was alerted at 12.11am to 'an act of aggression' at Heathrow. Ambulances and fire engines were standing by. The second assault underlined fears in London and Dublin that the republican movement has rejected the peace initiative. Both governments were united in their condemnation of Wednesday's attack - which yesterday led to calls for an inquiry into security operations at Heathrow - and accepted the likelihood that it signalled rejection by the republican movement of the peace initiative. Nevertheless Mr John Major, the prime minister, insisted the search for peace would continue. Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, described as 'despicable' remarks made by Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, in a radio interview in which he appeared to warn of more possible events like Wednesday's attack on Heathrow. Mr Adams said: 'This attack comes in the middle of a stalemate. I would ask now for John Major to end the stalemate. There are causes of conflict; the conflict is ongoing. Every so often there will be something spectacular to remind the outside world.' Mr Adams' remarks came as an off-duty RUC officer was shot dead last night in Belfast. Ministers earlier mounted a joint effort to demonstrate they will not be knocked off course in attempts to reach a political settlement in the province. Mr Major and Mr Albert Reynolds, his Irish counterpart, claimed that the IRA's latest action and the failure of Sinn Fein to react positively to the Downing Street declaration would not deter London and Dublin from pressing on. At Westminster, Mr Major told MPs the 'unjustifiable' IRA attack would make 'no difference whatsoever' to the search for peace. He said the declaration set out 'a series of principles upon which we hope and intend to try and build a permanent peace in Northern Ireland'. In the Dail, Mr Reynolds attacked the IRA action as 'criminal and politically naive'. But both London and Dublin privately accept that the political momentum which followed December's declaration has largely been lost. They are resigned to an extended and highly problematical process aimed at establishing a framework for progress involving the province's constitutional parties. Speaking after yesterday's Anglo-Irish conference in London, Sir Patrick said the first Heathrow attack had shown that the IRA could not make its case democratically and had again resorted to force. Sir Patrick stressed that both governments were committed to continuing the so-called three-stranded political talks process and added: 'There is no limit to our patience because there is no limit to the advantages that success in that process will bring'. He emphasised, however, that the prize of prosperity and peace might lie 'at the end of a very long road but a road on which neither government is going to weary of travelling'. Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, in one of the most downbeat assessments from Dublin on the chances of an end to IRA action, said that 'the credit is running very low, if not totally expired' on the part of those who had yet to make up their mind on the Downing Street declaration. Mr Seamus Mallon, deputy leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party, dismissed the bilateral talks in the province as 'a stopgap' that did not go to the heart of the problem. Mr John Taylor, Ulster Unionist MP, came near to calling for the three-stranded approach to be abandoned. Security probe, Page 7 Editorial Comment, Page 17   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

As Northern Ireland enjoyed its first day free from the threat of sectarian violence for 25 years the prime minister told Conservatives in Bournemouth that his cautious approach had paid dividends. 'If I had listened (to those urging me to hurry) we would not today be where we are with the guns stilled and the bombs stopped,' he said. But he balanced this with an assurance that the government would enter the 'window for peace' if it could do so 'with honour and with consent'. He said: 'We cannot let history freeze us into inaction.' His speech followed a lunch-time telephone conversation with Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, in which the two men took stock of recent developments. They discussed the much-delayed framework document with which their two governments hope to inject momentum into the political talks process involving the province's main constitutional parties, but are not thought to have fixed a date for their next meeting. Downing Street said both prime ministers were 'greatly encouraged by the loyalist ceasefire in the context of overall progress over the past six weeks'. Dublin described the exchange - which came after Mr Reynolds reacted to Thursday's loyalist announcement by urging Mr Major to respond positively to the new situation - as 'very useful'. The idea that London should open a 'reversible' dialogue with Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, will be considered by Mr Major and cabinet colleagues next week. Ministers have acknowledged that talks could start by Christmas. Sinn Fein representatives will probably have started by this time to participate in Dublin's Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, which Mr Reynolds expects to get running next month. The forum will be attended by all leading political parties in the Irish Republic as well as the mainly Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party and the non-sectarian Alliance party. Unionists have declined to take part. Speaking on the eve of the Ulster Unionist party conference in Carrickfergus, Mr Major paid tribute to Mr James Molyneaux, saying the UUP leader had been right that the most significant aspect of the 44-day-old IRA ceasefire was 'the victory of ordinary people over the terrorists'. The loyalist ceasefire was 'another victory for ordinary people', he said. 'Today, for the first time in a quarter of a century, the people of Ulster have woken up to peace. Our determination must be to make that peace permanent.' Speaking within days of the 10th anniversary of the Brighton bomb, when the IRA attempted to murder the British cabinet, he sought to reassure unionists that British troops would not be withdrawn from Ulster prematurely.

Downing Street said Mr John Major, the prime minister, who has been kept closely informed about the shootings, would not be diverted by the gunmen. Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, said terrorists had to be prevented from dictating the political agenda in the province. He added: 'Last night's slaughter of the innocents puts more pressure on us to accelerate our efforts to find a formula for the cessation of violence and get the constitutional parties back around a negotiating table. 'One of our major problems is the lack of a political process and dialogue. Consequently the men of violence are allowed to take centre stage, and that has to be addressed immediately.' The London-Dublin initiative was condemned by Mr Peter Robinson, deputy leader of the hardline Democratic Unionist party, who said it was part of the 'nationalist agenda'. He said the initiative had 'raised the temperature' in the province. 'We are only half a step away from Northern Ireland being out of control. If the violence continues like this the ordinary man is going to take sides for protection.' However, there was widespread support for the governments' determination to press ahead. Mr Kevin McNamara, Britain's shadow Northern Ireland secretary, said the killings were 'absolutely horrendous'. It was 'urgent that full attention should be paid to the Major-Reynolds initiative to find a solution which will respect the integrity of both communities and to establish institutions which can be useful both to the people of Northern Ireland and to the people of Ireland'. Mr Seamus Mallon, deputy leader of the nationalist SDLP, said the shootings were 'another bloody milestone in the move towards peaceful resolution of the problems here'. Dr Robin Eames, the Anglican primate of all Ireland, said he did not believe that the joint statement by Mr Reynolds and Mr Major had prompted the killings. 'Obviously people's minds will centre on the reaction to the recent inter-governmental announcement, but my experience is that these terrorists, whoever they are, don't have to look for a reason,' he said. 'This is psychopathic blood-letting and their so-called banner of 'For God and Ulster' on the one side and 'For a united Ireland' on the other are now irrelevant to most people.' Mr Martin McGuinness, vice-president of Sinn Fein, said the murders were a brutal reminder of the conflict in Northern Ireland. He urged the nationalist community to remain calm and vigilant.

On the eve of a Downing Street meeting this afternoon between Mr John Hume, the SDLP leader, and Mr John Major, the officials said the initiative linked an end of IRA terrorism with a place at the negotiating table for Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA. That link - implying that IRA violence was being rewarded with a role for the nationalists in any future settlement - could not be accepted by London or Dublin. Mr Major and Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, last week rejected the initiative put forward by Mr Hume and Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, as a basis for their efforts to restore peace to the province. They instead pledged to press ahead with their own initiative, although Irish officials said it might incorporate 'elements' of Hume-Adams. Neither government has been ready to discuss the details of the plan or the reasons for its rejection since it was handed to Mr Reynolds last month and later reported by him to Mr Major at their Brussels meeting last Friday. Mr Hume, who insists that it represents the best hope for more than 20 years of a permanent cessation of violence, has stressed repeatedly that the plan offered the prospect of a permanent end to the IRA's armed campaign. Colleagues of Mr Hume have suggested that he will consider publishing his agreement with Mr Adams if the two governments continue to rebuff him. For his part Mr Major will seek this afternoon to draw the SDLP into round-table talks proposed for the province's constitutional parties. But the officials said the Hume-Adams proposals left unanswered a range of questions about the intentions of Sinn Fein. Mr Adams appeared unwilling to modify the nationalists' central claim - which is anathema to London - that the future of Ulster should be determined by the majority of all Ireland. Even if those differences could have been 'finessed', the proposals contained the fatal flaw of assuming that an end to IRA violence could be part of the process in which Sinn Fein was drawn into negotiations. Mr Major agreed with Mr Reynolds last week that a permanent end to IRA violence would receive an 'imaginative' response from the two governments. But the officials said that both prime ministers had agreed there could be 'no question' of any understanding with Sinn Fein in advance of such a move. Mr Major was determined any cessation should be unconditional and permanent, a stance accepted by Mr Reynolds in the two leaders' joint statement.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

On Thursday Mr Albert Reynolds, Ireland's prime minister, was drummed out of office, after allegations that he misled parliament over a controversial extradition case involving a paedophile Catholic priest. The resignation of Mr Reynolds has left Ireland under a caretaker administration, while parliament tries to agree a new coalition. But the absence of a government in Dublin has also left the delicate peace process apparently frozen. The crisis was triggered by opposition to the appointment by Mr Reynolds of Mr Harry Whelehan, a former attorney general, as president of the Irish High Court. Mr Whelehan's former office is facing allegations that it delayed for seven months the extradition of Father Brendan Smyth to face charges in Northern Ireland of child abuse. Mr Whelehan has also been involved in other controversial cases, including the investigation in 1991 into the misuse of official export credits in Ireland's beef scandal. As attorney general, he issued an injunction in the notorious 1992 'X-case' to prevent a 14-year-old rape victim travelling to the UK for an abortion. When Mr Reynolds persisted in making the appointment, the coalition between his Fianna Fail party and Mr Dick Spring's Irish Labour party collapsed after 22 months in office. Mr Reynolds resigned as prime minister before a parliamentary vote of confidence that he would have lost. Mr Whelehan, the cause of the crisis, resigned from his new office. At one point, however, it seemed that the affair might have much more far-reaching consequences. Mr Pat Rabbitte of the Democratic Left, told the Irish parliament of documents that would 'rock the foundations of the state'. Rumours circulated in the Dail, Ireland's parliament, that the head of the Catholic Church, Cardinal Cahal Daly, may have intervened on Father Smyth's behalf - a rumour quickly scotched by the Cardinal with good humour. Such was the massive public interest in the drama unfolding in the Dail, even pilots on Aer Lingus flights felt obliged to provide their customers with constant in-flight updates as the government teetered. Dublin's troubles could hardly have occurred at a more awkward time for the peace process. The UK and Irish governments have been locked in talks on the framework document that will form the basis of future talks involving Ulster's principal political parties. Ideally, this would have been finalised before London begins the exploratory talks it has promised to open with Sinn Fein before Christmas. Some disruption to the timetable now seems unavoidable. Agreement between the parties on a new coalition could be days, perhaps weeks away. If the search fails, parliament will be dissolved and the country will have to go to the polls. That would certainly require prolonged negotiations over a new coalition before a government could be formed. It could be into the New Year before the Irish are ready to push the peace process forward. The composition of any new coalition could have wide ramifications for the peace process. All the Irish parties are publicly committed to the process and all have endorsed the Downing Street Declaration that was signed by Mr Reynolds and Mr John Major last December. However, it is widely believed in Dublin that Fianna Fail, a party formed to oppose partition and the 1921 Anglo-Irish Treaty, may be better placed to persuade the hardline republicans of Sinn Fein to go along with a settlement. Mr Reynolds was criticised, even in Dublin, for being over-hasty in embracing the Sinn Fein leaders, greeting Mr Gerry Adams, the party's leader, with a handshake on the steps of Government Buildings less than a week after the IRA ceasefire. However, Mr Reynolds argued that a bold gesture was needed from Dublin to bolster the moderates in the movement. Similar thinking was behind his idea of a cross-party Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, which had its third sitting in Dublin Castle yesterday. There are many officials in Dublin who feel it will be difficult in the short term for a new government to achieve the sort of understanding with Sinn Fein that Mr Reynolds and his top advisers enjoyed. Such rapport may be hard to replicate with a government led by Fine Gael, the main opposition party, a conservative party that is identified historically as the pro-1921 treaty party. With Fianna Fail on the opposition benches, Fine Gael might also find it harder to promote the constitutional change that unionists in the North see as a central part of any settlement. Fianna Fail meets today to elect a new leader to succeed Mr Reynolds. The two names put forward so far are those of outgoing finance minister Mr Bertie Ahern and Justice Minister Mrs Maire Geoghegan-Quinn. Under a new leadership, Fianna Fail may be able to form a new coalition with Labour. The policy programme agreed between the two parties as the basis for the coalition that is now dissolved remains to be completed. However the bitter taste of this week's events will not be easily swallowed. The alternative coalition options may be no easier to put together. Fine Gael, the main opposition party, could form a parliamentary majority with Labour and one of the smaller parties. But relations between Mr Spring and Mr John Bruton, the Fine Gael leader, are described as frosty. Without an early resolution of the political uncertainty, however, progress on the peace process is likely to be impaired.   Countries:-  IEZ  Ireland, EC.     GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

The survey--being detailed in tomorrow's Irish Independent  newspaper and on BBC TV's On the Record--coincides with this  weekend's Sinn Fein annual conference in Dublin.    It also highlighted large support for a security crackdown  on  all para-military groups if the terrorism continues.    The poll was carried out last Wednesday in the Irish  Republic  by Irish Marketing Surveys and on Wednesday and Thursday in  Northern Ireland by Ulster Marketing Surveys.    It came at the height of growing speculation over the timing  of the long-expected response of the IRA and their Sinn Fein  spokesmen to the Downing Street peace declaration.    Earlier tonight, Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams made it  clear in his keynote speech to the party conference that more  time was required for consultations about the joint Anglo-Irish  declaration.    The cross-border survey showed a 79 percent endorsement of  the principle in the Downing Street declaration that it would be  wrong to impose a united Ireland in the absence of the  freely-given consent of a majority of people in Northern Ireland.    And an all-Ireland figure of 76 percent--80 percent in the  Republic and 68 percent in Northern Ireland--supported the  decision of the London and Dublin governments to go ahead with  new inter-party talks on Ulster's future, given that the  republican movement has so far failed to reply to the peace  statement.    Of those questioned on the southern side of the border, 94  percent agreed with calls on the IRA and Sinn Fein to renounce  violence.    In Northern Ireland the figure was 85 percent--87 percent of  the Province's Protestants and 82 percent of the Catholics.    The security clampdown was supported by an average 75  percent  in the two parts of Ireland. In Ulster the move was backed by  88 percent of the Protestants and 61 percent of the Catholics.    Adults over the age of 18 took part in the survey--1,053 in  the Irish Republic and 863 in Northern Ireland, reflecting  population and other factors.     "
0,FT933-895 ,"FT933-895 _AN-DI0BZAB1FT 930927   FT  27 SEP 93 / Sinn Fein enters peace process: Tim Coone glimpses the prospect of political progress in Ulster as bilateral talks raise hopes      By TIM COONE   THE twists and turns of Northern Ireland's politics are rarely clear and the finer details tend to escape those who live outside the province. But a significant event occurred this weekend which will resonate well beyond the parochial confines of the Belfast or Londonderry City Halls or the corridors of the Northern Ireland Office at Stormont. For Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Provisional IRA - which has been waging a terrorist campaign to effect the withdrawal of Britain from the province - has now formally entered a process of negotiation to put an end to the violence. On Saturday evening Mr John Hume, the leader of the Social Democratic Labour party, and Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein leader, jointly announced that they are submitting a report to the Irish government on the progress of their bilateral talks which have been taking place during the past six months. It is intended that the report will be discussed in Dublin and in London. Mr John Major, the British prime minister, was apparently told two weeks ago that such a development was imminent when he met Mr Hume in Downing Street on September 16. Since starting his bilateral talks with Mr Adams, Mr Hume has emphasised that they are not aimed at achieving a simple ceasefire but are aimed at bringing about 'a total cessation of all violence'. Politics in Northern Ireland entered a vacuum in November last year when a series of round-table talks between the main political parties, initiated in 1991 by Mr Peter Brooke, the former Northern Ireland Secretary, broke up without an agreement. Those talks were overseen by the British and Irish governments under the auspices of the 1985 Anglo-Irish agreement, and were designed to produce a replacement for the 1985 agreement and a new constitutional framework for the province. Unionist insistence that the Irish Republic must first drop its territorial claim to Northern Ireland as a basis for continued negotiation was a significant obstacle to progress. Sinn Fein was excluded from the talks because of its tacit support for the IRA, and both governments have refused to negotiate with the party until such time as either Sinn Fein renounces the IRA, or the IRA itself decides to end its military campaign. Frustrated with the failure of the round-table talks, Mr Hume then decided to take a totally different tack. Although the target of much invective and attacks from the Unionists for embarking upon his negotiation with Mr Adams, it is significant that neither the Irish nor British governments have criticised him for doing so. It is still too early to say that a breakthrough has been achieved in the Northern Ireland logjam. as Immensely delicate and careful negotiations remain to be carried out, not least to convince the Unionist parties that there might be some merit in the SDLP-Sinn Fein proposals. But it is highly significant that Mr Hume is today in the US briefing US Congressional leaders about his proposals. As an SDLP spokesman said in Belfast: 'It is not likely that either the British or Irish governments will talk to Sinn Fein yet, until there is an end to the violence. But that does not mean they will not talk through an intermediary.'   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.     IEZ  Ireland, EC.   Industries:-  P9721 International Affairs.

0,FT933-738 ,"FT933-738 _AN-DI1CRABTFT 930928   FT  28 SEP 93 / Ministers seek to reopen Ulster talks with Dublin      By TIM COONE   THE GOVERNMENT of the Irish Republic yesterday confirmed that an Anglo-Irish working party is attempting to 'reconcile differences' in putting together a draft constitutional settlement for Northern Ireland with a view to reviving the stalled inter-party talks on the province. But it has also reaffirmed that the Republic's constitutional claim to jurisdiction over Northern Ireland would be modified to an 'aspiration' only in the context of an overall settlement. It emerged at the weekend that both governments had recently instructed their civil servants to draw up a draft constitutional settlement paper by the end of October which could be tabled at a new round of inter-party talks. The Irish government insisted yesterday that the constitutional issue 'will only be dealt with through a referendum which is part of an overall and balanced settlement'. For the UK, Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, said there would be 'no change whatever' in the constitutional status of Northern Ireland without the consent of its people. In Dublin an Irish foreign ministry spokesman said that 'different political and constitutional scenarios are being discussed and a joint (Anglo-Irish) working party is engaged in reconciling differences between the two government positions'. But there was a sense of confusion and perplexity in Dublin over the turn of events on the Northern Ireland issue, and suspicion that the latest statements coming from the British government 'are not unconnected with the Hume story', according to one official source. Last Saturday Mr John Hume, leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party, and Mr Gerry Adams, leader of Sinn Fein, announced that they are to submit a joint report to the Irish government on the progress so far of their bilateral talks, which have been taking place since last April. Proposals contained in the report are believed to set out a mechanism through which the IRA could be persuaded to abandon its 23-year military campaign, and which would then lead to an inclusion of Sinn Fein in the round-table talks process. It is thought that Mr Hume's current visit to the US is to seek a US government-appointed mediator to facilitate 'arms-length' contact between Sinn Fein and the British and Irish governments. An Irish government spokesman said: 'The government's objective has always been to try and stop the killing and establish a lasting peace (in Northern Ireland) . . . the government looks forward to hearing what progress may have been achieved in the talks between Mr Hume and Mr Adams.' A source close to Mr Albert Reynolds, Irish prime minister, said that Mr Reynolds 'will not be walking away from any proposal that might bring about (a political settlement)'. Mr Hume is due to brief Mr Reynolds in Dublin next week after his US visit. As Downing Street confirmed that the government was trying 'very hard' to get the talks process back on the rails, Sir Patrick stressed that the government would not 'talk or negotiate with' anyone who perpetrates or justifies acts of violence, in a statement pegged to yesterday's bomb explosion in Belfast. Lord Hulme, Liberal Democrat Northern Ireland spokesman, said it was dangerous that 'two separate blueprints for the future' now seemed to be in draft.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

In his first public acknowledgement that he has advised IRA leaders to consider halting their 25-year armed campaign, Mr Adams said he had always argued that 'a changed political climate could break the . . . stalemate and create the potential to eradicate the underlying causes of conflict'. 'In my updated assessment to the IRA leadership I expressed my belief that the current political climate provides that potential,' he said. The IRA leadership assured him that it would 'study my assessment of the present political situation and that it will make a speedy response to it'. His comments came as Mr John Hume, leader of the mainly Catholic Social Democratic and Labour Party, called for talks with Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, to start as soon as possible after a genuine end to IRA violence. Some 24 hours after issuing a joint statement with Mr Adams saying that the 'essential ingredients' for an approach to peace might now be available, Mr Hume said: 'If violence has genuinely stopped, the next step has to be dialogue and I would like to see that begin as soon as possible.' He also responded to scathing unionist criticism of his joint statement, saying: 'They don't seem to be listening to what I am saying. We have said that a new agreement is only viable if it enjoys the allegiance of the different traditions on this island.' The air of optimism was reinforced by Cardinal Cahal Daly, leader of the Irish Catholic church, who said Northern Ireland could be on the brink of the best opportunity for peace in 25 years. But it was tempered by unionist leaders, who voiced fears that Britain might be preparing to make concessions in return for a ceasefire. Mr James Molyneaux, the Ulster Unionist party leader, is likely to raise such concerns with Mr John Major at a meeting expected to be held in a few days. Mr Molyneaux yesterday accused Mr Hume of 'selling his soul to the devil and joining in a sordid attempt to blackmail the British, American and Irish governments into giving the Armalite supremacy over the ballot box'. The outlawed loyalist Ulster Freedom Fighters warned last night that loyalists would not sit back and be 'coerced or persuaded' into a united Ireland. Mr Kevin McNamara, shadow Ulster secretary, warned unionists against trying to block political progress, saying that they should be reassured by guarantees in the Downing Street declaration that there would be no reunification without the consent of the majority in Ulster. The British and Irish governments have repeatedly stressed that a total cessation of violence would be required before Sinn Fein could be admitted to the all-party talks process. Mr Adams said that much common ground had been established by Sinn Fein, the SDLP and Dublin 'with the strong support of Irish-American opinion' and that the 'potential now exists to move the situation towards a democratic and peaceful settlement'. 'If such a settlement - the basis for lasting peace - is to be found there must be fundamental and thorough-going change,' he said. 'I am satisfied that Irish nationalism, if properly mobilised and focused at home and internationally, now has sufficient political confidence, weight and support to bring about the changes which are essential to a just and lasting peace.' Mr Adams called for 'equality of treatment, equality of opportunity and parity of esteem across the entire political, economic, cultural, social, legal and security spectrum'.

The Irish prime minister's comment that written questions from Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, about last December's UK-Irish declaration were 'answerable' was seen as unhelpful by some in the UK government because it raised expectations that the deadlock might soon be broken. But Downing Street yesterday moved towards clarifying one of the questions raised by Sinn Fein by hinting strongly that acceptance of the joint declaration was not a precondition for involvement in political talks. Downing Street said the 'primordial' requirement for Sinn Fein to enter talks was a permanent end to the IRA's armed campaign. It said this renunciation of violence was 'at the heart' of the declaration. London intends to publish the text of Sinn Fein's questions, which were forwarded by Dublin, at the same time as its comments, probably tomorrow Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, has sketched out the areas covered by the questions without giving precise details. Government sources at Westminster were yesterday playing down expectations of what might emerge from London's comments. They said many of the questions raised matters that would only be resolved after further talks between Ulster's constitutional parties. At least one of them constituted a 'trick question', since it appeared to refer to a unionist veto that the government has consistently maintained does not exist. As unionists warned of a likely upsurge in loyalist violence if the government's response to Sinn Fein was too explicit, police launched a drive against suspected loyalist terrorists in Belfast. Following the largest operation of its kind this year, police were last night questioning up to 20 people, including the suspected leader of the outlawed Ulster Defence Association. The Royal Ulster Constabulary said it had seized three submachine-guns and 300 rounds of ammunition. But the cycle of violence continued when a 35-year-old Roman Catholic man was shot and injured while making a regular weekly delivery to a shop in north Belfast. Downing Street insisted last night that the government was not 'in the business of clarification' and had only 'helped the Downing Street declaration to explain itself'. It said the exercise of commenting on the Sinn Fein document was 'no different in kind' from previous speeches. 'The fact that Sinn Fein appears to find it necessary to produce a document indicates that they and the IRA are having to justify their actions to fellow nationalists.' Mr Reynolds's comments came after unscheduled talks in the US with President Bill Clinton. The Irish prime minister said he hoped London would give the most positive response it could.

An Irish government official said Mr Albert Reynolds, the republic's prime minister, would seek to resolve the wrangle when he met Mr John Alderdice, the Alliance leader, on Friday. Mr James Molyneaux's Ulster Unionists and Rev Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionists have said they will not attend. A boycott by the Alliance would add to the perception among Protestants that the forum is a pan-nationalist front. With regard to seat allocation, a spokesman for the small, non-sectarian Alliance party said: 'Anything less than equal to Sinn Fein is completely unacceptable.' Under the proposed allocation Sinn Fein would have three seats, the Alliance two and the SDLP five. For the republic Mr Reynolds' Fianna Fail party would have nine seats, Labour five and Fine Gael six. The dispute comes amid renewed calls from Northern Ireland's moderate nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party for the UK to reduce its troop presence in the province to underpin the peace process. Dublin is keen to use the forum to build confidence between the two religious traditions on the island. The Alliance is moderate and non-sectarian, and unlike the main unionist parties it favours a Dublin contribution to any solution and is committed to the Anglo-Irish talks. It has never won a seat in parliament but has the same number of councillors as Sinn Fein, received only slightly fewer votes than Sinn Fein at the general election and had a bigger representation at the last Stormont assembly.

But ahead of their planned talks at Chequers, there were signs of Irish irritation at a move by Mr Major to separate plans for an Ulster assembly from wider talks on the province's status. The meeting will follow British denial of a claim by Mr Martin McGuinness, a leading official of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, about private assurances by the British government. Mr McGuinness said on BBC television that during secret contacts last year, a British civil servant had said London was working towards a united Ireland. Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, said the claim was 'nonsense'. Mr Major hopes to persuade Mr Reynolds that the territorial claim to Ulster in Articles 2 and 3 of the Irish constitution is the main obstacle to an agreed approach. Dublin has agreed to modify the claim, but the British side will argue that unless Mr Reynolds goes further, moderate unionists in Northern Ireland will reject a proposed framework document for talks on the province's future. The Irish prime minister, meanwhile, is concerned that Mr Major appears to have weakened Britain's commitment to the comprehensive 'three-stranded' approach to negotiations. Mr Major said last week that proposals for strand one - the creation of an assembly - were separate from the Anglo-Irish framework document, which would cover strands two and three. Those concern relations between north and south and between London and Dublin. Mr Reynolds spelt out his demands yesterday that the proposed cross-border institutions in strand two of the process must be given 'executive functions'. He said: 'Such institutions also must address some of the key interests common to north and south on a pragmatic basis.' Irish officials said Mr Reynolds wanted today's meeting to 'pick up the pace'. He was anxious to harness Sinn Fein to the political process quickly to bolster Republican moderates. Dublin will also press for flexibility on the issue of the surrender of IRA arms. Mr Reynolds repeated his view that the question 'had to be confronted and dealt with but is not a precondition for talks'. In a move underlying Irish concerns, police in the republic detained several people over the weekend in a four-county operation against 'elements of Sinn Fein-IRA who may try to destabilise the peace process'. One Irish newspaper yesterday said the IRA would review its ceasefire decision in the spring. Mr McGuinness warned: 'If the central issues at the heart of this conflict are not addressed or resolved, there will continue to be conflict.'   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

In an interview at Stormont Castle, Belfast, yesterday, Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, restated the British government's refusal to embrace Sinn Fein in the search for a political solution until the IRA ended violence permanently. With ministers acutely aware that Sinn Fein has scored another propaganda victory in Mr Adams' US visit, Sir Patrick's uncompromising position was endorsed by Mr John Major, the prime minister, in the Commons. In New York, Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, said Mr Adams' remarks had been characterised by 'ambiguity and evasion'. The US administration also moved quickly to emphasise that its decision to admit Mr Adams on a 48-hour visa did not reflect policy differences with the British government over Northern Ireland. President Bill Clinton, rejecting calls for more US pressure on Britain, said at a press conference: 'Let's be fair. The people that have to resolve this are the Irish and the British.' He described the peace initiative taken by Mr Major and Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, as 'astonishing' and said Mr Adams should back it. Sir Patrick dismissed Mr Adams' renewed calls for clarification as delaying tactics. After a briefing to members of the congressional committee on Irish affairs, Mr Adams said he was anxious to find a proposal to put to the IRA to enable it to end its conflict. 'The ball is firmly in the British court,' he said. Mr Adams repeated his calls for British government action when he addressed the national committee on American foreign policy. But Sir Patrick, who said it was 'a pity' that Mr Adams had been given a platform in the US, insisted that it was Sinn Fein which had 'the key' to a peaceful solution. He said: 'The only rational choice for an organisation that has a political objective is to accede to the declaration, end violence and make it clear that you have ended violence, and then make use of what has been offered. Sinn Fein has the key. The key is their ability to give up violence.' Referring to the Sinn Fein president's recent letter to Mr Major, Sir Patrick said that it 'did not seek any clarification or explanation of any specific matter at all. It is entirely clear that what he wants is a renegotiation of the declaration.' He claimed that Mr Adams' continuing refusal to be specific meant that there was no 'genuine request for enlightenment and the most likely candidate for an alternative explanation is the desire to play for time'. Mr Adams, in calling on the government for talks on the mechanics of a negotiated settlements, said: 'Mr Major has talked of a first step in the peace process. What is the second step and the third step?' He said peace would be difficult to establish but prospects were better than ever before.

0,FT944-13283 ,"FT944-13283 _AN-EJ1D8ABXFT 941028   FT  28 OCT 94 / Historic echoes for Sinn Fein      By JOHN MURRAY BROWN   A small piece of history will be made in Dublin today when Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, meets the republic's mainstream political parties for the first time as the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation gets under way. The 35-member forum, which will sit once a week, will include Northern Ireland's moderate nationalist Social Democratic Labour party and the province's small, non-sectarian Alliance party. But with no formal representation from Ulster's majority unionists, the forum has already been dismissed as a pan-nationalist front. Certainly, if there is to be a reconciliation it will be between the fractured parties of Irish republicanism, rather than Ireland's two religious traditions. For the return of Sinn Fein to the political fold is itself a momentous event. All Ireland's constitutional parties apart from Labour trace their origins to Sinn Fein, which led the war of independence against British colonial rule. Officials are quick to point out the parallels with the 1983-84 New Ireland Forum, where the task had less to do with reassuring unionists than bolstering the constitutional nationalists of Mr John Hume's SDLP which, in the wake of the hunger strikes, was losing electoral ground to Sinn Fein. Today Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, is the central mover behind the project. He sees a real urgency to rehabilitate the hardliners of Sinn Fein and a danger that the peace process could unravel if this is not achieved. The forum is seen as a period of political quarantine for Sinn Fein in the countdown to full political talks with London and the all-party discussions on the future of the province. The going will not be easy. Sinn Fein will no doubt try to take the high ground as the only all-Ireland political party, contesting elections north and south of the border - a border which it does not recognise. Its language of liberation may encourage the armed volunteers in the field, but is not likely to go down well in the more cynical confines of Leinster House, the Irish parliament. In one important respect Sinn Fein is on its own. It is the only party represented not to have endorsed the Downing Street declaration, or what the Irish prefer to call the Joint Declaration, the 12-point accord which set the peace process in train last December. Pointedly, the forum's terms of reference spell out that it is set up in accordance with the joint declaration.   Countries:-  IEZ  Ireland, EC.   Industries:-  P9711 National Security.

Among Northern Ireland politicians, nationalists greeted the ceasefire announcement with delight while unionists voiced suspicion that the statement did not signal a permanent end to the IRA's terrorist campaign. Sir George Gardiner, chairman of the 92 group of Thatcherite Tory MPs, warned of the risk of 'igniting opinion in the majority of Northern Ireland' if ministers moved too fast in response to the IRA ceasefire. Mr Andrew Hunter, a member of the Commons Northern Ireland committee, feared it could be 'a tactical ploy - a pause in the killing'. He said: 'You cannot possibly sit at a table and negotiate with people who will resume killing if they don't get what they want in those negotiations - that is an impossible situation.' An indication of the potential Tory opposition to constitutional talks with Sinn Fein came with the publication of a pamphlet by Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, who argued against involving Sinn Fein in talks. The pamphlet, written before yesterday's announcement, said Sinn Fein's participation in a constitutional conference would put ministers 'in the position of being held responsible for the next round of terror if they do not give in to the IRA blackmail of threatening to pull out'. On the left of the Tory party Mr Peter Temple-Morris said people were 'afraid of peace'. Another Tory backbencher urged unionists to 'seize the opportunities of peace' and break the 'hatred of the past'. Mr Tony Blair, Labour leader, gave a cautious welcome to the IRA ceasefire, but stressed the test would come in whether it led to a permanent renunciation of violence. Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, said: 'If the IRA has at last realised that it cannot achieve its aims through violence, then this is a very important moment for peace in Northern Ireland.' In Northern Ireland, unionist politicians said the IRA should surrender its arsenal of weapons and explosives to prove it was serious about ending terrorism for good. But Mr John Hume, leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party, who put his reputation on the line by talking with Sinn Fein, said the ceasefire would be 'welcomed by Irish people everywhere, but particularly by the people in the streets of Northern Ireland. Now we face the primary challenge which is to reach agreement among our divided people.' The Rev William McCrea, an MP from the hardline Democratic Unionist party, said the IRA was not seeking peace but trying to blackmail the government for more concessions. Dr John Alderdice, leader of the moderate Alliance party, commented that actions would speak louder than words. Mr Terry Carlin, regional officer of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, called on 'all paramilitary organisations to halt the violence. There's a lot of work to be done in healing the wounds and the mental and physical scars of social deprivation.' A number of broadcasters, led by Mr John Birt, the BBC director-general, last night called on the government to reconsider broadcasting restrictions on Sinn Fein members in view of the ceasefire.

0,FT934-1984 ,"FT934-1984 _AN-DLPC5ACEFT 931216   FT  16 DEC 93 / The Joint Statement on Ulster: IRA volunteers face tough choice      By JIMMY BURNS   The IRA is facing unprec-edented political pressure to lay down its arms, but the nature of its own military organisation means it is far from guaranteed that it will agree to a permanent cessation of violence. It is made up of 'volunteers', many of whom have remained on the sidelines of political developments. They have been hardened and encouraged by their 'war' against the British. Moreover, of all the statements made by the House of Commons yesterday, Mr Major's rejection of an amnesty for IRA prisoners would have touched a particularly raw nerve. The IRA believes it retains the capacity to continue to conduct a successful campaign of attrition against the British by attacking members of the security forces and perhaps targeting the mainland. Indeed, the latest peace process is viewed in the short-term as stemming from the IRA's attacks on the mainland over the past two years and the way they have focused government attention on the Irish question. The terms of yesterday's declaration fall short of the IRA's historic idea of victory, however - Irish unity and a withdrawal of British troops. In the next few days the IRA will be reminding itself that previous experiences of ceasefire led to a weakening of its morale. The IRA leaders face pressure from their political allies in Sinn Fein to weigh their options. But the men of arms see the question they face as what kind of initiative can they take if they are not to be frozen out by the climate of acceptance for the Reynolds-Major plan. The IRA is likely to seek concessions from the British government to mitigate any suggestion that a ceasefire amounts to a surrender. These may include a withdrawal to barracks of the security forces to match any ceasefire. As far as the IRA is concerned the acid test of whether peace is really on the cards will come nearer to Christmas Day, when the organisation will have to decide on what terms, if at all, it declares its traditional seasonal ceasefire. The peaceful three-month period before talks with Sinn Fein is being viewed in the republican movement as an attempt to put pressure on the IRA to extend its ceasefire well beyond the new year. It is not inconceivable that the IRA may be persuaded by Sinn Fein to declare an extended - though not open-ended - ceasefire in order to put the ball back in the government's court.

0,FT934-1931 ,"FT934-1931 _AN-DLPC5ADVFT 931216   FT  16 DEC 93 / Leading Article: A well-judged declaration   It is too soon to say whether yesterday's remarkable joint declaration by Mr Albert Reynolds and Mr John Major will lead to peace in Northern Ireland. The prime ministers have produced a document which demonstrates that there is no valid reason for a continuation of violence. The effectiveness of their carefully-constructed argument will now be put to the test. It will succeed if the IRA and the loyalist paramilitaries are amenable to reason, but fail if they continue to behave like mindless terrorists. This was clear to everyone in both the British and Irish parliaments yesterday. As Mr Major told the House, he cannot force the IRA to lay down its arms; he can only urge it to do so. The Irish view is that, since the loyalists say that their own violence is retaliatory, an IRA ceasefire should lead to general peace. The initial reaction from Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, was 'disappointment', but it should study the document further. With Mr Reynolds, Mr Major has produced in a single declaration a summation of the positions taken by both the British and Irish governments. The right to self-determination of the inhabitants of the island, expressed separately in the north and the south, is acknowledged. Irish nationalists have an undertaking that if they manage to persuade a majority of Northern Ireland's inhabitants to choose a united Ireland, the British government will accept that. Exploratory talks Three months after disavowing violence as a means of struggle, and persuading the IRA to lay down its arms, Sinn Fein would be invited to join exploratory talks. As part of an overall political settlement Mr Reynolds is ready to renounce his government's constitutional claim to the north. The Ulster unionists are promised, for the umpteenth time, that no change in the constitutional status of the province will be made without the consent of its voters. These propositions, wrapped in layers of reassuring phraseology, should in all sanity constitute a helpful step towards peace. No entrenched position is compromised, but a democratic path to the settlement of disputes is laid down. The sense of hope that this engendered yesterday was reflected in the House of Commons. The Labour leader, Mr John Smith, welcomed the document 'with enthusiasm'. Most backbench responses to Mr Major's statement were congratulatory or friendly, give or take one or two doubting Tories. Studied neutrality Of particular significance is the fact that the most important unionist leader, Mr James Molyneaux, was helpfully non-committal. Without his studied neutrality, there could be no progress. The most recalcitrant unionist, the Rev Ian Paisley, was predictably outraged. On the nationalist side, Mr John Hume, the leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party, said that the Major-Reynolds paper was 'one of the most comprehensive declarations that has been made about British-Irish relations in the past 70 years'. This broad welcome should give the IRA much to ponder. The very reasonableness of the Downing Street declaration, as yesterday's document will probably be called, could further isolate the proponents of violence within the republicans' natural constituency. Those in the US and continental Europe who have expressed sympathy with Sinn Fein in its struggle against British 'imperialists' should note Mr Reynolds's signature alongside Mr Major's. As Mr Smith said yesterday, there was no excuse for the bombing and shooting in the first place. Any shred of justification that some might have clung to has now been stripped away. Whether or not yesterday's initiative leads to a cessation of hostilities, the two prime ministers fully deserve the praise that has been heaped upon them. Both took a political risk when, in Dublin as in London, each assumed responsibility for seeking peace in Northern Ireland. As Mr Major observed, in a sharp response to Mr Paisley, this would be expected of any prime minister. In doing his job, Mr Major has on this matter risen above the mundane. He has shown persistence, courage and a fine grasp of detail. Presenting the result to the House yesterday, he displayed these qualities at their best.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

0,FT943-6023 ,"FT943-6023 _AN-EIAD1ABMFT 940901   FT  01 SEP 94 / The IRA Ceasefire: Next step hangs on the missing word      By DAVID OWEN   The ceasefire is complete - but is it permanent? On that question yesterday hinged what happens next in the Northern Ireland peace process. When it flashed on to news screens at 11.54 am, the IRA's statement contained many fine phrases and much grounds for optimism. But it pointedly avoided committing the organisation to the permanent cessation of violence which London and Dublin have demanded before allowing Sinn Fein into political talks on the province's future. Instead it promised a 'complete cessation of military operations' as of midnight last night. It might seem churlish to quibble over semantics on one of the most historic days in the province's recent history. But IRA leaders must have known that their statement would be judged by many on the basis of whether it committed them to a permanent ceasefire. It seems inconceivable, therefore, that the word's exclusion was not carefully judged and deliberate. This was certainly the view of unionists, who quickly warned that the statement did not fulfil the two governments' terms. Mr James Molyneaux, the Ulster Unionist party leader, said bluntly it could not 'trigger' the countdown of the three-month period within which London has promised to enter preliminary dialogue with Sinn Fein in the event of a permanent end to violence. It is crucial that Mr Molyneaux stays on board if the revitalised peace process is to stand any chance of success. Mr John Major's initial response to the statement, first circulated about lunchtime, was somewhat ambiguous. 'I am greatly encouraged by this, but we need to be clear that this is indeed intended to be a permanent renunciation of violence, that is to say, for good,' he said, implying that the clock would not start ticking without clarification from republican leaders. 'If they are genuinely and irrevocably committed to use only peaceful and democratic methods in the future, then we shall respond positively.' But his exhortation to 'let words now be reflected in deeds,' suggested it might be acceptable for the clarification to take the form of an extended period without violence. Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, later aligned the government firmly with Mr Molyneaux, however, saying that the question of permanency had to be resolved before the government would consider that the three-month period had started. 'This is so important a matter that it ought not to be left at large or able to be the subject of discussion and argument,' Sir Patrick said. His words appeared to open up daylight between the government's stance and the position of Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, who said he thought IRA violence was permanently finished. It also opened the prospect of a tense period of cat-and-mouse politics involving the two governments and republican leaders, similar to that which followed the Downing Street declaration. Under the timetable set out by the government, preliminary talks would begin with Sinn Fein within three months of it receiving the assurances it requires. This would have three purposes: To explore the basis on which Sinn Fein would be admitted to an 'inclusive political talks process'. To exchange views on how Sinn Fein would be able in time to play the same part as the other constitutional parties in Ulster's public life. To examine the practical consequences of ending violence. These practical matters would be expected to include the handing in of IRA weapons, the treatment of IRA prisoners, the question of security and the broadcasting ban on Sinn Fein representatives. Some ministers believe the ban no longer serves any useful purpose and should be lifted as soon as possible. On troop deployment, the government is expected to emphasise that decisions are the responsibility of military commanders. But a reduction of troop strength in response to a reduction in the perceived threat of violence has not been ruled out.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.     IEZ  Ireland, EC.

0,FT934-7109 ,"FT934-7109 _AN-DKVCMAACFT 931122   FT  22 NOV 93 / Major reassures Ulster Protestants over veto      By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor   Mr John Major moved to regain the initiative in the Northern Ireland peace process by reassuring the Protestant majority last night that they retained a veto over any change in the status of the province. After the weekend disclosure of fresh talks between Mr John Hume, the Social Democratic and Labour party leader, and Mr Gerry Adams of Sinn Fein, Downing Street flatly rejected any possibility that a revived Hume-Adams peace plan could form the basis for a political settlement. The prime minister's office dismissed speculation at the weekend that it might respond to a cessation of violence with an amnesty for IRA and loyalist terrorists. Downing Street said that since there were no 'political prisoners' in Northern Ireland, an amnesty would not arise. It declared that the presence and number of British troops in the province could not be a subject for negotiation. That was coupled with a strong reaffirmation that the government's 'constitutional guarantee' to the people of Northern Ireland meant that the democratic rights of the majority would never be prejudiced. Mr Major's determined move to reassure the Protestant majority - and above all Mr James Molyneaux's Ulster Unionists - followed signs in recent days of growing unease among moderate Unionists over the direction of the peace process. The leak of draft proposals from the Dublin government on its terms for a political settlement risked threatening the Ulster Unionists' acquiescence in Mr Major's negotiations with Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister. Mr Major is relying on the support of the nine Ulster Unionists MPs to get through controversial legislation at Westminster. The prime minister is also aware that without Mr Molyneaux's backing it will be impossible to secure an Ulster settlement. Officials said detailed British proposals for a new accord to replace the 1985 Anglo-Irish agreement fell far short of Dublin's call for a significant element of joint responsibility in the administration of the province, although it recognised Dublin's aspiration to a united Ireland. Downing Street said that Mr Major remained determined to press ahead with negotiations to secure a political settlement in close co-operation with Mr Reynolds. The Irish prime minister yesterday offered an upbeat assessment of the possibility of a permanent cessation of violence by the IRA and its loyalist counterparts. Mr Reynolds also distanced himself, though rather more gently than the British government, from the Hume-Adams initiative. However, the differences between the two leaders over the route to a settlement have been reflected in wrangling over the date of the planned Anglo-Irish summit in Dublin next month. Irish officials insisted the date had been set for December 3. But British officials suggested Mr Major thought more time might be needed to decide the framework for a political settlement. Officials said the government would review the number of troops needed in the province if there were a permanent cessation of violence.

0,FT933-951 ,"FT933-951 _AN-DI0BZAAHFT 930927   FT  27 SEP 93 / New Ulster constitution planned: Anglo-Irish working party to draft an outline settlement for Northern Ireland      By TIM COONE   THE BRITISH and Irish governments are seeking to draft a new constitutional settlement for Northern Ireland in a last-ditch attempt to revive stalled talks on the political future of the province. Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, and Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, have asked a joint working party of civil servants to present the draft by the end of October. Their decision, agreed privately at this month's meeting of the Anglo-Irish conference, reflects the growing view in London that the two governments have only a narrow window of opportunity to restart the political process. But there was uncertainty last night over whether the weekend initiative by Mr John Hume, the SDLP leader, and Mr Gerry Adams, the leader of Sinn Fein, would hinder the process. The initiative was greeted by some in Ireland as offering the best prospects for peace in more than 20 years. The SDLP and Sinn Fein, in a joint report to be delivered to the US and Irish governments, have proposed appointing a US mediator to break the political impasse in Northern Ireland. Mr John Major, the prime minister, was given an outline of the proposals by Mr Hume two weeks ago in London. Mr Hume made it clear he wanted to break out of the present framework for negotiations. But Sir Patrick insists there can be no negotiations with Sinn Fein until it unequivocally renounces violence. At the heart of the settlement under discussion between London and Dublin would be a commitment by the republic to replace its constitutional claim to jurisdiction over Ulster with an 'aspiration' to achieve a united Ireland. London would acknowledge in return that if ever a majority in the province favoured re-unification then it would respect that view and pass the necessary legislation. It would also agree to a significant extension of cross-border co-operation involving the creation of joint executive boards in such areas as transport, tourism and relations with the European Community. The aim of the draft is to create an 'umbrella' under which the Protestant and Catholic political parties in the province could be persuaded to resume the round-table talks on internal political arrangements which broke down last year. In parallel, Mr Michael Ancram, the Northern Ireland minister responsible for political affairs, is engaged in an intensive round of contacts with the Unionists and with the mainly Catholic SDLP. Sir Patrick is said to be 'hopeful' rather than optimistic that the approach will succeed. He has been encouraged, however, by a number of recent developments, including the decision by Mr Ian Paisley, the leader of the Democratic Unionists, to table his own proposals for a political settlement. There is a growing feeling in London that Mr Paisley fears he could be outflanked by the official Ulster Unionists, led by Mr James Molyneaux. There is a growing view among many senior ministers that the next few months could offer the last chance of a settlement during the lifetime of the present parliament. By January the parties in the province will be launching their campaigns for the local and European elections. Mr Hume and Mr Adams have been involved in bilateral talks since last April. In a weekend statement they said: 'We are convinced from our discussions that a process can be designed to lead to agreement among the divided people of this island, which will provide a solid basis for peace. Such a process would obviously also be designed to ensure that any new agreement that might emerge respects the diversity of our different traditions and earns their allegiance and agreement'. A spokesman for the SDLP said the joint proposals meant Sinn Fein was effectively a partner in the negotiations. Unionist leaders last night urged the British government to reject Sinn Fein's claims to be a party in the talks. Sinn Fein enters peace process, Page 10   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

He declined at a meeting in Dublin to give precise details of questions submitted by Sinn Fein to the government of the Irish republic and passed on to the UK authorities. But he outlined issues on which his party expected progress: What are the means and within what timescale does the British government expect to see agreement reached between all the Irish people? What are the constitutional options which Britain sees as a realistic alternative to the present constitutional structures? What are the long-term political objectives of the British government in relation to Ireland? On what basis does the unionist veto exist, and how far does it extend over constitutional change and political policy? If the Government of Ireland Act claims sovereignty over Northern Ireland, why was it not mentioned in the declaration? What are the subsequent steps which the British government envisages in the peace process? What are the structures and processes which the government expects to be developed from the declaration? Is acceptance of the declaration a precondition for involvement in talks on the development of new political arrangements? What is the process which will lead to 'de-militarisation'? Mr John Taylor, Ulster unionist MP for Strangford, yesterday accused the UK government of 'playing the tune' of the IRA. He said the people of Northern Ireland had lost all confidence in Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary. 'He has been sent written questions from the IRA via Sinn Fein, via the Dublin government, and then posted into London, and he is going to answer those written questions and publish the answers,' Mr Taylor told BBC Radio.

0,FT944-10830 ,"FT944-10830 _AN-EKIEIACDFT 941109   FT  09 NOV 94 / Peace process flies free of jails issue: Dublin's IRA prisoner release announcement      By DAVID OWEN, STEWART DALBY and JIMMY BURNS   Dublin's announcement that it intended to release several IRA prisoners before Christmas sparked a critical reaction yesterday from unionists and some Conservatives. But there seemed little prospect of the move blowing the Northern Ireland peace process off course. British and Irish officials working on the framework document, which the two governments hope will form the basis of a durable political settlement in the province, are understood to be making headway again after a period when little progress was achieved. The recent suggestion by Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, that the much-delayed document should be ready before the first anniversary of the signing of the Downing Street declaration on December 15 does not seem to be regarded as unrealistic in Whitehall. Mr Reynolds and Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, would have an opportunity to discuss the matter at the European Union summit in Essen, Germany, on December 9 and 10. More may become clear following a meeting between Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, and Mr Dick Spring, Irish foreign minister, which is expected to take place next Monday in Ireland. Meanwhile, there seems no reason to suppose that preliminary talks between the British government and Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, should not start before the end of the year, as Mr Major has indicated. Topics to be covered would include the dismantling of republican arsenals. The two governments disclosed last month that officials had started talks on the logistics and mechanics of arranging for weapons in the hands of paramilitaries to be given up. But Mr Major declined to say whether the handing over of weapons was likely to begin in advance of the preliminary talks. Unionist reaction to Monday night's announcement by Dublin was divided. The hardline Democratic Unionist party (DUP) referred to a 'secret agenda' under which London would agree to the IRA's demands. But the moderate Ulster Unionists (UUP) said they were worried about the 'increasing divergence' between London and Dublin. Mr Ian Paisley Jr, a DUP spokesman, said: 'The Irish government has behaved recklessly in announcing prisoner releases. It confirms what we have been saying all along. The British government is surrendering to the IRA and the republic.' Mr Ken Maginnis, UUP security spokesman, said: 'I do not think there is a two-handed conspiracy between Westminster and Dublin. Quite the reverse. I am worried about the increasing divergence between the two governments; between Ireland's piecemeal approach and Mr John Major's correct structured approach.' Mr David Trimble, UUP legal affairs spokesman, said: 'I think the prisoner releases underline the growing differences and widening gap between London and Dublin. Dublin is trying to put pressure on London over prisoners because London put pressure on Dublin over arms surrender.' Mr Andrew Hunter, chairman of the Tory backbench Northern Ireland committee, described the announcement as 'a serious miscalculation by the Irish government'. He said: 'The peace process can only maintain its momentum if it retains the confidence of both sides of a deeply divided community . . . this is the first incident which, if repeated, could spell trouble.' Mr Seamus Mallon, deputy leader of the mainly Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party, said the republic's decision did not mean arbitrary releases. He said: 'It is an approach which should be applied in Northern Ireland through review procedures so that as peace lasts, so the prison population decreases in a way which would signal a new era for Northern Ireland.' Downing Street emphasised yesterday that Dublin's policy on the release of prisoners in the Irish Republic had no implications for London's policy on convicted prisoners. It said it had repeatedly made clear that those convicted of criminal offences would serve their sentences. Dublin's move was widely seen as evidence of its concern to maintain the peace initiative's momentum in order to bolster moderate voices in the republican movement. According to security and republican sources, the Sinn Fe'in leadership is coming under increasing pressure from hardliners in the IRA to obtain significant political concessions from the British government. Restlessness is deepening among IRA volunteers in the rural areas of Armagh and Tyrone who feel that the peace process is bringing about no radical change in the British government's position on Northern Ireland. This section of the IRA is seeking an early release of political prisoners, a withdrawal of troops, and a commitment to united Ireland. The republic has 56 IRA prisoners in its jails compared with about 400 in British jails.   Countries:-  IEZ  Ireland, EC.   Industries:-  P9721 International Affairs.   Types:-  NEWS  General News.

0,FT943-5955 ,"FT943-5955 _AN-EIAD1ADIFT 940901   FT  01 SEP 94 / Leading Article: The prize in Ulster   It is still not clear that the ceasefire announced yesterday by the Irish Republican Army is permanent, a necessary condition for political talks involving Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing. But the substance of the announcement seems unambiguous. There is a widely-held feeling on all sides in Northern Ireland that a new phase has begun, a turning away from the violence that has brought misery to nationalists and unionists alike. That alone is cause for rejoicing. There are few parallels that can be drawn between Ulster and long-running conflicts in South Africa and the Middle East. But events in these other places show that, when all sides are committed to finding a solution, there is a momentum in the peace process that sweeps away many of the real or imagined obstacles. That this point appears to have been reached in Northern Ireland is a tribute to effective co-operation between the UK and Irish governments. Mr John Major deserves credit for placing a solution in Ulster on his list of priorities. He has made clear that Britain has no strategic interest in Northern Ireland apart from protecting the right of its people to determine their future. He has also taken risks, most notably in conducting secret exchanges with Sinn Fein leaders. Those risks appear to have paid off, thanks to his cool determination under fire. Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish Taoiseach, has also been prepared to take risks. In last December's Downing Street Declaration, he acknowledged the right of the people of Northern Ireland to remain in the UK unless they decided otherwise. He also undertook to amend the claims in the Irish constitution to the north - essential in reassuring unionists. The peace process will not be smooth. There will be those among both the republican and the 'loyalist' communities who will try to disrupt it. There may be a breakaway from the IRA, with diehards seeking to continue the violence. The process will have to survive whatever 'spectaculars' are thrown up at a time when trust may still be in short supply. There is also the fear of betrayal among the unionist majority that must be constantly and convincingly assuaged. It was their opposition that derailed two previous attempts at constitutional settlements involving the Irish Republic. The main Unionist party, led by Mr James Molyneaux, has sensibly accepted the assurances of the Downing Street Declaration on Northern Ireland's right to self-determination. But the Reverend Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionists seem to be flirting with the idea that any peace must involve unacceptable concessions to Dublin. Now, therefore, is not a time for complacency but for renewed efforts to maintain the momentum. Mr John Hume, leader of the moderate nationalists, advises throwing away the formal timetable for bringing Sinn Fein to the conference table. This advice should be politely turned down. The quarantine period of three months after a permanent ceasefire is the least that will be acceptable to the unionists. But there is scope to provide immediate benefits to all the people of Northern Ireland that will carry forward the peace process. One priority must be to scale down the military presence to the minimum level compatible with protecting all sections from maverick terrorists. Another is to lift the absurd ban on broadcasting the voices of Sinn Fein members which has done so much harm to the UK's reputation abroad. A peace process involves a dialogue, and a dialogue is impossible if one side cannot be heard. Finally, amendments to articles 2 and 3 of the Irish constitution to remove the unqualified claims to the north are promised as part of a final settlement. Bringing forward the changes would bolster unionist confidence. The ceasefire demands further risks on all sides to win the bigger prize of lasting peace in Ireland.

During the address, the culmination of Mr. Major's three-day  trip to the US, he also:     -  Pledged to go ahead with the  ""three strand"" talks on Northern Ireland, despite the rebuff he  has suffered from the Ulster Unionists;    -  Announced he hoped the  GATT world trade deal could be implemented on January 1, 1995 --  six months ahead of the original plan.    Mr. Major said: ""Britain has changed out of all recognition  in the past 15 years and is changing again in the 1990s.""    He told his audience: ""Like you, we have just come through a  recession. It was painful, but we have come out stronger than  before.    ``This past year, Britain's economy has been growing twice  as  fast as forecast. And this coming year we are again expecting  the fastest growth rate among main European countries.''    However, Mr. Major stressed that more change was needed for  Britain to sharpen its competitive edge.    ""That is why we are embarked on a fundamental review of all  the factors affecting our ability to succeed in the global  marketplace. Competitiveness is the key challenge for the 1990s  -- and it is one the British welcome.""    The Prime Minister pledged: ""What we are working for is  nothing less than the reskilling of Britain for the 21st  century.""    He said added that it was not just industry that must  innovate, but government as well.    ""The days of monolithic government are over. The governments  that will help their countries to be competitive will do less  but do it better. All our government departments have been told  to roll back the burden of regulation.    ``There is one British produce I want to see less of -- our  famous red tape.''    Mr. Major said Britain and America were now driving through  the historic GATT trade deal.    He and President Clinton had agreed they should set an early  target for tariff cuts to be implemented -- January 1, 1995 --  but other countries had to be consulted before this could become  a reality.    Mr. Major also stressed that Britain was the ideal base for  operations in Europe, saying: ""It is no accident that nearly 40  percent of all U.S. investment in Europe comes to Britain. We  intend to keep it that way.""    He claimed that much of Europe was over-regulated, something  which cost jobs and added to the burdens carried by employers.    On Bosnia, the Prime Minister said he and President Clinton  had agreed that Britain and the U.S. would take joint action to  build on the Sarajevo ceasefire.    ""We are sending a joint British-American planning mission to  see how we can help restore public utilities there.""    He said they both believed in firm action to enforce the  no-fly zone and that Britain was supporting the American-led  diplomatic initiative to seek agreement between Bosnia's Croats  and Muslims.    On Northern Ireland, the Prime Minister spoke of the  overwhelming support the Downing Street Declaration had  received, highlighting the BBC poll showing over 90 percent of  people throughout the island of Ireland wanted Sinn Fein to  renounce violence.    ""Yet they continue to hold back from the peace process and  perpetuate violence. There have been 17 attacks on the security  forces since the declaration.""    The Prime Minister said he hoped Sinn Fein could yet be  persuaded to change.    ""I believe that strong support for peace coming from America  can play a part in this. In the meantime, the British and Irish  Governments will continue to work with the constitutional  parties for a lasting political settlement.""     "

It looked as though the process had gone awry on Tuesday when London dismissed as 'premature' a historic meeting in Dublin between Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, and Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president. While Mr Reynolds eagerly accepted Mr Adams' assurance that the IRA had ended its terrorist campaign, Mr John Major continued to demand guarantees that there would be no return to violence. Meanwhile, in a theatrical confrontation in Downing Street, Mr Ian Paisley, Ulster's single most popular Unionist leader, was ejected from the cabinet room for refusing to accept that Mr John Major does not tell lies. The dramatic series of events prompted reports of renewed tensions between London and Dublin amid speculation that Mr Reynolds wishes to move much faster towards all-party talks on Northern Ireland than Mr Major thinks wise. There are clear differences of perspective between London and Dublin, not least because most of the carnage inflicted by the IRA has been within the UK's borders. The view from Dublin is also coloured by the historical fact that all the Irish political parties except Labour are descended from the old Sinn Fein party which campaigned for independence from Britain. Perhaps because of these links the Irish government is more convinced than London of the permanence of the Sinn Fein leader's change of heart, and less concerned about a possible slide back to violence. In spite of their differences the two governments are moving in tandem towards the dual objective of entrenching Sinn Fein within the democratic process while demolishing unionist suspicions of a sell-out to the IRA. The British government was obliged to deprecate the speed with which Mr Reynolds moved to meet Mr Adams because of the widespread distaste for the Sinn Fein leader among unionists and Tory rightwingers. But ministers are aware that the ceasefire declaration was opposed by a hardline faction in the IRA, and that it could collapse unless Mr Adams is able to show results from the so-called 'unarmed struggle.' For the same reason the government has reduced security in Northern Ireland, and would not be greatly unhappy to see Mr Adams make a second propaganda visit to the US, although it would formally urge President Clinton not to grant a visa. Mr Major also accepts that Mr Adams cannot deliver the guarantee of a 'permanent' end to violence that London originally demanded because that would be regarded by the hardliners in the IRA as tantamount to surrender. Ministers remain hopeful that a form of words can be agreed, although leading republicans say that further clarification is unlikely in the near future. Mr Major's pre-planned confrontation with Mr Paisley was intended to isolate his hardline Democratic Unionist party by demonstrating that threats and bluster will achieve nothing. Mr Major also wanted to provide a contrast between the DUP and the more constructive role played by Mr James Molyneaux's Ulster Unionist party. There were signs yesterday that the strategy was working. Mr Paisley compared Mr Major to Adolf Hitler, but ruled out taking his struggle to the streets. Mr Ken Maginnis, a senior UUP MP, accused Mr Paisley of 'harming the cause of unionism', confirming that the UUP will continue to go along with Mr Major. The big prize, however, is the prospect of a reciprocal ceasefire by the loyalist terrorist organisations. British ministers hope Mr Major's brusque rejection of Mr Paisley's attack on his integrity will reinforce the government's insistence that no secret deals have been done with the IRA. The indications are that the loyalist paramilitaries would probably call a halt to violence if fears of a 'sell-out' could be assuaged. Unionist leaders with paramilitary links warned yesterday that Tuesday's nationalist summit in Dublin was being interpreted by some as evidence of IRA influence. Officials in both capitals say that the peace process is at an extremely delicate stage and warn that an upsurge in loyalist violence or a republican refusal to clarify the ceasefire could cause a breakdown. Nonetheless, work is continuing on an inter-governmental 'framework' agreement, expected in the autumn, which will make detailed proposals for the future. If the ceasefire holds, that will be when the real tough talking starts. Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, told members of the Orange Order last night that there was no question of the British and Irish governments imposing a solution on the people of the province. He said in Belfast's Comber Orange Hall, that joint authority against the people's will would be incompatible with the principle of consent. A crowd of protesters gathered outside but the meeting ended without incident.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.     IEZ  Ireland, EC.   Industries:-  P9721 International Affairs.

0,FT944-4832 ,"FT944-4832 _AN-ELGCWAASFT 941207   FT  07 DEC 94 / Unhappy Irish await a new government      By JOHN MURRAY BROWN, Ireland Correspondent   Mr Albert Reynolds, Ireland's acting prime minister, in Budapest yesterday for the European security conference, was hoping for a dignified exit on perhaps his last appearance as premier on the international stage. His expectations were to be cruelly dashed. New revelations about his role in the unfolding judicial scandal that destroyed his government last month forced him to cut short his trip and rush back for yesterday's vital session of the Dail, the Irish parliament. With Mr Dick Spring, Labour leader, yesterday calling off his negotiations with Fianna Fail, it is widely believed that a general election is the only way out of the impasse. Mr Bertie Ahern, who succeeded as leader of Fianna Fail after Mr Reynolds was forced to resign as prime minister, publicly accepted that a fresh alliance with Labour was no longer an option. The latest breakdown follows allegations that Mr Reynolds misled parliament over the appointment of Mr Harry Whelehan from attorney-general to the post of president of Irish High Court. It emerged on Monday that a day after defending Mr Whelehan Mr Reynolds had tried to persuade him to resign. As the Dail prepared for yesterday's critical session, the mood was summed up by one Labour MP: 'Its lies, lies and damned lies.' The public mood is one of almost total shock. Ireland has already spent a month agonising over the role of the Catholic Church, its most hallowed institution, after the first allegations about bungled extradition of a paedophile priest, later convicted in Northern Ireland on child sex abuse charges. This has been followed by a political crisis which a nervous public fear may undermine efforts to achieve an elusive peace in Northern Ireland. There is little public enthusiasm for a general election whose campaign could take the country right into Christmas week. Only two days ago the three-week-old political crisis seemed close to a resolution. A new coalition between Fianna Fail and Labour seemed a foregone conclusion. The programme, inherited from the outgoing government, looked to be agreed. Both parties appeared committed to a high-growth strategy and to reducing the level of indebtedness. Fianna Fail and Labour seemed prepared to co-operate to co-ordinate policy on Northern Ireland. But now all this is to the hazard. The most immediate concern is that the crisis may hurt or slow down the Northern Ireland peace process. Dublin and London have yet to finalise the long-awaited framework document which is expected to form the basis for all-party talks on a new constitution for the province. It is also just a few days away from the first public meeting between UK officials and Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing. Efforts to avoid a Christmas poll continued yesterday. Mr Spring announced he was restarting talks with Fine Gael, the main opposition party. With Labour holding 32 seats and Fine Gael 47, there is an arithmetical possibility of a coalition with one of the smaller parties. Mr John Bruton, the Fine Gael leader, said yesterday that 'first of all we must get full facts out on the floor of the Dail'. With stronger leadership from Fine Gael, it is clear that the party could win broad support within parliament to lead a coalition with Labour. However, relations between Mr Spring and Fine Gael are not good, and a new accommodation may prove difficult in practice. The smartest political punters in Dublin appear to be laying their bets on a Christmas election.   Countries:-  IEZ  Ireland, EC.   Industries:-  P9199 General Government, NEC.

He said the other five Labour party ministers would also quit the Fianna Fail-led government after he accused Mr Albert Reynolds, the prime minister, of misleading the Dail, the Irish parliament, about the handling of a child sex abuse case. A government confidence motion expected in the Dail this morning is now likely to be defeated. The political uncertainty, amid speculation that the country could be forced to an early elections, has cast a deep shadow over progress on the Northern Ireland peace process. With a possible delay in forming a new administration, officials last night acknowledged the negotiations between London and Dublin on the framework document for a durable constitution would be put on hold. There was even the possibility that the crisis in Dublin could cause London to delay its undertaking to bring Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, into exploratory talks by Christmas. It almost certainly means the forced rescheduling of next week's planned Anglo-Irish conference on the peace process. Mr Spring's decision came at the end of a day of high political drama in which Mr Reynolds, in a last-ditch act of political contrition aimed at regaining Labour support, had admitted a mistake in appointing Mr Harry Whelehan, the attorney-general, as president of the High Court. Mr Whelehan has been under fire for his department's failure to act for seven months on a request from Northern Ireland to extradite a priest later convicted of child sex abuse by a Belfast court. Mr Reynolds last night seemed certain to go to President Mary Robinson to seek an early dissolution of parliament and an early general election. However, there was speculation that the president would use her powers under the constitution to force the parties to create a new coalition within the existing parliament. One factor is likely to be a wish to do as little damage to the peace process as possible. Some elements within Fianna Fail were last night pressing for Mr Reynolds to be replaced as leader ahead of the confidence vote, on the grounds that a change might avert defeat. The favourite to replace Mr Reynolds under those circumstances would be Mr Bertie Ahern, the finance minister. Dublin was in a sombre mood yesterday after Mr Reynolds had struggled to save his political career. In a 45-minute address to the Dail, Mr Reynolds offered what he called the 'full facts, the unvarnished facts' on the extradition case. He said he had acted unwisely in the appointment of Mr Whelehan. After three adjournments the Dail was in its fourth sitting when Mr Reynolds conceded his error in the appointment and said he was unware he had been given misleading information when he made a statement on Tuesday about the sex abuse case. But Mr Spring said that the new evidence had been in the prime minister's possession.

Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, said he was determined not to allow the process to be derailed by the killings in a bar in Greysteel, Co Derry. The initiative was rejected by Mr Peter Robinson, deputy leader of the hardline Democratic Unionist party, who warned that Northern Ireland was close to civil war. Terrorists from both sides have killed 23 people in the last two weeks in a cycle of violence triggered by last weekend's bombing of a shop in Belfast which killed 10 people. The violence continued yesterday when an RUC officer was wounded in Newry. Mr Reynolds said Unionists had 'nothing to fear' from the initiative launched by the British and Irish governments in Brussels on Friday. He said: 'As long as a majority of the people of Northern Ireland wish the present status to remain, that's the way it will be.' Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, said he hoped to set up a series of meetings with Unionist leaders, probably lasting up to 12 months. But Mr Robinson said the joint statement issued by the two prime ministers was 'an endorsement of the six-point plan for a united Ireland laid out last week by Dick Spring. 'Whoever it was aimed at, it was not aimed at Unionists because it is adopting a nationalist agenda.' However, ministers were heartened by the restrained reaction of Mr James Molyneaux, leader of the official Ulster Unionist party (UUP), who has made no public comment. The British government believes that constitutional guarantees and changes to parliamnetary procedures for Northern Ireland legislation may persuade Mr Molyneaux to take part in the talks. The government is moving to set up a Commons committee on Ulster, and may also scrap the use of non-amendable orders in council for Northern Ireland legislation. However, other UUP leaders remained wary. Mr David Trimble, the party's home affairs spokesman, said Mr Spring was guilty of 'self-deception.' Mr John Major is expected to make a statement on the peace initiative in the Commons today, probably as part of a wider report on the EC summit in Brussels. The prime minister is expected to distance the Anglo-Irish initiative from the peace proposals produced by Mr John Hume, leader of the nationalist SDLP, and Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA. Mr Hume said in a series of interviews that the SDLP/Sinn Fein proposals remained the best prospect for peace in Northern Ireland. He said it was 'difficult to accept' that the Hume-Adams proposals had been dismissed by the British and Irish governments. Mr Hume accused Mr Major of being unwilling to discuss the proposals. However, he said he would drop the proposals if he was convinced that he had become an obstacle to peace. 'If the prime minister tells me that he has a peace process with the Irish government that is going to produce a total cessation of violence, and he convinces me that my dialogue is stopping that, then obviously I am not going to be an obstacle to that,' he said. Downing Street said Mr Hume had not requested a meeting with Mr Major. However, the prime minister is willing to meet party leaders, including Mr Hume, at any time. The British government is determined not to be seen to be talking to the IRA through Mr Hume. Background, Page 7   Countries:-  IEZ  Ireland, EC.     GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

The three main opposition parties, Fine Gael, the Progressive Democrats and Democratic Left, have been concerned that Mr Reynolds, in pushing hard for an accommodation of nationalist aspirations in the joint declaration, would alienate unionist opinion in Northern Ireland and exacerbate political tensions and violence there. Ms Mary Harney, leader of the Progressive Democrats, who has been one of Mr Reynolds' sharpest critics, described the declaration as 'fair and balanced'. Mr Prionsias de Rossa, leader of Democratic Left, paid tribute 'to the drafting skills of some of the best brains in both the Irish and British public services'. Mr John Bruton, the Fine Gael leader, congratulated the two prime ministers on reaching an agreement. But he was concerned at a 'lack of clear timetables or mechanisms' for the resumption of inter-party talks and hoped the formula for dropping the republic's constitutional claim to Northern Ireland in the context of an overall settlement 'would not be used as an excuse to defer all action on constitutional reforms into the indeterminate future'. The declaration invited the unionists to suggest topics which 'can be represented as not being fully consistent with a modern democratic and pluralistic society' and offered to discuss and consider 'ways of removing such obstacles'. Mr Bruton warned against establishing too many bodies for discussing issues in the north. On the legislatively powerless Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, which unionists are to be invited to join, he said there should not be 'competing institutions trying to solve the same problem'. Mr Reynolds indicated yesterday, however, that the real objective of such a forum was to provide a further incentive for Sinn Fein to renounce violence.   Countries:-  IEZ  Ireland, EC.

The paper has angered the Democratic Unionist party. The paper confirms the Irish government's willingness to negotiate its territorial claim to Northern Ireland, but says important concessions will be required from Ulster's unionists in return. Mr Peter Robinson, deputy leader of the DUP, said yesterday: 'It is clear the message the Irish government wants to give is that it is digging in its heels.' He and the Reverend Ian Paisley, the party leader, walked out of the talks - which involve the British and Irish Governments and the four Ulster constitutional political parties - last week, saying that unless the Irish Republic 'realistically addresses' its territorial claim to Northern Ireland, they will not participate further. Mr James Molyneaux, the Ulster Unionist party leader, has warned that his delegates will also withdraw from the talks in the coming weeks if there is no indication of progress on this issue. Both parties want the Irish government to commit itself to a referendum to amend Articles Two and Three of the Republic's constitution. Mr Robinson said yesterday: 'We cannot have any relationship with the Irish Republic while they have a territorial claim over Northern Ireland.' The Dublin-based Irish Times published extracts from an Irish government position paper submitted to the talks on August 28. One extract says the Irish government 'does not rule out constitutional change resulting from the present negotiations' but adds that the Irish electorate 'will be particularly sensitive to the impact of any proposed amendment on the position of the nationalist minority in Northern Ireland'. It describes the minority as 'victims' of the Government of Ireland Act, which partitioned Ireland in 1920. The extract goes on to say: 'If as certain delegations have urged, proposals for constitutional change emerging from the negotiations were to include changes to the Irish constitution, the strength and quality of the link between both parts of Ireland would be one of the important factors in shaping the judgment of the electorate in this regard. 'Those who urge that the division introduced by the act should be endorsed by the nationalist community have a corresponding duty to say how the evident flaws of the original, purportedly temporary, provisions would be addressed' The Irish foreign ministry said: 'The talks are confidential and it is regrettable there should be continued leaks. It makes things more difficult for (participants) to reveal their positions if they think it is going to be published in the papers the next day.'

His remarks in a keynote speech, almost a month after the  signing of the declaration, seemed to undermine Mr Major's blunt  refusal to elaborate on the agreement.    Sinn Fein's demands for clarification have been repeatedly  dismissed by Downing Street, which has accused the IRA of  attempting to enter talks without halting its campaign of  violence.    Mr Major's tough line was endorsed yesterday by Mr James  Molyneaux, the Ulster Unionist leader.    Mr Molyneaux said: ""Practically every paragraph cancels  itself out.    ""Where you have a phrase or a sentence that is repugnant to  any pro-Union citizen, that is immediately cancelled out in the  same paragraph by a counterstatement.""    Mr Reynolds's speech to the Irish Association at Dublin  Castle was aimed at both nationalists and Unionists and was  clearly designed to keep the peace process alive.    He said the Downing Street document did not provide a  solution in itself, but was merely the ""first step on the road""  to peace.    He made a strong attempt to reassure Unionists, stressing  that a united Ireland could not be imposed in the absence of the  ""freely given consent"" of a majority of people in Ulster.    Mr Reynolds added: ""Likewise the democratic right of  self-determination by the people of Ireland as a whole must be  exercised with and subject to the agreement and consent of a  majority in Northern Ireland.""    He said: ""Both governments accept that Irish unity would be  achieved only by those who favour this outcome, persuading those  who do not, peacefully and without coercion or violence.""    An attempt to impose a united Ireland without the consent of  a majority of Ulster people would be a recipe for instability.    And he added: ""There can only be a mutual process of  demilitarisation through confidence building on all sides.  Continuing violence and conflict is not merely evil, it is  futile.""    Mr Reynolds said the declaration, for the first time gave an  ""explicit, rock-solid"" guarantee that if a majority in Ulster  wanted a united Ireland, Britain would uphold that wish.    He declared: ""The beginning of every new journey holds some  fears. These can be overcome. The priority must be the  protection of human life. We want everyone to choose the path  to peace and turn away from the cul-de-sac of violence.""    Britain also explicitly acknowledged and agreed to support  the right of the Irish people to come together in whatever form  they choose.    He added: ""British imperialist interest in Ireland is dead,  even if we still have to resolve some of its legacy.""    Mr Reynolds also said: ""I would appeal to those with whom  the ultimate decision for peace now lies. Do not let this  opportunity pass. Do not because of the weight of the past, or  because of very natural instincts, condemn the people of either  community to another generation of suffering.""    Mr Reynolds's speech was made against a background of  continuing violence.    The Ulster Freedom Fighters shot and injured a Roman  Catholic  man in West Belfast.    And the IRA was blamed for a mortar attack on a joint  police/Army base at Crossmaglen.     "
0,FT934-2917 ,"FT934-2917 _AN-DLLALAACFT 931211   FT  11 DEC 93 / Major and Reynolds edge closer to Ulster peace deal      By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor      BRUSSELS   Mr John Major and Mr Albert Reynolds last night kept alive the prospect of a pre-Christmas peace initiative designed to persuade the IRA to end its 25-year campaign of violence in Northern Ireland. Despite an admission by the two leaders that their second meeting in a week had failed to surmount remaining obstacles to a joint declaration, they held out the possibility that such a statement could be finalised within the next fews days. Amid conflicting reports of their encounter at the European summit in Brussels, Mr Reynolds was said to have been angered by Mr Major's refusal to move further in the direction of acknowledging the aspirations for a united Ireland of the nationalist community in Ulster. The Irish prime minister was said also to be frustrated at Mr Major's apparent refusal to persuade Unionist leaders that the peace initiative offered no threat to their present status. But both leaders appeared ready to acknowledge that the cost of a breakdown in their negotiations might well be a resumption of uncontrolled violence in Northern Ireland. So in a public statement after their talks, Mr Major and Mr Reynolds said that further progress had been made and that they expected another meeting would be held before Christmas at which they could finalise the declaration. Senior British officials insisted it was still possible the statement could be agreed by Tuesday or Wednesday of next week. The British and Irish prime ministers want the statement to provide a springboard for an intensive round of negotiations on a permanent political settlement in Northern Ireland. More immediately, they hope it will coax the IRA into extending its traditional Christmas ceasefire into a permanent cessation of violence. But the two leaders have yet to find the precise language for the most sensitive passages in the document. They also remain uncertain that the first attempt since the 1985 Anglo - Irish agreement to balance the competing claims of Irish nationalism and Ulster unionism would be enough to restore peace. The joint statement issued after the talks said Mr Major and Mr Reynolds hoped 'to bring the process to a successful conclusion' in the next 10 days. With Mr Major anxious to secure an accord before parliament breaks on Friday for the Christmas recess, one high-ranking British official commented: 'I very much hope we get there. I cannot guarantee that we will get there.' He then added: 'There is still some way to go.' Officials will attempt to iron out the remaining differences during intensive contacts over the next few days, opening the possibility of a final summit in London next week. Anxious to reassure the Ulster Unionists, British officials said the declaration would underwrite its guarantee to the Protestant majority in Northern Ireland that there could be no change in the status of the province without their consent. Mr Major had also won assurances from Mr Reynolds of Dublin's commitment to drop its constitutional claim to Northern Ireland as part of a comprehensive settlement. But Mr Reynolds is determined those assurances to the Unionist majority must be balanced by public recognition of the legitimacy of the nationalist aspiration for a united Ireland.

In a letter to about 1,000 prominent Conservatives including the prime minister, Mr Leonard Fee, the senior unpaid Tory in the province, claimed Mr Major could 'destroy us all' by allowing himself to be enticed by 'media-hype, Irish blarney' and 'honeyed words'. His warning emerged as the government moved to reassure Unionists on the Major-Reynolds initiative by signalling that it may decide to give the go-ahead for a Northern Ireland parliamentary select committee within the next month. Under current plans, clearance for the committee could be given as a gesture of reassurance to Unionists if London succeeds in agreeing a joint declaration with Dublin to persuade the IRA to give up its campaign of violence. It is thought that a government undertaking to set up a body which has been long sought by Unionists would make them less likely to reject text that emerges from the Major-Reynolds process. An early decision to press ahead with the committee would risk antagonising nationalists, however. Mr John Hume, leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party, warned this week that such a move could endanger the Ulster talks process. London and Dublin are voicing mounting confidence that a joint declaration can be agreed before Christmas. Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, yesterday gave cabinet ministers their first briefing on last Friday's Dublin meeting between Mr Major and Mr Reynolds. In his letter to fellow Tories, Mr Fee, chairman of the party's voluntary wing in Ulster, said: 'If the government agrees to any form of devolved legislative government for Northern Ireland, it will be ensuring the break-up of the United Kingdom. 'The impression is given that 'talks' are designed to produce a solution which will appease the IRA. We do not see how this can be done without going back on the guarantees about Northern Ireland's place in the United Kingdom  -nothing less would satisfy the IRA.' He said last night that the letter - which he cleared with the Conservative Northern Ireland area council which he chairs - had produced favourable responses from a 'significant' number of Tory MPs. There was further reassurance for Unionists last night when Mr Andrew Hunter, the pro-Unionist MP for Basingstoke, beat Mr Peter Temple-Morris, MP for Leominster, for the chairmanship of the Tory backbench Northern Ireland committee. In Dublin, a spokesman for the Irish government said it was prepared to make a written commitment to downgrade its territorial claim to Northern Ireland to an 'aspiration' as part of an overall settlement package.

They believe Sinn Fein, the political wing of the provisional IRA, will have to be drawn into talks once it has renounced violence to make a political settlement possible. Interviews over the past week with executives at the top 50 companies in Northern Ireland found most broadly support London and Dublin's efforts to reach a settlement. They warned that failure would risk an upsurge of violence with damaging consequences for the economy. A number of the province's leading businessmen believe that an eventual unification of Ireland could be acceptable if there are economic and business dividends from a peace settlement. Business leaders in Northern Ireland have traditionally been reluctant to be drawn into the political debate for fear of becoming targets of terrorist attacks. Their decision to break their silence underlines the importance attached to peace efforts at a time when businesses are threatened by terrorism on the one hand and recession on the other. Sir George Quigley, chairman of Ulster Bank, said: 'The two governments should work closely together and all concerned grasp the sense of urgency . . . there is a need to act now and not just drift for another 12 months which would lead to a repetition of the violence of the last 25 years. This is a turning-point.' Mr Edward Wilson, managing director of Ulster Carpets, said there was a great desire for peace. 'I would be quite happy as an industrialist to work in a united Ireland or within the UK . . . given the right political institutions and the right economic support from the EC, there is no reason why Ireland should not operate as a single political and economic entity.' Mr Trevor Campbell, managing director of Moy Park, a leading food processor, commented: 'No one is in any doubt that a cessation of violence would help the economic climate generally. I don't want a temporary ceasefire but a permanent one. If the government can get a devolved administration in Northern Ireland, this will help business.' Mr Georges Senninger, managing director of Montupet, a French motor components company based in Belfast, said: 'Every time we try and sell something the 'troubles' factor comes into play. The IRA is part of the landscape here, you have to take them into account. I don't think it is possible to have a political settlement without them.' Mr Alex Bell, director of Castlecourt Investments, which runs Belfast's main shopping centre, said: 'The government is totally on the right track by trying to bring about a settlement, although we cannot have peace at any price. It is inevitable that Sinn Fein will be included in the political process . . . but there is an essential criterion prior to that happening. This would involve the complete cessation of violence.' Mr Sean O'Dwyer, chief executive of Desmond and Sons, a Londonderry clothing manufacturer employing 2,700 people and the second biggest manufacturer in the province, agreed that Sinn Fein would have to be at the negotiating table 'but only after a cessation of violence'. Mr Ian Young, managing director of a Derry electrical contractor, said: 'I believe a united Ireland will eventually come about. Unionists should be negotiating from a position of strength now, to get the best possible terms and guarantees. Politicians are going to have to grasp the nettle and all will get stung.'

While firmly restating London's insistence on a permanent cessation of IRA violence, Sir Patrick aimed to encourage republicans to enter the peace process in a speech to the Foreign Policy Association in New York. He said an end to the armed conflict in Ulster was 'not going to require any surrender'. The recent three-day ceasefire was not enough, said Sir Patrick, and he made clear that any similar gestures - hinted at by Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president - would also be dismissed. He stressed that if Sinn Fein renounced its support for violence and delivered an end to armed action it would within three months join exploratory talks leading it to a full role in the democratic process. His remarks were being seen last night as recognition of the need to enable the republican movement to extract itself from violence without having to concede defeat. Downing Street insisted they did not change government policy 'one iota', however. The Downing Street declaration did not require any party to give up its aspirations or beliefs but simply to renounce violence as a means of pursuing them, it said. Sir Patrick's measured comments, in which he also acknowledged Sinn Fein's electoral mandate in the province, drew condemnation from unionists. Mr David Trimble, Ulster Unionist MP for Upper Bann, said the speech undermined the government's integrity and would create 'confusion and alarm' among Ulster's law-abiding majority. Mr James Molyneaux, the UUP leader, said the remarks were 'ill-judged'. Mr Nigel Dodds, secretary of the Democratic Unionist party, said he was alarmed that Sir Patrick should send signals to terrorists saying they need not surrender. 'It confirms our view that the government is not in the business of seeking to defeat the IRA at all,' he said. The speech was given a qualified welcome by Mr Tom Hartley, national chairman of Sinn Fein, who said it appeared to recognise 'the reality that there will be no unilateral surrenders by any side'. Mr Seamus Mallon, deputy leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party, also welcomed Sir Patrick's remarks, saying they were in accordance with the declaration. Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, said he had always maintained there was no question of a military victory or a military defeat for either side. The road to a just solution could be 'long, slow and painful,' he acknowledged.

After a day of non-stop telephone diplomacy between the British and Irish prime ministers, Whitehall officials said the statement would be released after a Downing Street meeting between the two leaders this morning. With only a few minor differences remaining to be settled, Mr Major expects to spell out the accord in the House of Commons a few hours later. He was last night also considering the possibility of a prime ministerial broadcast to outline the details to the people of Northern Ireland. The declaration, designed to reconcile the competing interests of the province's unionist majority with the aspirations of Irish nationalists will be hailed by both leaders as the best chance since 1968 for an end to terrorism. Mr Reynolds and the Irish foreign minister, Mr Dick Spring, briefed a specially convened cabinet meeting late last night on the joint declaration. The cabinet fully endorsed the document in its final draft form. The Whitehall officials said that the document would underline the 'irrelevance' of the military campaign being waged by the IRA to secure a united Ireland. British intelligence reports suggest the leaders of the IRA and Sinn Fein, its political wing, are already embroiled in a fierce argument over whether to end the campaign. The statement will also provide the springboard for the relaunch of talks among the constitutional parties aimed at restoring devolved government to Northern Ireland. But even as Mr Major and Mr Reynolds were clearing the remaining obstacles, some leading unionist politicians were questioning if the declaration would bring lasting peace. The statement will include a firm guarantee to the Protestant majority in the province that its status as part of the UK could only be changed with their consent. It will also signal Mr Reynolds' willingness to drop the Republic's constitutional claim to the north in the event of a permanent political settlement. But in return Mr Major has agreed to language in the declaration which goes further than hitherto in acknowledging the aspirations of those seeking a united Ireland. He has accepted wording affirming the right of 'self-determination' for 'the people of Ireland, north and south'. The statement will also underline that the British government has no 'selfish or strategic interest' in keeping Northern Ireland within the UK if a majority of its people were to vote for unity with the Republic. Despite the strong affirmation of the veto on any constitutional change wielded by the majority, such phrases could provoke an angry reaction among unionists. Mr Reynolds, who has said he would not accept any declaration which did not offer a reasonable prospect of an end to the IRA campaign, also appears to have won agreement on the establishment of a new Irish convention. Mr Major will stress that the convention, designed to provide an early opportunity for Sinn Fein to join talks, will not have any real authority. He appears to have succeeded in removing from the communique a call for parallel referendums in the north and south. But the precise phrases in this section of the communique will be critical in determining the impact of the declaration. If they move too far in the direction of Sinn Fein, they will threaten a unionist backlash against Mr Major's government and its fragile majority at Westminster. That in turn could trigger a renewed escalation in the terrorist campaign being waged by Protestant paramilitaries. Officials acknowledged last night that the two leaders were uncertain if the statement would persuade the IRA to abandon its military campaign. One British minister said it might mark the 'beginning, not the end' of the search for peace. An important figure in the moderate Ulster Unionist party, whose support will be essential, was less sanguine. He predicted the declaration would be a 'mish-mash with one bit of it contradicting the other'. Mr Spring was optimistic about the prospects for peace. He said: 'I believe peace is possible in a very short period of time . . . the intention (of the joint declaration) is to lead to a cessation of violence and with that our hopes go.'

But after a fresh round of talks between Mr John Major and Mr Albert Reynolds, the two leaders were forced to acknowledge there were several remaining obstacles to an agreement which would usher in a new era in Anglo-Irish relations. Despite these difficulties, the two leaders hope to meet again in London before Christmas to pursue an agreement. During talks at the European Union meeting in Brussels, the British and Irish prime ministers agreed the statement should act as a springboard for an intensive round of negotiations on a permanent political settlement in Northern Ireland. More immediately they hope it will coax the IRA, through its political wing Sinn Fein, into extending its traditional Christmas ceasefire into a permanent cessation of violence. Officials on both sides, however, admitted the two governments had yet to find the precise language for the most sensitive passages in the document. They also remained uncertain that the first attempt since the 1985 Anglo-Irish agreement to balance the competing claims of Irish nationalism and Ulster unionism could restore peace. After an hour-long meeting the two leaders issued a brief joint statement saying they had made further progress towards agreement on the text of the declaration. They would meet again before Christmas to bring the process to a conclusion. With Mr Major anxious to secure an accord before parliament breaks on Friday for the Christmas recess, one high-ranking British official commented: 'I very much hope we get there. I cannot guarantee that we will get there.' He then added: 'There is still some way to go.' The two governments will attempt to iron out the remaining differences during intensive contacts over the next few days, opening the possibility of a final summit meeting in London on Tuesday or Wednesday. Anxious to reassure the Ulster Unionists, British officials said the declaration would underwrite its guarantee to the Unionist majority in Northern Ireland that there could be no change in the status of the province without their consent. Mr Major had also won assurances from Mr Reynolds of the Irish government's commitment to drop its constitutional claim to Northern Ireland as part of a comprehensive political settlement. The joint declaration will repeat the offer to Sinn Fein of a place at the negotiating table in response to a total cessation of terrorist activities. There were signs, however, of continuing disagreement over Dublin's demand for an all-Ireland convention open to all constitutional parties from the North and South.

In a veiled warning to the government he said Ireland's traditional cycle of one paramilitary force replacing another could recur if there was no progress towards peace. He told the Boston Herald newspaper during his US visit: 'None of us can say two or three years up the road that if the causes of conflict aren't resolved, that another IRA leadership won't come along. Because this has always happened. The history of Ireland is filled with phases of armed struggle and then of quiet.' Mr Adams, who is on a tour of the US, tempered his warning with a reaffirmation of his hope there would be a lasting peace. 'I want to see the gun taken permanently out of British politics. I mean that is our intention. Who's interested in temporary? We live there.' Mr Michael Mates, the former Northern Ireland minister sent by the government to shadow Mr Adams's tour, said the Sinn Fein leader's remarks about a permanent peace 'take us a little further. I happen to believe that the intention is that the end should be permanent, but he cannot say it'. The government has promised to start preliminary talks on how to admit Sinn Fein to the political process within three months of a permanent end to IRA violence. David Owen writes: Conservatives from Northern Ireland are moving to rock the boat before next month's Tory conference by urging the party 'actively to persuade' the people of the province that their best future lies within the UK. They are trying to force a vote on this by canvassing support among Tory constituency organisations. Their amendment to the motion on Northern Ireland that will be debated at the conference also calls for the deletion of a reference to the courage of Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister. A letter to constituency chairmen from Mr Leonard Fee, the senior unpaid Tory in the province, argues that it would be 'distasteful to ask the party conference to praise Mr Reynolds'. Tory party rules vest the 'absolute right' to decide whether to call amendments with the conference chairman, making it unlikely the Northern Ireland amendment will be voted on. However Mr Fee, chairman of the Tories' Northern Ireland Area Council, believes the party's high command could be embarrassed if a significant number of constituencies write in to express their support. He points out that although most motions submitted on Northern Ireland are concerned with 'strengthening the union and governing Northern Ireland as the rest of the United Kingdom,' these sentiments are not reflected in the motion selected for debate.

The move was seen as an attempt to placate Unionists  following their threat earlier this week to boycott cross-border  talks on the future of Northern Ireland, though the committee  was promised several months ago. But it angered Ulster's  nationalists and also threatened a row between the Government  and Labour over who sits on the parliamentary body. Mr Tony  Newton, Commons leader, tabled a motion for debate next week  setting up the committee -- which has long been sought by  Unionists and was suspected to be at the centre of a deal with  Mr Major last summer to secure support over Europe.    On the same day, the Commons will be asked to give its  annual  approval for renewing the Prevention of Terrorism Act -- which  will again put Labour on the spot as it opposes the legislation.    Ever since direct rule was imposed in 1972, Unionists have  objected to the way Northern Ireland business is handled at  Westminster without any effective monitoring by MPs.    The Government had resisted a select committee for Northern  Ireland, fearing it would degenerate into a sectarian squabble.  But ministers have judged the time is now right to establish  the group to bolster recent efforts to broker a settlement among  the political parties.    Nationalists have long harboured suspicions about a select  committee, which they see as an attempt to tie Northern Ireland  closer to the Union and cutting across efforts to win an agreed  settlement among all the parties.    Mr Seamus Mallon deputy leader of the SDLP [Social  Democratic  and Labor Party], said in the Commons yesterday that the  committee was being imposed against the wishes of a substantial  group of MPs.    Ministers, however, do not anticipate any boycott of the  committee, though they envisage fierce arguments over the  composition. The Government wants an overall majority, in  keeping with the convention that select committees should  reflect the balance of power in the Commons. But with none of  the main parties represented in Northern Ireland, the issue has  become complicated.    The committee is to have 13 members -- six Conservatives two  Labour, two Ulster Unionists, one Democratic Unionist, one  Nationalist SDLP and Sir James Kilfedder, the lone Popular  Unionist, who could be chairman and would ordinarily vote on the  Government side.    Labour is unhappy with such a balance, arguing that it  breaches all the rules of select committee composition set down  since 1979. They also want the chairmanship. A possible  compromise could be a 15-strong committee, retaining an overall  Government majority but giving Labour more seats.    The Government disputes any suggestion that the select  committee cuts across the three-strand talks process it is still  pursuing despite recent setbacks.    Earlier this week, Mr James Molyneaux, Ulster Unionist  leader, said that he did not see any future in talks involving  Dublin and that he wanted to concentrate on winning agreement  for new forms of government in the province.    However, he has not broken off contact with the Government  and further meetings are planned between the Unionists and Mr  Michael Ancram, Northern Ireland Minister, who is trying to find  common ground. Realistically, ministers do not expect any  movement on the talks process until after the European election  on June 9.     "

Nationalists in both countries see the Ulster peace talks as the trigger for a campaign to highlight the contradictions between the government's approach to Northern Ireland and its handling of Scotland and Wales. Nationalists intend to contrast the government's reluctance to acknowledge peaceful demands for Scottish and Welsh devolution with its willingness to negotiate with Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, if the Northern Ireland ceasefire holds. Mr Dafydd Wigley, president of Plaid Cymru, the Welsh nationalist party, yesterday stepped up the campaign at the party's conference in Llandudno, appealing to Mr John Major to recognise that Ulster and Wales have equal rights to self-determination. 'In the name of democracy, consistency and political justice, I appeal to the prime minister to recognise the morally indefensible position of denying these self-same rights to the people of Wales,' he said. 'If John Major can tell the people of the six counties of Northern Ireland that if it is their wish, democratically expressed, that they can unite with the Irish Republic . . . by what token can he deny that self-same degree of sovereignty to the people of Wales and of Scotland?' The issue was raised in the Commons on Thursday by Mr Alex Salmond, leader of the Scottish National party, in a barbed intervention at prime minister's question time. Congratulating Mr Major on the apparent success of his Northern Ireland policy, Mr Salmond pointed out that it hinged on the right of the people of Northern Ireland to determine their own future. 'For the avoidance of any doubt, will you confirm that you also believe in the right of self-determination for the Scottish nation?' he asked. Mr Major, who fell back on claims that devolution would raise taxes, appeared to have no answer to a line of questioning that promises to become increasingly embarrassing for the government.

He emphasised that the discovery at the weekend of an unexploded semtex bomb in Enniskillen showed the importance of the IRA decommissioning its armoury before Sinn Fein was brought into round-table political talks on the future of the province. 'What the planting of this device shows precisely is why it is so important to deal with the problems of weapons and explosives.' Referring to yesterday's bilateral contacts with Sinn Fein, Mr Major commented: 'We have always made clear that there can be no question of political representatives of paramilitary organisations entering the political process until they have a commitment to exclusively peaceful methods  - and have demonstrated that commitment to exclusively peaceful methods.' The prime minister would not specify how Britain would react to the decommissioning of the IRA weapons stockpile. But he expressed hopes that continued peace would bring further gradual moves in security and policing operations in Northern Ireland. 'Both the government and the Royal Ulster Constabulary would like to move to wholly civilian policing . . . that is going to take some time but it is a clear objective.' In a response to suggestions from Mr Albert Reynolds, Mr Bruton's predecessor, that Britain had conceded the creation of a new cross-border institution with executive powers, Mr Major said: 'There is no question of joint authority, which is what worries the people of Northern Ireland.' Mr Major stressed that, once completed, the framework document would be a basis for discussion among the Northern Ireland parties, not a blueprint for a new political settlement imposed by the British and Irish governments. Any new arrangements would require the consent of the people and would be submitted eventually to a referendum. 'If we have learnt anything about the Northern Ireland problem over recent years it is that you have to carry the people of Northern Ireland with you,' Mr Major said. 'We must earn and keep their trust and they must be clear that there is nothing going on that would unsettle either main tradition . . . So those people who are thinking: 'Gosh, there is some murky work at the crossroads' are wholly wrong.' Mr Major expected today's meeting with Mr Bruton to be an informal discussion. He said it was too early to say whether the document would be completed in January. 'We will move ahead as speedily as we can. There are still some difficult issues to be determined. I think they are determinable but it will take a little while.'   Countries:-  IEZ  Ireland, EC.     GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P9721 International Affairs.

The Irish cabinet was briefed yesterday afternoon by Mr Albert Reynolds, the prime minister, and Mr Dick Spring, the foreign minister, who through informal channels have been informed of the latest developments in republican thinking. After the meeting a government spokesman said: 'We are hopeful that what we are going to hear will be a permanent cessation of violence.' He said that Dublin's understanding of the announcement was that it would be permanent. The spokesman added: 'There are no pacts, no deals and no terms. They are making their decision in the light of the current political situation.' Mr Reynolds said last night: 'I believe we are poised for peace and that in a very short time we will be able to make an entirely new beginning in the island . . . a complete cessation of violence and the principles of the Downing Street declaration are our new starting point.' The growing hopes follow Monday night's comments by Mr Gerry Adams that he had told the IRA leadership he believed the time was right for a truce. Mr John Hume, the leader of the mainly Roman Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party who held talks with Mr Adams at the weekend, said yesterday: 'Our objective is a total cessation of violence and surely everybody wants to see that.' Dublin now has a delicate balancing act to play in the event of an IRA ceasefire. It must try and reassure the Northern Ireland unionists that they are not about to be forced into a united Ireland. At the same time Dublin must also reassure Sinn Fein and the IRA that a permanent cessation of violence will bring a rapid incorporation of Sinn Fein into negotiations through the Forum of Peace and Reconciliation, as laid out in last December's Downing Street declaration. The aim of the forum will be to bring together the different strands of nationalism throughout Ireland and attempt to create a united front for future all-party negotiations. A statement by Mr Reynolds last Sunday clearly alluded to this. He said: 'It remains my view, both as Taoiseach (prime minister) and as leader of Fianna Fail that in the longer term a united Ireland achieved by agreement offers the best and most durable basis for peace and stability.' He went on to rule out any return to 'majoritarian rule' in Northern Ireland. The tone of that statement is being seen as a firm message to Sinn Fein that the nationalist agenda will be vigorously pursued by the Irish government, the SDLP and Sinn Fein, in the event of an end to violence. That scenario has alarmed unionists however, who are already divided in their approach to the peace process. They fear that a deal has been done between London and Dublin, and that they will be left isolated. In an attempt to allay these fears, the Irish government, Mr Hume and Mr Adams have all stressed in recent days that any future constitutional changes in Northern Ireland would require agreement with the unionists through a process of negotiation and dialogue.

Speaking in Dublin to businessmen from both sides of the border, his comments were made in response to recent criticisms from Unionists in Northern Ireland that the current bilateral talks between the two governments are aimed at establishing a joint authority. Mr Spring said that a joint authority 'is not on the Irish government's agenda'. Deeper economic co-operation, however, would be encouraged. It would be 'realistic' to double current cross-border trade of IPounds 1.3bn (Pounds 1.28bn) a year to IPounds 3bn. In spite of deep political divisions 'there are very few who will contest the view that Ireland makes sense as a single economic area,' said Mr Spring. The Irish government wanted 'strong, meaningful and dynamic' cross-border structures to promote this goal and the two governments were looking at the prospects for co-operation in transport, health, energy, trade and tourism 'and other areas'. He said the continuing violence imposed a 'huge burden' on both the UK and Irish economies and impeded progress in economic co-operation. It was imperative 'that those who engage in violence on both sides should cease to inflict this intolerable burden on their fellow citizens'. Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, has meanwhile been pouring cold water on growing expectations of an extended IRA ceasefire in the summer or autumn. Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, said: 'The present intense speculation . . . is unhelpful and misinformed'. He added: 'Peace is not simply an IRA ceasefire. The peace process must address all of the issues which lie at the heart of the conflict.' These included a lifting of the broadcasting ban on Sinn Fein, an end to 'economic inequalities' for Roman Catholics and 'the speedy release' of all long-term IRA prisoners. Sinn Fein is due to give its definitive response to the Downing Street declaration within the next two to three weeks.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.     IEZ  Ireland, EC.

Senior Irish cabinet ministers say Sinn Fein could be brought into the forum 'very quickly' after an announcement. This would be before the exploratory talks the British government has offered the party, which would start after a three-month 'quarantine'. The ministers also echoed the British government's view that surrender of IRA weapons would not be a precondition to Sinn Fein's involvement in talks. Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish premier, told the Dail yesterday: 'The joint declaration was the first stage in the peace process. The Forum for Peace and Reconciliation could be absolutely vital to reaching a second stage, and to achieving a permanent cessation of violence. 'If we want to be realistic, we have to guarantee that there will be a political process, once violence is permanently ended. The forum could provide a useful input to wider negotiations.' The creation of such a forum was one of the main sticking points in the drafting of the joint declaration. Irish government officials say it was therefore decided to make it an Irish initiative, rather than a joint initiative with Britain. Mr Reynolds said the forum would be open 'to democratically mandated parties to provide a means to debate and devise appropriate alternative political strategies to violence'. Apparently acknowledging that unionists will not initially wish to be involved, he said the debate would take place 'among all strands of nationalism and hopefully a wider range of opinion, (and) in the aftermath of a permanent cessation of violence, could be a very healthy exercise'. Mr John Bruton, leader of the opposition Fine Gael party, was cautious. 'A forum that does not contain representatives of both traditions cannot achieve the stated objective in the joint declaration to promote reconciliation.' The Irish parliament later backed the joint declaration without a vote at the end of a day-long debate in the Dail.   Countries:-  IEZ  Ireland, EC.     GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Mr Spring said in an interview that the Dublin Government  would want to build on a temporary IRA ceasefire to help Sinn  Fein ""inch away from violence.""    A Sinn Fein leader has told THE OBSERVER that if talks were  on offer, he believed the IRA ""would react quite positively.""  Pat Doherty, Sinn Fein's vice-president, said: ""Obviously,  it's an opening up of the whole peace scenario, and it is to be  welcomed, and it is to be explored and built upon.""    He added: ""If we see a real and genuine possibility of a  serious, all-encompassing peace process developing, then Sinn  Fein would be prepared -- in the correct scenario, without  preconditions being laid down -- to go to the IRA and put it to  them that they should facilitate this development.""    That had happened before, during the secret 1992 contacts  between British Government go-betweens and Sinn Fein, when the  IRA had been asked for, and had offered, a 10-day ceasefire.    If a temporary ceasefire did break the current deadlock, it  could help Dublin and Sinn Fein by-pass John Major, who appears  politically paralysed by his reliance on the Commons votes of  the Ulster Unionist Party [UUP], given the Government's slender  majority.    But Mr Doherty insisted that in the last analysis, Mr Major  was the problem.    ""It is the British Government that holds the power and has  the authority and no matter how well-meaning Dublin may be,  that's the reality that Sinn Fein has to look at. If they had  the political will, they could deliver.""    Nevertheless, if an IRA ceasefire became more enduring as a  result of Dublin talks, it is possible that troops could be  withdrawn to barracks -- because they are only on Ulster's  streets in response to the terrorist threat.    In his interview with NEW CENTURY, a new left-wing  quarterly,  Mr Spring said he did not see any short-term dramatic  development that would allow Sinn Fein to become involved in the  political process because, for that to happen, the IRA would  have ""to put down the guns.""    He then said: ""I see violence withering away rather than  being guillotined.""    But he added: ""I believe Sinn Fein is inching away from  violence. I am not even sure that they know what they are  inching towards. But I do believe they are inching away from  violence.""    Mr Doherty told THE OBSERVER: ""I am talking about inching  forward towards peace. As we inch towards peace, we have to  take on board the fact that there is violence coming from all  quarters; not just the IRA.""    Mr Spring said in his interview: ""I think they will try to  work out some kind of modus operandi that allows them to get  into political debate with Irish political parties before having  to make any concession to the British, before halting the  violence. We have to guard against that.""    But he then added: ""I think it is possible they will offer  some temporary cessation of violence in order to sit down round  the table with other nationalist parties.    ``They haven't done that yet, either publicly or privately,  but it seems that's the way their strategy is working. That's  going to pose a bit of a dilemma.    ``If they offer a temporary ceasefire we will want to find a  way of building on that without making any concessions to them.    ``All these processes are slow and painstaking, nothing is  going to happen that suddenly says to people, `It's over. Now  you can start to live your lives properly.''' Mr Doherty said  of the possible link between a temporary ceasefire and talks:  ``I think Sinn Fein would take it very seriously, but I could  not predict or tell you now what the outcome of that would be....    ``If it's serious and if it is perceived as moving the peace  process forward, I think that all that would be looked at  extremely seriously.''    Meanwhile, James Molyneaux, the Unionist leader, told a  Belfast meeting of his party council yesterday that December's  Downing Street declaration had run its course.    It had been suggested that the declaration could be  developed  or built on, and that it was only a starting point, but Mr  Molyneaux said: ""You can't hang much on a dead Christmas tree.""    However, Sir Patrick Mayhew, Secretary of State for Northern  Ireland, told a Conservative meeting in Sussex that the  declaration embodied fundamental principles of constitutional  and political reality.    ""They are principles that will endure. They are not  dependent on acceptance or rejection by Sinn Fein and the IRA.    ``For the two governments to have declared their common  acceptance of them is an event of historic significance.    ``They are now recommitting themselves to the political  talks  process which the Joint Declaration complements and underpins.''    But the interview with NEW CENTURY, to be published at  Easter, indicates that Dublin is still pursuing its own peace  agenda; the Heathrow attacks and continuing murders in the North  have not killed off their efforts to construct other  opportunities.

The rallies came only hours after one Britain's most wanted IRA suspects, Nessan Quinlivan, was arrested in Nenagh, Co. Tipperary, Charles Batchelor writes. Peace activist Susan McHugh took part in peace rallies in Belfast and at London's Hyde Park (above), each attended by about 2,000 people, and called for an end to terrorist violence. Mrs McHugh was at the centre of a 10,000-strong rally in Dublin last week after two children died in the Warrington bombing. Smaller peace rallies took place across Northern Ireland though up to 2,000 nationalists marched through West Belfast to protest against alleged security force violence.

Downing Street has acknowledged that the leak has damaged attempts by prime minister John Major and Mr Albert Reynolds, his Irish counterpart, to secure a comprehensive constitutional settlement, casting a pall over next month's planned Anglo-Irish summit in Dublin. Mr James Molyneaux, the Ulster Unionist leader, this week urged Mr John Major to stop looking for such a settlement, claiming the Dublin proposals offered 'structure that would bring about the unification of the Irish territory'. Dublin's move came as the IRA said it was committed to securing 'a just and lasting' peace, while accusing London and Dublin of 'playing politics' with the Irish issue. Using an article in its Republican News mouthpiece, the IRA sought to undermine recent suggestions it might be tiring of the armed struggle. The two governments should 'harbour no doubts about the determination with which we, our activists and supporters will apply ourselves to realising our objectives,' it warned. In London, Mr Seamus Mallon, deputy leader of the mainly Catholic SDLP, sought to inject momentum into the quest for a settlement by calling on the main protaganists to reject their entrenched positions and compromise. 'Peace is going to have to make all of us make concessions and bite our lips,' he said. Yesterday Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, offered fresh assurances to unionists about Dublin's intentions in efforts to reach a settlement. 'There should be no fears or suspicions among unionists. We are trying to end a very complex problem and bring about a situation where there is peace on this island and the people can live and work together as friendly neighbours. I just wish that people could see that and have talks on the basis of tolerance and respect.' He hit out at the perpetrators of last week's leak, branding them 'the real betrayers of both communities in Northern Ireland.'   Countries:-  IEZ  Ireland, EC.     GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

At a meeting in Rome, the WEU's foreign affairs and defence ministers will also sign agreements offering associate membership to Turkey, Norway and Iceland. But in a setback to the WEU's ambitions, Denmark and Ireland, both EC members, have agreed to observer status only. Mr Wim van Eekelen, WEU secretary general, said yesterday he hoped Denmark, a member of Nato, and Ireland, traditionally neutral, would become full members after a period of transition. France, Germany and some other members see the WEU as leading gradually to a common European defence policy under the political direction of EC governments as sketched out in the Maastricht treaty. Britain, however, has stressed the WEU's continuing close relationship with the Nato alliance. Mr van Eekelen said the WEU was fast becoming the European 'pillar' of the Nato alliance. A new planning cell will focus on peace-keeping, humanitarian aid, and crisis management and the WEU will move from London to new headquarters in Brussels. The Greek government sees WEU membership both as an extra security guarantee at a time of regional upheaval, and as confirmation that Greece will not be excluded from helping to shape future EC policy on security and defence. However, Greece had to make concessions during almost a year of negotiations, to ensure it would not exploit WEU membership as a guarantee against a perceived threat to its security from Turkey, a Nato ally. Under Article 5 of the pact, WEU members must assist each other if attacked. Greece has accepted, as a condition of joining, that the assistance clause cannot be invoked in a dispute between Nato members. Greece has also accepted Turkey's admission to the WEU as an associate member, with the right to participate in its activities. Turning to Yugoslavia, Mr van Eekelen said the WEU would strengthen the naval blockade in the Adriatic through stop-and-search operations on vessels suspected of carrying banned cargo to Serbia and Montenegro, in accordance with a UN security council resolution adopted this week. If a blockade had been enforced earlier, the Serbian bombardment of the historic town of Dubrovnik might have been prevented, he said. The WEU secretary general conceded that the Europeans had a 'credibility' problem in Yugoslavia, particularly in the light of recent failures to ensure food convoys reached their destinations in Bosnia-Hercegovina. Although he raised the possibility of dispatching troops under the WEU banner, he said this could not be done without a clear mission. 'No one wants to intervene massively in Yugoslavia.' A Turkish proposal to convene a meeting of Balkan countries to discuss the Yugoslav crisis was immediately rejected yesterday by Greece, writes John Murray Brown in Ankara. The Turkish move came in response to fears that recent violence in Macedonia and the Serb province of Kosovo could draw regional powers into the war. It was also aimed at countering criticism at home of the government's inaction in the face of Serb attacks on Moslems in Bosnia. At Geneva peace talks yesterday, Bosnia's rebel Serbs told international mediators that Croats, Moslems and Serbs could never again live together. In a draft constitution, the Serbs, who control 70 per cent of war-torn Bosnia, insisted the country must be split into three ethnic mini-states.  The Financial Times   London Page 2  "

He said tourist numbers to Northern Ireland rose last year for the fifth consecutive year. Final figures for have still to be compiled, but tourist inquiries and hotel occupancy rates showed increases over 1992 for the first half, with inquiries up 70 per cent. Last year the NITB launched a marketing campaign which, for the first time, used television advertising in the Republic of Ireland, Scotland and northern England. The NITN has also expandedoffice representation in Europe, North America and Australasia. Investment in the tourist industry in the province is estimated at Pounds 200m over the past five years. Mr O'Neil said: 'While much of this development has been provided by the public sector we expect it to be a stimulus to investment from the private sector in 1994, particularly in new accommodation.' In 1992, the last year for which complete figures are available, there were 1.25m visitors to Northern Ireland. One in five of these were purely for holiday purposes, 500,000 were visiting friends or relatives, while 500,000 were on business or for 'other purposes'. Larne, the main commercial and passenger port between the UK and Northern Ireland, reported a record of 1.8m passengers last year, an increase of 10.4 per cent. Car and caravan numbers rose 12.7 per cent to 414,000, while commercial vehicles rose to 364,000 and cargo handled reached 4.3m net tonnes, all breaking previous records. The government is to spend Pounds 2.5m refurbishing Northern Ireland's parliament building at Stormont in Belfast. The building, opened in 1932, needs work including new water and electrical services. The parliament was dissolved in 1972 when London introduced direct rule.

As cabinet ministers prepared for a meeting which is expected to pave the way for a positive but limited response to the cessation of violence, Mr Major told MPs that the issue of the IRA's armaments would be 'crucial' to the process. But, answering questions in the Commons, he appeared to suggest that initially at least, the government was prepared to differentiate between guns and explosives. He said: 'The question of armaments, and especially Semtex and detonators perhaps more than guns, are crucial issues that will have to be dealt with.' Downing Street officials subsequently rejected any suggestion that he was signalling that the IRA might be able to keep its guns. But senior unionists have raised the possibility that the surrender of IRA weapons might be staggered, with explosives and heavy weapons handed in first as they could be used only in an offensive capacity. The republicans might say that they need initially to hold on to their guns in case of a resurgence of loyalist terrorism. Sir James Kilfedder, the Ulster Popular Unionist, told Mr Major yesterday that until the terrorists handed over their arms and Semtex explosives there was a danger of them being used by breakaway paramilitary groups. Mr Ken Maginnis, the Ulster Unionist MP said: 'It is the IRA's intention at active service unit level to recommence their violence in the month of January or as soon thereafter as they believe they can do so.' The unionists estimate the IRA still has about two tonnes of Semtex as well as more than 1,000 high-velocity rifles and a range of heavy machine guns and rocket launchers. Mr Major and senior cabinet ministers are expected to agree as early as tomorrow to respond formally to the IRA ceasefire by announcing that it is the government's 'working assumption' that the violence has ended for good. That could pave the way for informal contacts before Christmas with Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, to discuss the terms under which it would be allowed to join talks on the province's future. But senior ministers privately acknowledge that the arms issue will be critical. Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, yesterday told the Dail, the Irish parliament, that peace negotiations could not be concluded until paramilitaries on both sides had handed over their arms. He said the government had made this point to Sinn Fein. Mr Major and Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, may hold a summit meeting this month to try to remove the obstacles that are still blocking the completion of a framework document to guide the talks process.

Word of the meeting - which would be the first ever between a Provisional Sinn Fein leader and an Irish premier - came as Mr Adams extended his list of demands by calling in Dublin for the withdrawal of British troops from nationalist areas. In Washington senior members of the US Congress warned that no extra money was likely to be available this year to help smooth the way to peace in Northern Ireland. But Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, said after a meeting with President Bill Clinton in the holiday resort of Martha's Vineyard that he hoped 'substantial' sums would be forthcoming. As Downing Street continued to voice doubts about the permanency of the IRA ceasefire, republican leaders rejected the possibility of a violent reaction to the killing by loyalist paramilitaries of a Roman Catholic man on Thursday. Mr Martin McGuinness, a member of Sinn Fein's governing executive, said it was 'a total anathema to us that anyone would consider taking any sort of retaliation for the deeds of a few people within the unionist community'. Mr Michael Ancram, Northern Ireland minister, responded to Thursday's loyalist attacks by pledging that the government would 'continue to pursue those who commit crimes of this sort'. Mr Reynolds met yesterday with Mr John Alderdice, leader of the non-sectarian Alliance party, to discuss the setting up of the Irish government's Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, which is intended to include Sinn Fein for the first time in round-table talks with other political parties. Dublin hopes to establish the forum - which unionist parties are expected to boycott - before the end of October. Officials said Mr Reynolds would be anxious to 'get things moving' before departing on a visit to Australia in two weeks' time. They said a meeting with Mr Adams was 'inevitable' before he leaves. In the US, Senator Patrick Leahy, chairman of the Senate appropriations committee which controls overseas aid, said money to smooth the peace process was already in the pipeline for next year, in the form of the US's Dollars 20m (Pounds 13.3m) contribution to the International Fund for Ireland. Mr Clinton said the US was 'prepared to take some steps to do whatever we can to help'.

The party's special conference yesterday failed to recommend that the IRA end its campaign of violence. Had it done so it is likely that Sinn Fein would have have been invited to join cross-party talks in the autumn. Mr Martin McGuinness, a member of Sinn Fein's governing executive, hinted after the conference that an IRA ceasefire could still be on the cards, enabling the peace process to continue. He said: 'Sinn Fein is working with others to bridge the gap. I want a situation where violence can be diminished - the IRA has to make a contribution.' Asked whether current conditions might be sufficient for the IRA to call a ceasefire, he said: 'I am not prepared to say whether they do or do not exist - it is an area we are working on.' Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, spoke in his closing speech of a 'climate of change' and indicated that he believed the IRA could be persuaded to end its violence 'if the proper conditions can be created'. He said the challenge for Sinn Fein was to 'create the conditions in which the IRA can act upon its clearly stated commitments and others will act upon their responsibilities so that a negotiated settlement can be agreed'. However it is clear that one of Sinn Fein's main priorities guiding its response to the declaration has been to avoid a split in its own ranks. One official said that the party, in arriving at its position, had travelled a long way. Mr Adams told the conference: 'I can assure you that we will endeavour with your help and guidance to achieve the political objectives which we have set ourselves. This struggle is united, confident and strong.' He stressed that the British government should now view the ball as being back in its court. He called on it 'to accept its responsibility to pro-actively create the conditions which will make this possible'. He added that de-militarisation was not 'a one-way street' and warned: 'Sinn Fein has a duty to our electorate north and south and we are commited to upholding their rights.' In a detailed breakdown of the party's criticisms of the declaration, the so-called unionist veto stands out as the biggest sticking-point. The conference stated that 'the veto is a barrier to the consideration or achievement of democratic options for all the Irish people. It has no legal, constitutional or democratic basis'. However another motion passed by the conference displayed Sinn Fein's optimism. It said: 'We have identified these negative elements in the Downing Street declaration in the hope that these difficulties can be overcome. Sinn Fein is convinced that, despite the inadequacies of the declaration, the potential to build upon a real peace process still exists.'   Countries:-  IEZ  Ireland, EC.

His announcement of a 'cautious peace dividend' will give a boost to the local economy before next week's International Investment Conference in Belfast. The announcement comes only four days before the planned opening talks between British government officials and Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing. The savings, which Sir Patrick announced with public spending plans for the province, represent cuts in the compensation paid for bomb and other terrorist damage to property and a planned reduction in the overtime bill of the Royal Ulster Constabulary. The savings will be reallocated to the education and health budgets. Spending on law and order, excluding army costs which are carried by the Ministry of Defence, comes to Pounds 889m a year. About Pounds 50m will be saved this year, rising to Pounds 60m in 1996-97 and a further Pounds 70m in 1997-98. RUC overtime currently costs Pounds 82m a year. Overall spending for Northern Ireland over the period is expected to remain fairly constant at Pounds 8bn in real terms. Sir Patrick warned, however, that the measures were contingent on the ceasefire being maintained. He emphasised that RUC staffing numbers would remain the same, and that recent security moves, such as reducing police and army presence on the streets, could be reversed 'within 24 hours'. Sir Patrick said: 'I hope that we are entering a new phase in the history of Northern Ireland. 'Peace, if it is seen to be established, will provide a chance for a fresh start for the people of Northern Ireland who for the first time in 25 years have had the opportunity to experience daily life free from the fear of violence.' Sir Patrick said there had been a 'substantial' number of acceptances of invitations to the investment conference. Invitations went out to all elected MPs and MEPs for the opening dinner. The government said that representatives from the economic committees in Belfast and Londonderry city councils had been invited to the working sessions. Sinn Fein seemed set to boycott the investment conference, however, saying it had been snubbed and demanding treatment equal to that of the other political parties. The row surfaced after it emerged that a full invitation to the dinner had been sent to Mr John Alderdice of the Alliance party, who is a local councillor and whose party has smaller electoral support than Sinn Fein. Government officials yesterday said the three Belfast Sinn Fein councillors, Mr Mairtin Muilleoir, Mr Joe Austin and Ms Una Gillespie, had initially indicated that they would attend the Wednesday sessions.

The letter urging Mr John Major, the prime minister, to end the stalemate by meeting Sinn Fein to clarify the Downing Street declaration was delivered on the first day of the IRA's three-day ceasefire. A Downing Street spokesman reacted cautiously and said the government might respond to Mr Adam's request for talks, which the Sinn Fein leader says would be aimed exclusively at clarification and not negotiation, 'in the next day or two'. Earlier in the day, however, Downing Street had reiterated the government's position: 'We are not negotiating with them and we are not going to clarify the joint declaration. They know what needs to be done; a renunciation of violence.' Mr Tom Hartley, Sinn Fein national chairman, yesterday denied that his party was in contact with the government - in spite of suspicions on the subject expressed by some unionist politicians. He said he was not aware that any part of the republican movement was in contact with London. With an extension to the IRA ceasefire - due to end at midnight tomorrow - highly unlikely in the absence of a positive government response, prospects for a breakthrough remain slim. Security forces in the province remain on full alert, in spite of the temporary suspension of violence, and there are fears that the end of the ceasefire will be met by an upsurge in paramilitary activity by republicans and loyalists. Mr Hartley, who was in London to deliver Mr Adams' letter, urged Mr Major to give an 'imaginative response' to what he described as an 'unprecedented initiative' by the IRA which demonstrated republican readiness to be flexible in the search for peace. He criticised the government's refusal to talk to Sinn Fein, given its readiness to do so from mid 1990 until late last year. 'When we raised points for clarification then, we got them very easily,' he said. 'It does seem odd the British are now saying 'no' at a time when there is a real possibility of political movement and a momentum being created.' Ms Lucilita Bhreatnach, Sinn Fein general secretary, said that Dublin had provided satisfactory clarification of the Downing Street document - but that ambiguities and uncertainties remained which London had to clear up. She declined to be more specific, saying it would be 'unhelpful' at this stage. Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, yesterday used a visit to Canada to deliver an upbeat message on the prospects for peace. He also reiterated the government's view that political violence had 'no place' in a democracy. In a speech at Montreal-based Bombardier Aerospace - owner of Short Brothers, Ulster's largest manufacturing employer - Sir Patrick said the Downing Street declaration would do much to bring about an end to terrorist violence. The people of Northern Ireland, like those of the Republic, rejected the concept of a three-day 'abstention from political violence'. Focusing principally on inward investment, Sir Patrick said that Ulster had accounted for 14 per cent of all new investment into the UK in 1992-93 in spite of having only 2.8 per cent of the population. Overseas investors recognised the 'essential normality' of conditions in Northern Ireland, he said.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P9721 International Affairs.

Sinn Fein  cannot complain that the declaration has not been clarified. It  has been explained time and time again by political leaders in  Ireland and Britain.    Today, in the Irish News, British Prime Minister John Major  makes an impassioned plea to Sinn Fein to accept the declaration  as the basis for a settlement of the problems facing this  country. It is one of the most significant contributions to the  debate since the declaration was unveiled in London in December.    Mr Major is not alone in hoping the Sinn Fein ard fhets [as  published] will take a permanent and courageous step towards  democracy. The declaration has gained the support of the  overwhelming majority of people in Ireland and in Britain; and  it is seen as the basis for peace with honour in other countries  sympathetic to the Irish cause.    The thrust of the party's policies over the past decade  makes  the final step to full democracy inevitable, its leaders realise  that; now its members must accept that their party can only play  a full and vital role in Ireland when their policy direction  reaches its logical conclusion.    One of the most important paragraphs in Mr Major's article  is  addressed directly to Sinn Fein. He says:    ""Sinn Fein claims not to understand the place of the  declaration in the `peace process'. There is nothing obscure  about this... The declaration is not a peace plan, it certainly  isn't a solution on its own. It is simply the view of the two  governments about the principles involved in a process leading  to an agreed outcome. Those central principles are democracy,  and an absence of coercion -- in other words consent, no outside  interference and an end to violence.""    The message to Sinn Fein is clear. No agreed outcome has  been pre-ordained by either government; and, if it rejects  violence, it will be able to play a full and unfettered part in  the debate which leads to that agreed outcome.    Today's article by Mr Major is couched in the language of  friendship and reconciliation. And he does not shy away from  some of the key concerns of the Sinn Fein leadership. He is  blunt on the issue of what he means by exploratory talks.    In his January 8 interview with the IRISH NEWS Mr Adams  asked  for clarification on what the exploratory talks would involve.  He asked if it meant more than just a discussion with Sinn Fein  about how the IRA could hand over its weapons. Mr Major says  clearly today that these talks would be meaningful.    ""We would be ready within three months of an end to violence  to begin an exploratory dialogue with Sinn Fein. Its aims would  be to discuss how Sinn Fein would become involved in the  three-stranded political talks, how they could be brought fully  into normal political life in Northern Ireland, and what the  consequences of ending violence would be... I believe this  amounts to a substantial exploratory agenda. Those exploratory  discussions would themselves be part of the process of bringing  Sinn Fein back into normal political life, in developing a  normal political dialogue between the government and other  parties, on matters like education, housing, health care, crime  and fair employment.""    That is a clear and positive statement which should  encourage  Sinn Fein to become involved, Mr Major is not just offering  talks on a narrow agenda.    Mr Major has also been unambiguous about the meaning of  self-determination, as he sees it. He re-emphasises his  government's position that it has no ""selfish, strategic or  economic interest in Northern Ireland"", and he goes on to say:  ""we would have no wish to frustrate the democratically expressed  wishes of the people.""    The primary policy objective of the British government, he  says, is ""to see peace, stability and reconciliation established  by agreement among all the people who inhabit the island.""    Britain wants to encourage agreement -- agreement which  would  include an input from Sinn Fein if it enters the democratic  process fully. And he pledges to introduce any legislation  necessary to give effect to that agreement which ""the people who  live in Ireland may themselves freely so determine without  external impediment.""    No Sinn Fein president could disagree with his comment ""it  is  not the government's job to tell the Irish people what they  should think or to dictate to them where their future should  lie.""    Rightly, Mr Major has said that the political talks -- on  the  three-strand basis which protects Irish interests -- must  continue. The opportunity for Sinn Fein must continue. The  opportunity for Sinn Fein to become involved is there. And he  takes up the theme of partnership both within Ireland and  between the British and the Irish. This aspect is critical if  we are to copper-fasten any agreement with economic  regeneration; and is particularly important in the context of  the two nations' membership of the European Union.    Calling for an end to violence, Mr Major spells out the  consequences: ""we shall in time be able to manage without  British soldiers in support of the RUC [Royal Ulster  Constabulary] and without emergency legislation""; greater  protection of civil rights; new institutions ""reflecting the  common interests in the island""; and closer partnership.    He does not try to limit or dictate the scope of agreement.  ""Whatever may be the shape of final agreement in the talks, it  will not be imposed on anyone. It will be the people who will  have decided.""    His acknowledgement that ""dreadful deeds have been done by  all"" is generous, as is his regret. His plea that ""our  generation must look to the future"" is one which should be the  motivating force for all those capable of advancing the cause of  peace in Ireland.     "

The disclosure by Mr Mitchel McLaughlin, Sinn Fein's northern chairman, came as the Northern Ireland Office announced that next week's talks with the IRA's political wing had been put back 48 hours to December 9 at Sinn Fein's request. Whitehall officials said last night that they had been given no explanation for the delay, beyond being told that the Sinn Fein delegation wanted more time to prepare. Meanwhile, it emerged that Mr McLaughlin is among six Sinn Fein councillors who have been invited to an important Belfast investment conference to be launched by the prime minister on December 13 and 14. It was initially decided that Sinn Fein would not be invited to attend the conference. But the government appeared to change its stance after several US institutions threatened to boycott it. Mr McLaughlin said Sinn Fein was 'prepared, perfectly prepared, to discuss the issue of the amount of weapons that are in circulation in Ireland, both legal and illegal'. But he said the weapons question had to be resolved in the context of discussions on 'the political conditions in Ireland and how we can replace those failed political structures with agreed political structures'. The British government wants the issue of paramilitary arsenals to be addressed in the preliminary talks due to begin next week and not in future political negotiations to which Sinn Fein and loyalist representatives may in time be admitted. Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, said yesterday that preliminary discussions 'must elicit proposals for the disposal of arms and explosives'. Mr John Major, the prime minister, used a speech to the Conservative Women's conference in London yesterday to confirm that the government would also begin talks with loyalist political representatives before Christmas.

The aim of the process is an agreed formula for self-rule in Northern Ireland, to replace the 1985 Anglo-Irish agreement. A month has been set aside for the current round of talks, which will include representatives from the four main political parties in the province as well as the British and Irish governments. Sir Ninian Stephen, the former governor-general of Australia, will chair the meetings. Preliminary discussions took place yesterday to agree an agenda, establish ground rules and organise a manageable negotiating structure. The discussions will involve three days of meetings each week, initially at Stormont Castle in Belfast, then moving to Dublin, probably in the last week of September. It will be the first time since partition in 1922 that Unionist political leaders have travelled on official business to Dublin. The talks are part of 'strand two' of the three-strand process. Talks in July were seen as a preliminary phase, during which the six groups laid out their positions and faced questioning by others. The real negotiations are now expected to get under way. Signs of flexibility will be sought - for example, whether the Irish government is prepared to relax or amend its constitutional territorial claim to Northern Ireland, and whether the unionist parties are prepared to concede some role for Dublin in a future Ulster administration. Strict confidentiality and a news blackout have been imposed on the discussions, as it is feared that any leaks before a final agreement is reached could endanger the talks. In spite of some breaches of confidentiality, there is a sense that progress has been made, if only to bring the main Ulster political parties together with the two governments. The three-strand political talks are based on a complex programme agreed by the participants in April last year. In 'strand one' local politicians discussed devolution in Northern Ireland with the UK government. In 'strand two' the Dublin government has entered the discussions on the relations between north and south Ireland. This round of talks is scheduled to finish by September 28, after which a new meeting of the Anglo-Irish conference, set up under the 1985 Hillsborough agreement, is due to be held. Unionist leaders refused to participate in the current talks unless the Anglo-Irish conference was suspended, which it has been since April.  The Financial Times   London Page 7  "

0,FT943-3937 ,"FT943-3937 _AN-EILDEABXFT 940912   FT  12 SEP 94 / PM confident Clinton will rebuff Adams      By TIM COONE   The government is confident that Mr Bill Clinton, the US president, will turn down a request to meet Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, who is expected to visit the US later this month. The Irish government is understood to believe that a meeting between the Sinn Fein leader and Mr Clinton would move the peace process forward. However, Downing Street, which is opposed to Mr Adams being granted a visa, has lobbied hard against any meeting with the US president which it believes would enrage unionists. It is confident that the US State Department has accepted its advice. Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, has revealed that it was a call from him to Mr Clinton which cleared the way for a US visa to be issued to Mr Joe Cahill, a veteran republican, on the eve of the IRA ceasefire. Mr Reynolds said he believed that the ceasefire would not have come about if the visa had not been issued to Mr Cahill. Meanwhile European Union foreign ministers were briefed in Germany by Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, and Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, on the peace process. Mr Hurd said the IRA would have to prove by 'words and deeds' that its ceasefire was permanent. Mr Spring said he believed the joint declaration signed in Dublin on Tuesday by Mr Reynolds, Mr Adams and Mr John Hume, leader of the mainly nationalist SDLP, proved that the Irish government's interpretation of the IRA ceasefire announcement was correct. 'As far as we are concerned, the leadership of the IRA has made a declaration, they have renounced violence and that is on a permanent basis,' he said. It was now up to the British government to respond positively by announcing its acceptance of the ceasefire. The province is already guaranteed nearly Pounds 1bn in EU aid and the Irish Republic Pounds 6bn in the next six years. But Mr Spring made clear that more must be done 'to meet the needs of the new situation'. The EU has already contributed about a third of the Pounds 230m made available so far to the International Fund for Ireland, set up after the Anglo-Irish agreement in 1989 to support peace initiatives through job-creation schemes and other aid. The call for more cash won the approval of the other foreign ministers, who instructed the European Commission to draw up plans for extra funding in consultation with London and Dublin. However, final proposals are not expected to be ready until December. Mr Hurd tried to reassure unionists that they had nothing to fear from the peace process. He said: 'I hope they will recognise that it is a straightforward decision by the IRA that the armed struggle is not working, it is not producing results and that they should abandon it as prescribed in the Downing Street declaration.' He also indicated that there would be no early lifting of the broadcast ban on Sinn Fein.   Countries:-  IEZ  Ireland, EC.     USZ  United States of America.

0,FT934-5913 ,"FT934-5913 _AN-DK1ACABLFT 931127   FT  27 NOV 93 / IRA hardliners set peace deadline: A deal might bring political gains to republicans. But, they could also face threats to their morale      By TIM COONE and JIMMY BURNS      BELFAST   Republican sources say that hardliners in the IRA are giving the peace initiatives less than a month before they publicly blame the British government for their failure and declare the process dead. IRA leaders are reported to be weighing the political gains which could spring from a comprehensive agreement between Dublin and London against the risks to internal discipline and morale posed by the current reduction in activity which has, as yet, produced no political breakthrough. Mr Mitchell McLaughlin, a Sinn Fein leader and a leading republican political strategist, said this week: 'This situation could change tomorrow with the IRA using another bomb to signal they are back on the offensive . . . The war is still going on . . . and the bombing campaign could easily be resumed. This peace initiative is not open-ended. It is finite. There's no way it is going to develop into an indefinite ceasefire if London and Dublin do not move forward.' An uneasy lull in the violence after the recent atrocities has created a crucial breathing space in which the peace process embarked on by the British and Irish governments can develop. But there is also a growing belief that time is running out, and that should talks fail there may be a surge in violence which will match, and possibly exceed, the worst levels of the past 25 years. Nevertheless the IRA has scaled down its operations since the bomb on the Shankill Road in Belfast and the loyalist gun attack on a pub in Londonderry. This has been matched by a scaling down of army operations. Army tactics also seem to have changed. 'Target acquisition', where soldiers train loaded guns on passers-by in republican areas, and the 'bomb burst' where soldiers burst out of armoured vehicles and rush through the streets covering each other with their weapons, are no longer employed. In a more subtle de-escalation soldiers have tended to wear berets rather than helmets in less dangerous areas. Security sources also suspect that the IRA's military capability may have been temporarily weakened by a recent series of discoveries of arms caches in the UK and the Republic of Ireland, and that a certain war-weariness may be behind the push for a peace settlement. But they do not doubt the IRA's own claims this week that it is still capable of striking heavily should a decision be made to resume action. According to security sources any resumption of a high-intensity military campaign by the IRA will almost certainly involve renewed attacks on commercial targets on the mainland. They say the IRA remains convinced that the bomb attack on the City of London in April was a major coup and that something similar should be attempted if the government seems to put Northern Ireland in the political background again. Sinn Fein has not yet written off the peace initiative between Mr John Hume, leader of the Social Democratic Labour Party, and Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, in spite of its rejection by Dublin and London. Sinn Fein believes that either the Anglo-Irish summit pencilled for next Friday or even informal contacts might produce key concessions facilitating a permanent ceasefire. Mr Tom Hartley, the Sinn Fein chairman, said: 'The process is not over yet. Politics is about looking for opportunities. I suspect the British government has no viable alternative to the Hume-Adams proposals and is just saying no . . . I will be looking for whatever emerges from the summit that can create a dynamic for change.' He added: 'It is possible that a response would not even happen at a public level but will probably be made in a private way,' suggesting that Sinn Fein hopes to reopen a secret channel of negotiation with the British government which it claims was closed off last July after unionist complaints. The dilemma for the two prime ministers, even if they were about to offer an olive branch to the IRA, is that there are growing concerns in the security forces about the threat posed by loyalist paramilitaries. One army source said: 'We are in a process of reassessing the threat. It has traditionally come from one side only but we are having to reorientate our planning to face a possible threat from the other side as well.'   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

0,FT934-16245 ,"FT934-16245 _AN-DJGCLADLFT 931007   FT  07 OCT 93 / Leading Article: Irish manoeuvres      MR John Hume, leader of the SDLP   the non-violent part of the nationalist movement in Northern Ireland - visits Dublin today to give the Irish government a full account of the bilateral talks he has been holding since April with Mr Gerry Adams of Sinn Fein (which represents the violent part), as well as a reaction from Washington where he has been sounding out his friends in the US Congress. The announcement 10 days ago that these talks had reached some kind of conclusion worth reporting to the Irish government has reawakened public interest in that most elusive of political goals, a peaceful settlement of the Northern Irish conflict. The precise content of the report remains private, but its purpose is clear: to devise a political process which would lead to the abandonment by the IRA of their armed struggle, and thereby to bring both strands of nationalism to the negotiating table. Almost simultaneously, it became known the British and Irish governments were jointly drafting a constitutional settlement, to present this to the parties in the province before the end of the year, in which the Irish government would indicate a willingness to modify its constitutional claim to jurisdiction over Northern Ireland to an 'aspiration'. To what extent the two events are linked is unclear, but the sudden publicity given to the second may well have resulted from anxiety in London to minimise the potential fall-out from the first. The British government has enough difficulty fending off the intense suspicion felt by Ulster Unionists about its contacts with Dublin. It knows that that suspicion is liable to become quite unmanageable if it appears at the same time to be negotiating, even indirectly, with the IRA. Intense sensitivities Sir Patrick Mayhew, Britain's Northern Ireland secretary, hurriedly confirmed there would be 'no change whatever' in the province's constitutional status without the consent of its people. But he has neither condemned Mr Hume's talks with Sinn Fein, nor ruled out considering their outcome. If these events signify that a peaceful settlement may indeed be moving, however tentatively, within reach, they also highlight the intense sensitivities on all sides to any perceived deviation from established political traditions in dealing with the Northern Ireland issue. The Irish government, under pressure from Britain to alter articles two and three of the republic's constitution (those which lay claim to sovereignty over the whole island), can only do this by referendum, but fears a rebuff from the electorate if a change on such a delicate issue is not part of 'an overall and balanced settlement'. The premature disclosure of the latest Anglo-Irish talks could increase this risk, by making it sound as though Dublin is covertly plotting a deal in which the republic would be expected to give something for nothing. Ringing endorsements Dublin's anger and embarrassment at the disclosure is to be expected and perhaps explains the ringing endorsements of Mr Hume by no less than four Irish cabinet ministers including the Taoiseach, Mr Albert Reynolds, himself. Mr Reynolds has asked the Unionists 'to suspend judgment' on the Hume-Adams talks until it becomes clear what the substance of their joint proposals is. The Unionists are unlikely to hold their breath for long however, especially if the IRA continues with its bomb outrages, as it has done over the past week. Until there is, at least, an effective ceasefire, the idea of Mr Reynolds and Mr Hume considering peace proposals from Sinn Fein will simply reinforce the Unionist belief that all nationalists are the same under the skin, whatever their public statements about violence. The Irish government, too, has it in its power to improve the atmosphere. It could do so by admitting publicly what many Irish politicians will say in private, namely that far from aspiring, let alone claiming, to govern the north, they regard any such prospect with trepidation. A statement to that effect would both give a clearer lead to public opinion in the republic - most of which would probably be more relieved than angered - and offer much-needed reassurance to the anxious majority in the north.

'There must be a peace dividend in Ireland for peace to succeed,' Mr Clinton said in a White House ceremony to announce the appointment. Although the appointment marks to some degree a larger US role in the search for peace in Northern Ireland, US officials insisted that they were not directly involved in the peace process and were concentrating only on the economic aspects. Mr Clinton's election campaign promise to appoint a peace envoy caused considerable friction with the British government before it was shelved. Mr Mitchell, who did not run for re-election in last month's congressional elections, will step down as leader of the Senate Democratic majority when the new Congress is installed in January. His appointment will take effect on January 10. Although Mr Mitchell's father was the son of Irish immigrants, his more publicised root has generally been his mother's Lebanese origins. A former judge with a keen legal mind, studiously even-tempered manner and unrelenting tenacity, Mr Mitchell has been wooed for a wide range of far more prominent jobs.

Formally, Sinn Fein, the republican political movement, last month appeared to reject the Anglo-Irish overture, and terrorist attacks have continued. But all recent statements by Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, have suggested that he personally is more in favour of peace than war, and has recommended a ceasefire by the IRA. According to a recent editorial in the Irish Times, 'a great body of informed opinion now agrees that the provisional IRA will shortly call another cease-fire in the North'. But the paper concluded gloomily that any ceasefire would be unlikely to last, since the IRA was still hoping for peace on its terms; in other words it was still hoping for total victory. There was little evidence so far that the IRA would settle for peace on the terms offered, which was a peace of compromise and consent, without winners and without losers. The difficulty for the terrorists - and the problem is the same for the IRA as for its extremist counterparts in the Protestant community - is that the Anglo-Irish declaration is deliberately couched in terms designed to shut out a victory by either side. It speaks sympathetically of the principle of self-determination, but makes clear that this principle will be enacted only through a process of democratic consent. If the nationalists and the Catholics in the province want Northern Ireland to become part of a united Ireland, they must persuade the Protestants and the rest of the population in Northern Ireland of their case, and get it accepted through the ballot box. The problem with the declaration is that the terms as stated are either wholly disingenuous or deliberately deceptive. In it, the British government says that it has 'no selfish strategic or economic interest in Northern Ireland', and will uphold 'the democratic wish of a greater number of people of Northern Ireland on the issue of whether they prefer to support the Union or a sovereign united Ireland'. On the face of it, such a position is democratic, statesmanlike, unexceptionable. In fact, it appears to bear little relation to a province which is the product of an Anglo-Irish conflict at least 400 years old, and which has been racked by terrorism from both sides for a quarter of a century. For the moment, the Protestants are in a clear majority, and it is obvious that, if a plebiscite were held now on the future of the province, it would go in favour of continued membership of the United Kingdom. But the Protestants' share of the population is declining relative to the Catholics', and this causes them profound anxiety; if a similar plebiscite were held in a few decades, it might go in favour of a united Ireland. But these two innocent and contrasting scenarios bear no relationship to the reality that Northern Ireland has lived through for the past 25 years. The idea that there can be a simple 'either-or' choice for the future of the province, which could be settled peacefully and definitively by a majority vote, is a fairy tale. The reason for IRA terrorism is that a tiny minority of the minority community does not accept the will of the majority or the legitimacy of the present constitutional position, and is prepared to kill and maim to overthrow it. But a tiny minority of the majority community is also prepared to kill and maim to uphold the present constitutional arrangement. In other words, the one thing missing from Northern Ireland is the principle of democratic consent, which means acceptance of the will of the majority. And since the province is nearly equally divided between two opposing communities, any question which pits them against each other will have the smallest chance of gaining general democratic consent. So if the question which is supposed to be addressed by the Anglo-Irish declaration is the either-or choice between the United Kingdom and a united Ireland, we can be fairly sure that there is no chance of a peaceful decision through the ballot box. Some people maintain that the British government's apparent indifference to the constitutional destiny of Northern Ireland, provided it is settled democratically, could have the perverse effect of provoking terrorism. For if the UK government really does not care whether Northern Ireland stays or goes, maybe the terrorists have more leverage. I am not sure I go this far. But it is nevertheless rather extraordinary that one of the oldest nation states in Europe should profess disinterest in hanging on to one of its provinces. It is, by contrast, inconceivable that any French government should disclaim any 'selfish strategic or economic interest' in Alsace-Lorraine; and just as inconceivable that any Spanish government should shrug off the destiny of Catalonia or the Basque country. On the contrary, they would rule out, as a matter of principle, any amputation of their territory as an outrage to national sovereignty. Some who think the declaration dangerously provocative would argue that the British government ought to rule out, for ever, any change in the formal constitutional attachment of Northern Ireland. Again, I would not go that far. But since it is almost inconceivable that there could be a peaceful constitutional settlement through a simple majority vote, it seems reckless to indulge in loose talk about 'self-determination' and 'consent', when the first is inapplicable and the second is unavailable.

0,FT934-1976 ,"FT934-1976 _AN-DLPC5ACMFT 931216   FT  16 DEC 93 / The Joint Statement on Ulster: 'The most urgent issue is to remove causes of conflict' - Aim to end cycle of violence - British have no strategic or economic interest in province / Self-determination affirmed   Full text of joint declaration 1. The taoiseach, Mr Albert Reynolds TD, and the prime minister, the Rt Hon John Major MP, acknowledge that the most urgent and important issue facing the people of Ireland, north and south, and the British and Irish governments, is to remove the causes of conflict, to overcome the legacy of history and to heal the divisions which have resulted, recognising that the absence of a lasting and satisfactory settlement of relationships between the peoples of both islands has contributed to continuing tragedy and suffering. They believe that the development of an agreed framework for peace, which has been discussed between them since early last year, and which is based on a number of key principles articulated by the two governments over the past 20 years, together with the adaptation of other widely accepted principles, provides the starting point of a peace process designed to culminate in a political settlement. 2. The taoiseach and the prime minister are convinced of the inestimable value, to both their peoples, and particularly for the next generation, of healing divisions in Ireland and of ending a conflict which has been so manifestly to the detriment of all. Both recognise that the ending of divisions can come about only through the agreement and co-operation of the people, north and south, representing both traditions in Ireland. They therefore make a solemn commitment to promote co-operation at all levels on the basis of the fundamental principles, undertakings, obligations under international agreements, to which they have jointly committed themselves, and the guarantees which each government has given and now reaffirms, including Northern Ireland's statutory constitutional guarantee. It is their aim to foster agreement and reconciliation, leading to a new political framework founded on consent and encompassing arrangements within Northern Ireland, for the whole island and between these islands. 3. They also consider that the development of Europe will, of itself, require new approaches to serve interests common to both parts of the island of Ireland, and to Ireland and the UK as partners in the European Union. 4. The prime minister, on behalf of the British government, reaffirms that they will uphold the democratic wish of a greater number of the people of Northern Ireland on the issue of whether they prefer to support the union or a sovereign united Ireland. On this basis, he reiterates, on behalf of the British government, that they have no selfish strategic or economic interest in Northern Ireland. Their primary interest is to see peace, stability and reconciliation established by agreement among all the people who inhabit the island, and they will work together with the Irish government to achieve such an agreement, which will embrace the totality of relationships. The role of the British government will be to encourage, facilitate and enable the achievement of such agreement over a period through a process of dialogue and co-operation based on full respect for the rights and identities of both traditions in Ireland. They accept that such agreement may, as of right, take the form of agreed structures for the island as a whole, including a united Ireland achieved by peaceful means on the following basis. The British government agree that it is for the people of the island of Ireland alone, by agreement between the two parts respectively, to exercise their right of self-determination on the basis of consent, freely and concurrently given, north and south, to bring about a united Ireland, if that is their wish. They reaffirm as a binding obligation that they will, for their part, introduce the necessary legislation to give effect to this, or equally to any measure of agreement on future relationships in Ireland which the people living in Ireland may themselves freely so determine without external impediment. They believe that the people of Britain would wish, in friendship to all sides, to enable the people of Ireland to reach agreement on how they may live together in harmony and in partnership, with respect for their diverse traditions, and with full recognition of the special links and the unique relationship which exists between the peoples of Britain and Ireland. 5. The taoiseach, on behalf of the Irish government, considers that the lessons of Irish history, and especially of Northern Ireland, show that stability and well-being will not be found under any political system which is refused allegiance or rejected on grounds of identity by a significant minority of those governed by it. For this reason, it would be wrong to attempt to impose a united Ireland, in the absence of the freely given consent of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland. He accepts, on behalf of the Irish government, that the democratic right of self-determination by the people of Ireland as a whole must be achieved and exercised with and subject to the agreement and consent of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland and must, consistent with justice and equity, respect the democratic dignity and the civil rights and religious liberties of both communities, including the right to: Free political thought; freedom and expression of religion; pursue democratically national and political aspirations; seek constitutional change by peaceful and legitimate means; live wherever one chooses without hindrance; equal opportunity in all social and economic activity, regardless of class, creed, sex or colour. These would be reflected in any future political and constitutional arrangements emerging from a new and more broadly based agreement. 6. The taoiseach however recognises the genuine difficulties and barriers to building relationships of trust either within or beyond Northern Ireland, from which both traditions suffer. He will work to create a new era of trust, in which suspicion of the motives or actions of others is removed on the part of either community. He considers that the future of the island depends on the nature of the relationship between the two main traditions that inhabit it. Every effort must be made to build a new sense of trust between those communities. In recognition of the fears of the unionist community and as a token of his willingness to make a personal contribution to the building up of that necessary trust, the taoiseach will examine with his colleagues any elements in the democratic life and organisation of the Irish state that can be represented to the Irish government in the course of political dialogue as a real and substantial threat to their way of life and ethos, or that can be represented as not being fully consistent with a modern democratic and pluralist society, and undertakes to examine any possible ways of removing such obstacles. Such an examination would of course have due regard to the desire to preserve those inherited values that are largely shared throughout the island or that belong to the cultural and historical roots of the people of this island in all their diversity. The taoiseach hopes that over time a meeting of hearts and minds will develop, which will bring all the people of Ireland together, and will work towards that objective, but he pledges in the meantime that, as a result of the efforts that will be made to build mutual confidence, no Northern unionist should ever have to fear in future that this ideal will be pursued either by threat or coercion. 7. Both governments accept that Irish unity would be achieved only by those who favour this outcome persuading those who do not, peacefully and without coercion or violence, and that, if in the future a majority of the people of Northern Ireland are so persuaded, both governments will support and give legislative effect to their wish. But, notwithstanding the solemn affirmation by both governments in the Anglo-Irish agreement that any change in the status of Northern Ireland would only come about with the consent of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland, the taoiseach also recognises the continuing uncertainties and misgivings which dominate so much of Northern unionist attitudes towards the rest of Ireland. He believes that we stand at a stage of our history when the genuine feelings of all traditions in the north must be recognised and acknowledged. He appeals to both traditions at this time to grasp the opportunity for a fresh start and a new beginning, which could hold such promise for all our lives and the generations to come. He asks the people of Northern Ireland to look on the people of the republic as friends, who share their grief and shame over all the suffering of the last quarter of a century, and who want to develop the best possible relationship with them, a relationship in which trust and new understanding can flourish and grow. The taoiseach also acknowledges the presence in the constitution of the republic of elements which are deeply resented by Northern unionists, but which at the same time reflect hopes and ideals which lie deep in the hearts of many Irish men and women north and south. But as we move towards a new era of understanding in which new relationships of trust may grow and bring peace to the island of Ireland, the taoiseach believes that the time has come to consider together how best the hopes and identities of all can be expressed in more balanced ways, which no longer engender division and the lack of trust to which he has referred. He confirms that, in the event of an overall settlement, the Irish government will, as part of a balanced constitutional accommodation, put forward and support proposals for change in the Irish constitution which would fully reflect the principle of consent in Northern Ireland. 8. The taoiseach recognises the need to engage in dialogue which would address with honesty and integrity the fears of all traditions. But that dialogue, both within the north and between the people and their representatives of both parts of Ireland, must be entered into with an acknowledgement that the future security and welfare of the people of the island will depend on an open, frank and balanced approach to all the problems which for too long have caused division. 9. The British and Irish governments will seek, along with the Northern Ireland constitutional parties through a process of political dialogue, to create institutions and structures which, while respecting the diversity of the people of Ireland, would enable them to work together in all areas of common interest. This will help over a period to build the trust necessary to end past divisions, leading to an agreed and peaceful future. Such structures would, of course, include institutional recognition of the special links that exist between the peoples of Britain and Ireland as part of the totality of relationships, while taking account of newly forged links with the rest of Europe. 10. The British and Irish governments reiterate that the achievement of peace must involve a permanent end to the use of, or support for, paramilitary violence. They confirm that, in these circumstances, democratically mandated parties which establish a commitment to exclusively peaceful methods and which have shown that they abide by the democratic process, are free to participate fully in democratic politics and to join in dialogue in due course between the governments and the political parties on the way ahead. 11. The Irish government would make their own arrangements within their jurisdiction to enable democratic parties to consult together and share in dialogue about the political future. The taoiseach's intention is that these arrangements could include the establishment, in consultation with other parties, of a Forum for Peace and Reconciliation to make recommendations on ways in which agreement and trust between both traditions in Ireland can be promoted and established. 12. The taoiseach and the prime minister are determined to build on the fervent wish of both their peoples to see old fears and animosities replaced by a climate of peace. They believe the framework they have set out offers the people of Ireland, north and south, whatever their tradition, the basis to agree that from now on their differences can be negotiated and resolved exclusively by peaceful political means. They appeal to all concerned to grasp the opportunity for a new departure. That step would compromise no position or principle, nor prejudice the future for either community. On the contrary, it would be an incomparable gain for all. It would break decisively the cycle of violence and the intolerable suffering it entails for the people of these islands, particularly for both communities in Northern Ireland. It would allow the process of economic and social co-operation on the island to realise its full potential for prosperity and mutual understanding. It would transform the prospect for building on the progress already made in the talks process, involving the two governments and the constitutional parties in Northern Ireland. The taoiseach and the prime minister believe that these arrangements offer an opportunity to lay the foundations for a more peaceful and harmonious future devoid of the violence and bitter divisions which have scarred the past generation. They commit themselves and their governments to continue to work together, unremittingly, towards that objective. December 15 1993.   Countries:-  IEZ  Ireland, EC.     GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

0,FT943-10237 ,"FT943-10237 _AN-EHGAUAA4FT 940806   FT  06 AUG 94 / Hopes improve for IRA ceasefire      By DAVID OWEN   The British and Irish governments have not ruled out the prospect of an imminent IRA ceasefire in spite of Sinn Fein's rejection of the Downing Street declaration and a subsequent upsurge in sectarian killings. Officials think a ceasefire declaration might be made in the period between the 25th anniversary of the deployment of British troops in Ulster on August 14 and the first post-summer meeting of the British cabinet in September. Such a move would increase pressure on the government to admit Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, into talks on the province's future while falling short of London's demands for a permanent cessation of violence. The Irish cabinet is due to hold its first meeting after the holidays on August 31. It is thought that even if the ceasefire was not time-limited, the IRA would reserve the right to retaliation for attacks on its members. Loyalist paramilitaries are said to be in no mood to call a halt to their armed campaign after the recent IRA killings of two men identified as leaders of the Ulster Freedom Fighters, an outlawed Loyalist group. Loyalist violence in the province continued yesterday when police found a body which the outlawed Ulster Volunteer Force said it had dumped on the outskirts of Belfast. The UVF said the man had been shot for passing information to the IRA. Although Whitehall officials remain guarded about the chances of a breakthrough, their assessment of the situation is less gloomy than two weeks ago, when Sinn Fein's dismissal of the joint declaration as inadequate was greeted with anger. Senior Irish officials are understood to have contacted London in the aftermath of the Sinn Fein conference at which its response was decided to advise that the position was not as bleak as portrayed and to urge restraint. Recent days have brought a series of cautious but generally upbeat comments by Sinn Fein leaders, culminating in Mr Gerry Adams's disclosure that he had discussed a ceasefire with the IRA before the Letterkenny meeting. Mr Adams, the Sinn Fein president, said the peace process remained 'firmly on the tracks' and would not be derailed. London has used the period since the Sinn Fein conference to try to press ahead with the search for a deal between Ulster's constitutional parties.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

0,FT943-6368 ,"FT943-6368 _AN-EH3EIABCFT 940830   FT  30 AUG 94 / Hume looks beyond IRA ceasefire      By TIM COONE   Mr John Hume, leader of the mainly Catholic Social Democratic and Labour Party, yesterday called for talks with Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, to start as soon as possible after a genuine end to IRA violence. As speculation continued to mount that the IRA might be about to call a general ceasefire, the air of optimism was reinforced by Cardinal Cahal Daly, leader of the Irish Catholic church, who said Northern Ireland could be on the brink of the best opportunity for peace in 25 years. But the mood was dampened by unionist leaders who voiced fears that Britain might be preparing to make concessions in return for a ceasefire. Mr James Molyneaux, the Ulster Unionist party leader, is likely to raise such concerns with Mr John Major at a meeting expected to be held in a few days. Downing Street said last night, however, that there was no guarantee this meeting would take place this week. Mr Kevin McNamara, shadow Ulster secretary, yesterday warned unionists against trying to block political progress, saying that they should be reassured by guarantees in the Downing Street declaration that there would be no reunification without the consent of the majority in Ulster. Mr Hume, said from his holiday home in Donegal a day after issuing a joint statement with Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president: 'If violence has genuinely stopped, the next step has to be dialogue and I would like to see that begin as soon as possible.' He also responded to scathing unionist criticism of his weekend statement with Mr Adams. He said: 'They don't seem to be listening to what I am saying. We have said that a new agreement is only viable if it enjoys the allegiance of the different traditions on this island. Agreement cannot be achieved without the unionists . . . my objective from day one has been to achieve a total cessation of violence followed by dialogue.' Earlier Mr Molyneaux had accused Mr Hume of 'selling his soul to the devil and joining in a sordid attempt to blackmail the British, American and Irish governments into giving the Armalite supremacy over the ballot box'. The British and Irish governments have repeatedly stressed that a total cessation of violence would be required before Sinn Fein could be admitted to the all-party talks process. The Irish government has offered early participation to Sinn Fein in a 'Forum of Peace and Reconciliation', while the British government has said that a three-month 'quarantine' period would be required before it would enter into negotiations with Sinn Fein. London has refused to make clear whether secret contacts with republican leaders have been resumed, however - although it has pledged that any secret communications would be consistent with publicly stated policies. Mr Hume and Mr Adams said in their joint statement that they believed the 'essential ingredients' of a peaceful approach to a political settlement 'may now be available'. But they said a 'heavy onus' lay on the British government to respond positively. This was echoed by Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, who said the British government had a 'heavy responsibility' to bring about a settlement which included 'an all-round demilitarisation of the situation and the full participation of all parties, on equal terms, in talks leading to a comprehensive political settlement'. Cardinal Daly said it had long been the goal of many to take the gun out of Irish politics. 'The attainment of that goal may now be very near.'   Countries:-  IEZ  Ireland, EC.

0,FT934-11416 ,"FT934-11416 _AN-DKACHABWFT 931101   FT  01 NOV 93 / Leaders ready to pay political price of peace / A look at at the realities prime ministers Major and Reynolds are prepared to accept      By PHILIP STEPHENS   THE MEETING on Friday between Mr John Major and Mr Albert Reynolds showed that the London and Dublin governments are more determined than for many years to achieve a political settlement for Northern Ireland. The most recent in the latest spate of terrorist outrages just 24 hours later underlines the depths of the morass from which they are seeking to lift the province. Both sides are aware that as long as the political vacuum remains then the spiral of violence will continue, and quite possibly escalate. But after more than 20 bloody years neither can be confident that the political initiative on which they have embarked can avoid the roadblocks which have halted so many of its precursors. The lengthy communique released after the talks in Brussels renounced terrorism, declared that there could be no place at the negotiating table for those who used violence to further political aims, and underlined the central role of the Ulster constitutional parties in any settlement. This might seem to represent no more than a statement of the obvious, but the very fact of its release sent an important message: that Mr Major and Mr Reynolds were ready to expend political capital in a resumed effort at permanent peace, and that in the process both were prepared to own up to some obvious realities. From Dublin the message was that it was now ready to remove what Mr Major saw as two of the most foremost obstacles to peace. As part of an overall settlement, Mr Reynolds would be ready to ask the voters of the republic to remove from the Irish constitution its claim to jurisdiction over the north, and the republic would recognise explicitly the veto over change in the province exercised by supporters of the union. For its part London would now state publicly what had always been obvious but never admitted so explicitly by a British government: that if the IRA ceased its military campaign a place would be found at the negotiating table for Sinn Fein. Behind the scenes Mr Major has also acknowledged that the quid pro quo for changes in the republic's constitution would be a significant increase in administrative co-operation between north and south. Over the next few weeks the two governments will seek to build on that agreement, starting at the meeting on Wednesday between Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, and Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary. Mr Major and Mr Reynolds will seek to strengthen it further at a UK-Irish summit in Dublin within six weeks. The aim is to create an atmosphere which will persuade the constitutional parties - above all the unionists - to return to the negotiating table to thrash out an internal political settlement. Reassurance for the unionists ran right through the Major-Reynolds statement: in the promise that there would be no secret deals; in the joint disavowal of the initiative launched by Mr John Hume, the SDLP leader, with Mr Gerry Adams of Sinn Fein; and in Dublin's implicit acknowledgement of the unionist 'veto'. In practice, the two governments are reversing the order of negotiations in the three-strand peace process which stalled at the end of last year. Then the priority was an agreement between the Northern Ireland parties before moving on to the second and third strands - relations between north and south in Ireland and an agreement between the republic and Britain on Ulster's constitutional status. Now the aim is to secure a broad measure of agreement on strands one and two as an umbrella for negotiations on strand one. But if the logic of a London-Dublin accord providing a catalyst for the restart of talks between the parties in the province is obvious enough, its chances of success are precarious. The unionists, whose self-importance is bolstered by Mr Major's reliance on their votes at Westminster, must be persuaded that the talks offer something better than the status quo. Mr James Molyneaux, leader of the Ulster Unionist party, is now the most important player in the game. Without a positive response from him, the latest initiative will go nowhere. Mr Hume, badly bruised by the rejection of his initiative, must also be brought back within the inter-governmental process. He remains as convinced as ever that a cessation of violence by the IRA is within reach if Mr Major is prepared to listen carefully to the ideas to which Sinn Fein has put its name. He has staked too much on his talks with Mr Adams to withdraw quietly now. Yet British officials were suggesting yesterday that the picture beneath the surface was not as bleak as the familiarly unpromising rhetoric of Ulster politicians may suggest. Mr Molyneaux has remained silent. If he offered to return to the negotiating table, both Mr Hume and the Rev Ian Paisley, the leader of the hardline Democratic Unionist party, would find it hard not to join him. The good intentions might this time offer at least a start on the road to an agreement.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.     IEZ  Ireland, EC.   Industries:-  P9721 International Affairs.

0,FT934-7948 ,"FT934-7948 _AN-DKRC7AAWFT 931118   FT  18 NOV 93 / Talks on Irish wage pact falter      By TIM COONE      DUBLIN   IRELAND faces the prospect of a wages free-for-all following the breakdown of talks yesterday between the government and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU) over a new centralised pay bargaining agreement. ICTU yesterday notified its affiliated unions to prepare for a return to free collective bargaining, having failed in its attempts to persuade the government to remove an unpopular 1 per cent income levy over the next two budgets. For the past six years, public and private sector pay rises have been regulated through tripartite agreements between the government, employers' organisations and ICTU, the latter representing the bulk of organised labour in the country. The first agreement, known as the Programme for National Recovery, ran from 1987-1990 and the second, known as the Programme for Economic and Social Progress (PESP), ran from 1991 and expires at the end of this year. The two agreements have been largely responsible for the economic stability in Ireland over the past six years, peace on the industrial relations front, and the achievement of one of the best economic growth rates and one of the lowest inflation rates throughout the European Union. Mr Bertie Ahern, the finance minister, introduced the 1 per cent income levy in last January's budget to help meet pay deals in the public sector and raise funds for a job creation programme. Its critics have argued that the levy amounts to a 2 per cent increase in the basic income tax rate, in that it is calculated as a 1 per cent of the whole income, without any allowances. Mr Peter Cassells, the general secretary of ICTU said the levy 'struck at the heart of the PESP, acting as a clawback of pay deals that had already been settled and so our members have lost confidence in the process'. The levy is worth some IPounds 145m (Pounds 138m) per year to the Exchequer, and Mr Ahern has said that even if the levy were to be removed, in time, it would have to be balanced by tax increases elsewhere. Mr Ahern said earlier this week that 'the government is anxious to enter into a new agreement, but not at any price'. Public sector pay has risen by 46 per cent since 1987, while inflation has risen by only around 15 per cent.   Countries:-  IEZ  Ireland, EC.

In an interview in Boston yesterday with THE IRISH TIMES, Mr  Reynolds said it was futile to talk in isolation about removing  the constitutional claim to the North and that there had to be a  balanced constitutional agreement. Spelling out for the first  time what this means, Mr Reynolds said: ""Institutional links  between North and South will have executive powers. That's the  type of overall framework we're looking to.""    He said there was still a ""fair bit of work to be done"" in  the talks between officials from Dublin and London, but he was  hopeful he and British Prime Minister, Mr John Major, could  achieve their aim of agreement by mid-July.    Mr Reynolds was in Boston to receive the Christian A. Herter  Memorial Award from the World Affairs Council of Boston for his  role in the peace process.    President Clinton sent a message of congratulations to Mr  Reynolds who, he said, had earned the respect and admiration of  world leaders for his contribution to peace.    In his acceptance speech, Mr Reynolds laid stress on the  need  for a balanced constitutional accommodation. New arrangements,  he said, ""must provide a clear and explicit institutional  framework for the development of the necessary North-South  co-operation and co- ordination in areas of mutual benefit.""    Expanding on this in his interview, Mr Reynolds said there  had to be an even-handed approach in the negotiations with  Britain and therefore the Government of Ireland Act 1920 and  Articles 2 and 3 should be on the table ""for negotiation both  ways.""    ""That's the Act that set up partition in the first place,  but  it also had the intentions of the British Government at the time  to move on towards eventual unity of Ireland, and that (in the  meantime) intermediate steps would be taken,"" he said.    Asked if he was seeking a quid pro quo involving some type  of  cross-border authority with executive powers in return for the  dropping of Articles 2 and 3, Mr Reynolds said: ""Those are the  type of areas we are exploring between the two governments at  the moment. What I'm saying is institutional links between North  and South will have executive powers. That's the type of  overall framework we're looking to, but that emanates clearly  from the contents of the Downing Street Declaration.""    Mr Reynolds acknowledged that unionists might view this as a  form of the Council of Ireland which they had strongly rejected  in the past.    In the declaration, ""we make it clear that there has to be a  wider settlement involving other relationships, internal  relationships in Northern Ireland, North-South co-operation and  an institutional framework to reflect the diversity of the two  parts and between the islands of Ireland and Great Britain.""    On the role of the United States, Mr Reynolds said the  message from the United States to the nationalists was: ""We're  here to support you but we're not here to support any  continuation of violence. Give up the violence and you can rely  on us for our support to see that the cause is not ignored and  that whatever commitments are given will be implemented.""    Mr Reynolds continued: ""That's a very important guarantor  situation for the United States and the people in the United  States to have taken up."" He said he now expected a response  from Sinn Fein to the Downing Street Declaration by ""the early  days of July, if not before.""     "

0,FT941-8490 ,"FT941-8490 _AN-EBTAMABPFT 940219   FT  19 FEB 94 / Dublin demands stronger plan for co-operation      By MICHAEL CASSELL, DAVID OWEN and TIM COONE   Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, will today tell Mr John Major that the British government must strengthen its proposals for greater cross-border co-operation in order to achieve a political settlement in Northern Ireland. Mr Reynolds will indicate to his British counterpart, during a planned one-hour meeting in Downing Street, that Dublin is likely to make clear its own ideas on the north-south relationship within about a month. This month Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, gave Dublin a check-list of outline proposals for renewed talks aimed at a settlement and asked for the republic's response. Today's meeting comes a week before Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, holds its annual conference near Dublin. With signs that the Irish government remains more optimistic than London of a positive response to the peace proposals, Mr Reynolds is expected to urge Mr Major to be cautious in his efforts to step up pressure on Sinn Fein to renounce violence and take a place at the negotiating table. Downing Street was yesterday playing down the significance of the meeting, saying that no formal statement was expected. One official said it could be seen as 'a visible demonstration of the desire of both governments to be relentless in putting pressure on Sinn Fein and the IRA to declare their hands'. Mr Reynolds is keen to give the meeting more prominence however, and has interviews planned later with the media at the Irish embassy in London after the England and Ireland rugby match. There appears to be a conviction in Dublin that, while a breakthrough may not be imminent, there are nevertheless indications that an IRA ceasefire may be forthcoming soon. Significantly, it is the belief at the highest levels in the Irish government that Sinn Fein and the seven-man army council of the IRA are willing to accept the joint declaration. Last week Mr Reynolds responded by letter to Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, for his request for 'clarifications' of the joint declaration. There have since been further communications via intermediaries, and according to officials in the republican movement Sinn Fein views the Irish government's stance positively. The problem appears to be that lower echelons in the IRA are not willing to go along with the declaration and a permanent ceasefire without further assurances from the British government.

0,FT944-9654 ,"FT944-9654 _AN-EKOENABXFT 941115   FT  15 NOV 94 / Peace in Ireland finds itself at mercy of peace in Dail: The government imbroglio and possible effects on progress of the framework document      By JOHN MURRAY BROWN   Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, was questioned yesterday by reporters about the prospect of a collapse of the Irish government as he arrived in Dublin for talks with Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister. 'Mayhew stays out of coalition crisis,' Mr Mayhew said, quoting an Irish newspaper headline. 'I wish we all had the same options,' Mr Spring replied. Mr Albert Reynolds, the prime minister, today addresses the Dail, the Irish parliament, where his Fianna Fail party is under attack from Mr Spring over the appointment of Mr Harry Whelehan, the Irish attorney-general, as president of the High Court. Mr Whelehan's mishandling of a child abuse case had already put pressure on the governing coalition of Fianna Fail and Mr Spring's Labour party. Mr Reynolds' decision last week to appoint Mr Whelehan as president of the High Court pushed the coalition to the brink of collapse. The common view yesterday was that whatever Mr Reynolds may say in the Dail, a deepening crisis can be averted only by the resignation of Mr Whelehan, which few observers think likely. If he stays, Ireland seems likely to have a new government - either through an election or a new alliance of parties in the Dail. For Northern protestants, there will be a certain irony if the Dublin government is to fall on this particular question - it concerns a warrant to have a Roman Catholic priest extradited by the Royal Ulster Constabulary from the republic. Few officials doubt that a period of political uncertainty will disrupt the peace process. All Ireland's political parties are committed to the search for peace but Fianna Fail, more than other parties, is rooted in the republican tradition - although it is said of Mr Reynolds that he carries the ideological baggage more lightly than earlier party leaders. Mr Reynolds has been pivotal in the peace effort - in particular his understanding with Mr John Hume, leader of Northern Ireland's moderate nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party, has provided a bridge to Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein leader. Under his leadership, the Irish government has been concerned to sustain the momentum of the peace process - sometimes provoking criticism that it was moving too quickly. There is as yet no pressure on Mr Reynolds's leadership within his party. Irish civil servants no doubt find it galling to be lectured about parliamentary democracy by the likes of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, which has voiced concern about possible disruption of the peace process by the coalition crisis. But if the callers to one Irish radio programme are any measure, many ordinary people are perplexed that the coalition should break down at this critical stage of the peace process - which comes at a time when progress is also being made on the economy and the legislative agenda. In seeking an explanation for the crisis, observers point to the personality of Mr Reynolds - an abrasive, instinctive politician, unusual in Ireland in being a successful self-made businessman, a petfood magnate and showband impresario. And as Ms Mary Harney, head of the Progressive Democrats, pointed out, Mr Reynolds has been here before. His attacks on Mr Des O'Malley, former PD leader, led to the break up of the Fianna Fail-PD government and triggered the general election in November 1992. Mr Martin McGuinness, Sinn Fein vice-president, said over the weekend that a change of government would be 'very, very unhelpful' and voiced misgivings about working with some of the other political parties which he accused of being 'less than helpful' in support of the peace effort. In particular, Sinn Fein has made clear its misgivings about working with Mr John Bruton, who since 1990 has been leader of Fine Gael, the main opposition party. A farmer, economist and barrister, Mr Bruton's spell as finance minister was marked by the pursuit of market-oriented economic policies. Mr Reynolds mistakenly referred to Mr Bruton as 'John Unionist' in an interview during the last election campaign. Fine Gael is a conservative party with largely middle-class support. Since the Fianna Fail-Labour coalition government was formed in January last year, it has had some internal difficulties, culminating in a leadership challenge to Mr Bruton in February. Sinn Fein must feel almost as uncomfortable about the prospect that one party which might have a role in forming a new government is the Democratic Left, a breakaway from the Workers party which itself was formed when the Official IRA broke ranks with the Provisionals in the 1970s. On current calculations, Labour could join forces with centre-right Fine Gael and the Democratic Left - with a total of 85 seats, such a coalition would have a narrow majority in the 166-seat house. If that fails to materialise, Fianna Fail could look for new partners, though after its unhappy alliances with PD and now Labour, the most likely candidates would be the Democratic Left or independents.

Mr Hume, in an address to the party conference in Blackpool, will rally support for Mr Kevin McNamara, shadow Northern Ireland secretary, in the face of growing criticism of his pro-nationalist approach. SDLP officials said that Mr Hume, a long-standing political ally of Mr McNamara, would pay tribute to the 'responsible role' in the peace process played by Labour's front bench. The depth of concern about the party's existing policy was demonstrated yesterday by the powerful conference arrangements' committee, which decided to allow a number of emergency motions on Northern Ireland to be debated. One of the motions, drawn up by the Independent Labour Publications pressure group, calls for a full review of Irish policy in the light of the Downing Street declaration and the IRA's open-ended ceasefire. Such a review would raise the prospect of a more neutral Labour approach to Northern Ireland, in line with comments by Mr Tony Blair since his election as party leader. Some leading members of the moderate Ulster Unionist party have suggested that the party's nine MPs might be willing to work with Labour after the next election if Mr McNamara and the unity-by-consent formula were dumped. Concern about Labour's nationalist approach is also spreading among MPs not normally regarded as close participants in party debates on the issue. Mr Mike Gapes, a member of the Commons foreign affairs committee, calls in Co-operative News for a rethink on Northern Ireland, warning against 'glib official slogans' such as unity by consent. He says 'Toytown trotskyist talk of colonialism' and phrases such as 'self-determination for the Irish people as a whole' can only worsen the province's problems. The party's unity-by-consent policy has been under severe strain since the IRA ceasefire. Mr Blair has given unequivocal support to the Downing Street declaration and to the government's promise of a referendum in Northern Ireland on constitutional changes. However, Labour's formal conference agenda, drawn up before the IRA ceasefire, contains only hardline nationalist resolutions.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

It said clearly that a continuation of the IRA military campaign was an obstacle to progress in the peace process. The refusal by Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, to rush into a response to December's Downing Street declaration may smack of pedantry, procrastination and downright deviousness. But if the message that was repeatedly stated at the latest hearing of its 'Peace Commission' has found its target, then the wait will have been worth it. The Sinn Fein Peace Commission consists of a series of public hearings in Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic, in which written and oral submissions on the peace process and the Downing Street declaration are being invited from the public. The first was held in Londonderry two weeks ago. The second was held this weekend in a Dublin hotel and two more are scheduled to be held in the republic before Sinn Fein's annual congress at the end of this month. Somewhat surprisingly, the submissions made in Dublin were neither acrimonious diatribes from opponents, nor eulogies of regurgitated republicanism from sympathisers. For the most part they were carefully argued presentations, coming from people as diverse as Jesuit priests, trade unionists, community associations, civil rights activists, peace groups hostile to Sinn Fein, writers and even musicians. One of the most cogent presentations came from Mr Michael Farrell, a solicitor and civil-rights activist who is widely respected in republican and nationalist circles. He started by arguing that the joint declaration and the British government had failed to address nationalist fears adequately. But he went on to say that Sinn Fein had been 'unconvincing' in trying to draw a distinction between the joint declaration's guarantee to respect the majority wishes in Northern Ireland - described by Sinn Fein as the unionist 'veto' - and the Hume-Adams statements which the IRA supports, which speak of the need for unionist consent to any new political settlement. Moreover, continuation of the IRA campaign while clarification of the Downing Street declaration was being sought 'is irresponsible and inconsistent with (the IRA's) own support for the Hume-Adams proposals' he said. 'Whatever the situation in the past, the means are now in place to allow republicans to secure their objectives by political action. I do not believe the IRA's armed struggle could achieve anything more. Indeed I think it is counter-productive,' he said. Most of the 25 submissions carried a similar message. The British government should be pressed to offer guarantees to protect the civil rights and Irish identity of the nationalist minority in Northern Ireland, to balance the 'fulsome guarantees offered to the unionists'. But in spite of this weakness from a nationalist point of view, the Downing Street declaration had opened up new opportunities. Most importantly, a ceasefire should be declared. Mr Michael Nugent of the New Consensus movement, a long-time opponent of the IRA and Sinn Fein, called for the party to 'test the bona fides' of the joint declaration and for the IRA to declare 'a temporary and indefinite ceasefire'. This, he said, 'would open up an entirely new situation'. The Sinn Fein convener of the commission said: 'We are taking the submissions very seriously indeed.'

The UK accepted an increase in cross-border co-operation and the possibility of Sinn Fein entering talks if the IRA laid down its arms. The six-point plan set out last week by Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, paved the way for the initiative. The six points were: People in Ireland, north and south, without coercion and without violence, should be free to determine their own future. New structures should be developed for governing the province, for north-south relationships and for UK-Irish relations. No agreement can be reached on any change in the status of Northern Ireland without the freely expressed consent of the majority of the people of Northern Ireland. Unionist consent will be required for any constitutional change in the north. The Irish constitution will be amended 'at the right time and in the right circumstances' to reflect any agreed changes. There will be a place at the negotiating table for the 'men of violence' if they cease their violence. The SDLP and Sinn Fein are concerned by Mr Spring's apparent acceptance of a unionist veto - as opposed to a majority veto - over constitutional change in Northern Ireland. On Irish radio yesterday, Mr Reynolds referred only to majority consent. The statement from the UK and the republic was unequivocal that there could be 'no question of adopting or endorsing' the Hume-Adams initiative, which envisages a simultaneous referendum north and south of the border on any future changes to Northern Ireland's status, but recognises the principle of majority consent in the north.

Yesterday's meeting was the first between the two governments since November, when it was agreed to suspend further efforts to renew the political talks process in Northern Ireland until after the general elections in the Republic. Mr Spring and Sir Patrick said their first meeting had been 'very worthwhile and satisfactory' and that they had covered all the main areas necessary 'to get the talks process working well and to bring it to a successful conclusion'. It is expected that at least two Anglo-Irish conference meetings will be necessary to prepare the way for a renewed series of talks involving the Northern Ireland political parties. The previous 'three-strand' talks ended inconclusively last year, with the two Unionist parties accusing Dublin of having been too inflexible over the Republic's territorial claim to the province. Sir Patrick said yesterday: 'Informal consultations should be the first stage and then we'll see where that takes us.'   Countries:-  IEZ  Ireland, EC.     GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Now it is time to revert to more orthodox methods. With hopes of an early IRA response to the Downing Street declaration fading fast, London has been trying to inject momentum into the three-year-old talks process with Ulster's non-violent political parties. It badly needs a success to prevent the impetus behind the drive for a lasting settlement for the province from draining away. There are also hopes that progress in the political talks might yet be the lever that eventually persuades republican leaders to ditch the armed struggle and embrace the process. As Dr John Alderdice, leader of the non-sectarian Alliance party, puts it: 'As Sinn Fein sees the train drawing out of the station, they may be prepared to jump on board.' Yet a series of Financial Times interviews in recent days with the leaders of the four main constitutional parties indicates that many serious obstacles still stand in the way of a positive outcome. The leaders' comments, in brief, point to a long and tortuous process with success far from assured. The words with which the Rev Ian Paisley greeted the announcement by the then Northern Ireland secretary Mr Peter Brooke in March 1991 that a basis for formal political talks existed still seem apposite. 'The gate into the field has been opened,' the leader of the hardline Democratic Unionist party said at the time. 'But . . . there is a lot of hard ploughing in front of us.' The main problem areas appear to be as follows: The 'nothing is agreed until everything is agreed' formula. This, by definition, precludes the possibility of gradual progress. Every syllable and punctuation mark has to be agreed before anything can be set in stone. Mr John Hume, leader of the mainly Roman Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party, regards the principle as 'crucially important'. It ensures the talks address all the relationships - within Northern Ireland, between north and south, and between the two governments, he says. An agreement confined to the question of 'who wields power in Northern Ireland' would not necessarily solve the province's problems, Mr Hume believes. Unionists favour a less ambitious framework paving the way for a return to devolved government in Ulster, independent of what might be agreed in the other two 'strands' of the talks process. They point out that a blueprint for an Ulster assembly was drawn up by a working party comprising all four constitutional parties during the talks initiated by Mr Brooke. Mr Paisley says openly that, as far as he is concerned, the formula no longer applies. It was exposed as a 'fallacy' during the 'failed' Brooke talks process, he says. How to handle the relationship between the north and Dublin. There is no disguising the fundamental differences between the participants on this second strand of the talks process. An Ulster Unionist party document to be published this month will argue that the relationship should be handled by ad hoc meetings between Irish ministers and Ulster assembly representatives. But proposals implying that no separate north-south institution - such as a dedicated secretariat - is necessary would probably be anathema to the SDLP and to Dublin. Mr James Molyneaux, the UUP leader, goes so far as to say: 'Not only are the institutionalised bits unnecessary, but they are unconstitutional. 'They would tend to tie elected representatives from one part of the United Kingdom into bargains/arrangements/undertakings without our sovereign government being aware of it,' he says. The DUP's boycott of the talks. Not only is Sinn Fein excluded from the talks process. So at present is the DUP. While this could make agreement between those who are participating less difficult to achieve, it might also undermine its effectiveness. As Mr Michael Ancram, the Northern Ireland minister, said yesterday: 'A political settlement that brings peace is one that has to have widespread acceptance.' The current DUP line is that it will not return to the talks until London explicitly rules out any possibility of a united Ireland. According to one senior DUP official, London would have to 'embark on a new security policy that demonstrates the British are here to stay, irrespective of consent'. The reluctance of some participants to move from bilateral discussions back to a round-table format. After the experience of the Brooke talks, some are wary of returning to what they see as the 'goldfish-bowl' of round-table discussions. There is though a general recognition that the current time-consuming bilateral structure cannot continue indefinitely. Mr Molyneaux favours 'a fair amount of commonality' being established before participants go back to sitting around a table. The two governments' apparent inability to prevent a continuation of terrorism. It is in Mr Hume's words 'quite obvious' that the talks process's prospects of success would be improved immeasurably if they took place 'in an atmosphere of total peace'. That is why the SDLP leader says he has pleaded for patience in awaiting Sinn Fein's response to the joint declaration. Continuing terrorist killings can only exacerbate tensions. But can a cessation of violence be delivered even in the event of an end to the IRA's 25-year campaign? Mr Paisley, for one, is pessimistic.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Mr John Major, the prime minister, sought to increase pressure on republicans by describing their calls for clarification as 'an increasingly desperate attempt to avoid facing up to the clear choice that confronts them'. Mr Major's comments overshadowed concern on both sides of the Irish border about calls by Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, for 'demilitarisation' in Northern Ireland. Officials in London and Dublin played down Mr Reynolds' remarks, which drew an angry response from unionists and a cautious welcome from Sinn Fein. Downing Street said there was no disagreement with the Irish government. Writing in this morning's edition of the unionist Belfast Newsletter, Mr Major pledged to pursue 'with renewed vigour' the so-called three-stranded talks which began in 1992. Mr Major said that agreement in the talks, which involve constitutional parties in London, Dublin and Belfast, was a 'priority' for 1994. Sinn Fe'in is excluded from the three-stranded process, but Mr Major confirmed that the party would be allowed to take part three months after a cessation of IRA violence. In a passage aimed at the Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the hard-line Democratic Unionist party, Mr Major said suggestions that the joint declaration was a sell-out were 'nonsense'. Unionists reacted angrily to the Irish prime minister's assertion that 'the time has come to start the process of demilitarisation of the Northern conflict'. Mr Reynolds also said both governments should be 'persuaders for a new agreement on the future of the whole island'. Mr Reynolds' remarks were welcomed by Mr Martin McGuinness, a leading member of Sinn Fein, which in the past has used similar language. But hard-line unionists insist that the British government should defend the status quo rather than seek to persuade them of the need for change. Mr Paisley said Mr Reynolds' words made clear that the joint declaration was 'marked with the bloody thumbprints of the IRA'. The Rev Martin Smyth, a senior spokesman for the moderate Ulster Unionist party, said Mr Reynolds' choice of words was 'highly insensitive'. However, he indicated that the UUP was comfortable with the prospect of British troop withdrawals relatively soon after a permanent halt to IRA violence.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Sir Patrick, who spoke with state department officials in Washington and was expected to see Mr Tom Foley, the speaker of the House of Representatives, and Senator Edward Kennedy, is also understood to have reiterated UK opposition to the sending of a US 'peace envoy' mooted by President Clinton. The British government has, however, made it clear that it would accept a delegation with a less specific role. The government is also concerned about the adoption of the so-called 'MacBride principles' for company investment policies by US state and city governments. The principles are meant to promote employment of Roman Catholics but the government argues that existing 'fair employment' laws are sufficiently tough. Speaking earlier in New York, Sir Patrick said that Noraid, the US fundraising group that wants a united Ireland, was a declining force unable to collect money for the IRA. Although the IRA claimed to be freedom fighters, Sir Patrick said that all they were fighting for was 'freedom from the common obligations of humanity'. One of President Clinton's top advisers Mr Ray Flynn, the US ambassador-designate to the Vatican, said yesterday that Mr Clinton was as committed now to helping break the political logjam as he was during the presidential campaign. In Londonderry Mr Flynn, the Mayor of Boston, said: 'I do feel the president is very committed to playing a constructive, positive and meaningful role in helping to end the violence in Northern Ireland.' Mr Flynn, who is on a three-day fact-finding visit to Ireland, said he supported the talks between Mr John Hume, the SDLP leader, and Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein leader, and believed Sinn Fein should be involved in any talks process.

Mr Nigel Smyth, director of the CBI in the province, said: 'We have to welcome any statement that reflects people's will to stop violence, and hope it is permanent.' Mr Denis Galway, senior vice-president of the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said the ceasefire would contribute to business confidence, tourist development and international investment. Mr Frank Caddy, chief executive of the Belfast Chamber of Trade, said city traders were looking forward to attracting more leading high street names. The atmosphere in Belfast city centre had changed since the IRA called its ceasefire and he expected it to get even better. 'The pace has slowed down, people are stopping and looking, not rushing in to buy and get out,' he said. Mr John Hume, leader of the SDLP, welcomed the announcement as 'a very good day for the people of Northern Ireland, a day which they deserve. Let us now put the past behind us and work together to build a future we can all be proud of.' Mr Jim Wilson, general secretary of the Ulster Unionist party, welcomed the move and said it was clear that the loyalist paramilitaries had been listening to his party leader Mr James Molyneaux when he said that there had been no sell-out to republicans and no shift in the government attitude to the future constitutional position of the province. Mr David Trimble, Ulster Unionist MP, said there would have to be an election before the fringe loyalist political parties and Sinn Fein could be invited to political talks. He said: 'We are dealing here with very small political parties and we are dealing with the question of whether they do in fact have an electoral mandate. In another way Sinn Fein have the same problem.' The Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionist party, welcomed 'the fact that people are not going to continue murdering'. But he totally rejected any suggestion of talks involving former paramilitaries on either side. 'There's nobody can get to the negotiating table because they've used a gun and murdered people,' he said.

He also hinted that the government could be close to proposing the establishment of a Northern Ireland select committee. Such a move would be seen as reinforcing the government's commitment to the province's Unionist majority. In his second Commons appearance this week Sir Patrick was asked by Mr Kevin McNamara, shadow Northern Ireland secretary: 'Do you acknowledge the value of the goal of a united Ireland?' The question was similar to one in a leaked draft Dublin position paper which is privately acknowledged to be among the principal sticking-points over an agreed framework for a settlement. Sir Patrick's reply - that the government could not 'join the ranks of the persuaders' - underlined London's unwillingness to back down on the issue. He said: 'We believe that it should be for the people of Northern Ireland to determine for themselves without persuasion from us whether they wish to remain in the UK or no.' Sir Patrick offered encouragement to supporters of a Northern Ireland select committee. In a carefully worded answer to Mr John Hume, Social Democratic and Labour party leader, Sir Patrick said: 'It might be said that there is some value in having a select committee looking at the affairs of Northern Ireland, rather than having six separate select committees taking part of Northern Ireland's affairs into their ambit. 'There has been much said here about the need to reduce the democratic deficit in Northern Ireland.' But Sir Patrick disagreed with an assertion by Mr James Molyneaux, the Ulster Unionist party leader, that restoring accountable democracy to Northern Ireland was 'a necessary first step' to restoring stability 'and subsequently peace'. He acknowledged that there was 'a good measure of agreement' on the need for new political institutions in the province. Mr Major later spoke of an 'overwhelming feeling' that the government should strive for peace in Northern Ireland, but added: 'There are parameters to those discussions - and that must be understood.'

'The so-called 'permanent ceasefire' by the IRA and Loyalist paramilitaries has held, and British troop levels in the province have been reduced to only 10 per cent of what they were in 1993. 'Negotiators from the unionist and nationalist camps, together with representatives of the British and Irish governments, under EC chairmanship, are now entering their final phase of negotiations for a permanent settlement of a dispute that has divided the people of the island since 1921. 'The settlement plan is expected to be put to a simultaneous referendum in both parts of Ireland within six months of the signing of the agreement by all parties'. OF course such a scenario is futuristic fiction. But it is not fantasy. For this vision of a future settlement is central to the only publicly-acknowledged political dialogue taking place in Northern Ireland since the round-table talks between the main political parties in the province broke down with no agreement last November. That dialogue is between Mr John Hume, the leader of the Social Democratic Labour Party (SDLP), and Mr Gerry Adams, the leader of Sinn Fein - the political wing of the IRA. Attacked by the Unionists for what they say is an effort to form a 'pan-nationalist front', Mr Hume says the dialogue is 'about agreeing an overall strategy for a lasting peace - and an overall strategy includes everybody. 'It is not a joint strategy as some people have tried to make out . . . what I want is a complete and utter cessation of violence on all sides . . . Gerry Adams is very serious, and the people he represents are very serious about these talks and their objectives'. So Mr Hume says: 'I have never felt more hopeful in 20 years than I do now.' There are other grounds for believing that some change might be in the wind. While the IRA's bombing campaign and the Loyalists' killings of Catholics show no sign of letting up, the language of Sinn Fein has taken on a decidedly more moderate and conciliatory tone over the past year. Sinn Fein spokespersons now talk of 'inclusive dialogue' and 'recognition of the Unionist identity'. They even say that a united Ireland - their preferred option - might not necessarily be the end result of a negotiating process. Presbyterian ministers have been holding secret talks with paramilitary leaders on both sides over the past year, while the outlawed Loyalist Ulster Defence Association (UDA) recently announced that it is prepared to meet and talk to Archbishop Cathal Daly, the Catholic primate. The Opsahl Commission, an independent body set up in 1992 to sound out a broad range of public opinion from across the province, concluded earlier this year that there is a strong desire for political compromise to end the violence - a message from the constituencies which, apparently, many of the province's politicians have still not heard. Intriguing reports have also appeared, over the summer, of secret negotiations between the army and the IRA on a 60-point military de-escalation plan. These have been strenuously denied by both the Northern Ireland Office and Sinn Fein, but they add to a more general impression that although the mainstream political process has ended up in limbo, nonetheless intensive efforts are being made behind the scenes to broker a peace. The key to whether Mr Hume can now succeed in his more public efforts to achieve a cessation of hostilities, as a means of getting everybody around the negotiating table, will be whether the British government's stated position that it has no strategic interest in Northern Ireland, that it is neutral in the conflict, and has no preferred option for a settlement, will stand up under the strains of Westminster politics. Just before the summer recess at Westminster, the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) led by Mr James Molyneaux, voted with Mr John Major and his Conservative party on a finely-balanced Maastricht vote. Mr Molyneaux announced that the UUP would be giving its support to the Conservatives for the remaining life of the present parliament, but simultaneously denied that any deal had been struck with the Tories. But there now exist high expectations among Unionist politicians in the province that long sought after changes in the administration of Northern Ireland will take place over the next two years. These include the establishment of a parliamentary select committee on Northern Ireland, and for more powers to be handed over to local councils from the Northern Ireland Office (NIO). One UUP councillor in Londonderry says: 'We have discussed and been lobbying for this at Westminster for some time.' If such changes were to be implemented unilaterally, the Irish government has already indicated that it would consider this tantamount to a violation of the 1985 Anglo-Irish Treaty. Mr Hume says: 'Any secret agreement between the British government and one party in Northern Ireland would have no chance of succeeding, particularly if it is related to restoring power to local authorities before it has been clearly established that any such power would be exercised fairly . . . To play party politics of that nature with Northern Ireland in order to stay in power is utterly irresponsible. Everybody will end up paying a price for it including the government that enters into such an agreement.' Abandonment of the talks process, and the adoption of a more unilateralist approach by the UK government, would deal a severe blow to Anglo-Irish relations. Ministers from the two governments meet this week in London to review whether there is any life remaining in the talks process, and indeed whether they can still claim to share a bipartisan approach. The Republic has indicated it might now take a different tack and seek the appointment of a US special envoy to the province. It is thought that such an envoy would not be as constrained about talking to Sinn Fein as would the Irish and British governments. So while fresh approaches may be imminent on the political front, there is also optimism emerging on the economic one. The clouds of recession have already broken up over Northern Ireland and business confidence is now the strongest in years. Unemployment is beginning to fall and retail sales are growing. All these act as spurs to new investment such as that in Londonderry, where Pounds 65m is being spent on a new shopping and office complex in the city which will serve an economic hinterland on both sides of the border. Several important new foreign and local investments have been announced in the past year, and continuing infrastructural improvements in the roads, ports and airports are making the province an increasingly attractive location for both business and tourism. Last year a record number of 1.25m visitors came to Northern Ireland, and a further 20 per cent increase is forecast for this year. Meanwhile, Northern Irish farmers are enjoying rising incomes, despite reforms to the common agricultural policy. The food processing industry appears to be adapting well to the cutbacks in intervention buying; instead, it is successfully exploring new markets within Europe. The continuing importance of agriculture to the economy can be appreciated from the fact that about 50 per cent of exports through the busy ro-ro (roll on, roll off) port of Larne are of agricultural produce. Economic analysts believe that any sustained recovery must await recovery elsewhere in the UK and Europe, and that the severe problem of long-term structural unemployment in the province has still to be adequately addressed. A regeneration of manufacturing industry is considered particularly important, to balance the declines in traditional industries such as shipbuilding, heavy engineering and textiles. The government insists that it is doing all it can; indeed, its Pounds 3bn annual subsidy to Northern Ireland has resulted in a housing and communications infrastructure that is now superior - or at least comparable  -to many other parts of the UK. Ministers argue that it is the IRA bombing campaign and the political violence which are holding back economic growth and the necessary private inward investment. Evidence for that can be found in the city of Londonderry - once the symbol of the 'troubles'. Here, local businessmen are brimming with confidence, 'power-sharing' on the local council has got the politicians working together for the city, and IRA bombs have not been heard for years. That is the picture of Northern Ireland which Mr Hume would like to see replicated in the rest of the province. If, indeed, his talks with Mr Adams are progressing as satisfactorily as he claims, then it need not be so far-fetched to imagine a very different outlook facing Northern Ireland in another year's time.

The dramatic announcement that 25 years of violence, which has engulfed the UK and several European countries, is to end with 'a complete cessation of military operations' was warmly welcomed in Dublin and Washington, and more hesitantly in London. At the same time the IRA's failure to comply with British and Irish demands to declare openly a permanent end to its armed campaign triggered an immediate note of caution from Mr John Major, the British prime minister. Mr Major, whose standing will be enhanced by an enduring peace, made clear the government would not contemplate allowing Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, into talks on Ulster's future until three months after it had become clear that violence had been renounced for good. 'I don't mind how it is expressed. . . but I do need to know that violence has ended for good and that it isn't a temporary ceasefire,' Mr Major said. Dublin, however, did not share Downing Street's caution. Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish premier, said he accepted the bona fides of the IRA. 'As far as I am concerned the war is over,' he said. 'There is now an historic opportunity to take the gun out of Irish politics for ever and to achieve a new and far-reaching political accommodation in a transformed atmosphere.' Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, brushed aside Downing's Street's reservations and called on Mr Major and unionist leaders to 'seize the moment'. The IRA leadership had 'courageously created an unprecedented opportunity which brings Anglo-Irish relations to a decisive point'. Mr Adams indicated it was up to the British government to make the next move. And he urged Britain to start the 'demilitarisation of the situation' by releasing Irish nationalist prisoners and withdrawing troops from Ulster. Republican sources were suggesting last night that, whatever London's view, the ceasefire was intended to be permanent. It was not clear, however, how or if this would be signalled. The prime minister acknowledged that the IRA decision represented 'a great step forward' but he moved to reassure unionists that there had been 'no secret deals, no secret understandings'. He added: 'Northern Ireland is part of the United Kingdom for so long as people in Northern Ireland wish to remain part of the UK. They will do so with the support of this government and I hope future governments.' The IRA announcement comes nearly nine months after the British and Irish governments signed the Downing Street declaration, which brought together the two countries in an unprecedented attempt to establish common ground for a political settlement in Ulster. The declaration, made shortly before Christmas 1993, followed talks between Mr Adams and Mr John Hume, leader of the mainly nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party. Mr Hume said he believed the republican movement wanted an end to the conflict which has claimed more than 3,000 lives in the last 25 years. Since December, both governments have insisted that the republican movement could be fully involved in the political process but only if it renounced violence for at least three months. Mr James Molyneaux, Ulster Unionist leader, echoed London's suspicions by calling on the IRA to take the 'modest but very vital step' of confirming a permanent end to violence. In spite of the government's public hard line on the IRA's omission of the word 'permanent' from its declaration, there were strong indications at Westminster last night of an early lifting of the broadcasting ban on representatives of Sinn Fein, including Mr Adams. US president Bill Clinton, who described the IRA statement as a 'watershed announcement', also called on the IRA to ensure that its violent campaign ended permanently. The US president yesterday spoke to both Mr Major and Mr Reynolds. Mr Clinton made clear his government's intention to assemble an additional aid package to help the peace process along. Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, said the British government intended to stick to its three-month 'probation' period before talks could begin on how to admit Sinn Fein to the political process. 'This is so important a matter that it ought not to be left at large or able to be the subject of discussion and argument,' Sir Patrick added. He said it was crucial that any future talks involving the IRA's political wing did not take place under the implied threat that violence could resume. Ministers will be hoping to avoid the threatened backlash by loyalist extremists. There were no signs last night that the loyalists intended to stop their campaign. Shots were fired in three separate incidents in Belfast and County Fermanagh shortly before the start of the ceasefire last night. There were no reports of injuries. Meanwhile, Ulster police were hunting a loyalist gang who murdered a 37-year-old Catholic after abducting him from a house in Antrim just hours before the IRA's ceasefire declaration. The outlawed Ulster Volunteer Force has claimed responsibility for the killing. The IRA ceasefire, Pages 10-11 Editorial Comment, Page 23   Countries:-  IEZ  Ireland, EC.

0,FT934-5857 ,"FT934-5857 _AN-DK1ACADCFT 931127   FT  27 NOV 93 / Reynolds wants summit plan for an end to Ulster violence      By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor   Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, yesterday set the creation of a joint UK-Irish framework for a permanent end to violence in Northern Ireland as the priority of his forthcoming summit with Mr John Major. His emphasis on securing an end to terrorism came as Mr James Molyneaux, the Ulster Unionist party leader, said it was possible that there could be 'significant developments over the weekend with regard to the terrorist situation'. He offered little explanation, but told his party executive in Belfast that more detailed information would be available early next week. As Mr Reynolds stepped up his campaign to reassure unionists in Northern Ireland of their veto over constitutional change, an opinion poll showed a majority of people in the Irish republic would support dropping their country's constitutional claim on the province. The poll, reported in the Irish Times, found that 51 per cent of those surveyed would agree to replace the claim with an aspiration, with 28 per cent against. Meanwhile, the UK government continued to hesitate over the timing of the summit, although Irish officials appeared confident that it would go ahead on Friday. There were also signs of important differences in the approach of the two governments to the summit. Mr Reynolds, who sent draft proposals to Mr Major on a possible framework for peace, wants the summit to concentrate on providing the background against which the IRA might declare an end to violence. That would involve a post-summit statement by the two leaders combining pledges to unionists on the constitutional integrity of the province with recognition of the legitimacy of the nationalist aspirations of the Catholic minority. It would also imply a further offer to Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, of an eventual place at the negotiating table in return for an end to violence. But Mr Reynolds' focus on the short-term possibilities for a halt to the IRA's military campaign conflicts with the much greater emphasis being placed by Mr Major on the need for a comprehensive political settlement. The UK prime minister has indicated that he is taking seriously the possibility that Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein leader, might be serious about ending the violence. However, amid growing alarm among moderate unionists about the direction of negotiations with Dublin, Mr Major wants the summit to provide the springboard for all-party talks on a political settlement. Mr Reynolds believes that should take second place to the peace process. Peace deadline, Page 7   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.     IEZ  Ireland, EC.

In his birthday speech to members of the Burmese opposition  groups gathered at Manerplaw yesterday, General Saw Bo Mya  reassured them the KNU will hold talks with the SLORC in  accordance with the principles laid down by the Democratic  Alliance of Burma [DAB]. Gen. Saw Bo Mya also stressed the need  for continued unity in the opposition movement. Larry Jagan, in  his report, noted the 12 students detained at Manerplaw were  released in view of this desired unity.    A report from the group leader of the All Burma Students'  Democratic Front [ABSDF] and other sources claimed ABSDF leader  Moe Thee Zun is now safe and secure. An opposition source at  the Thai-Burma border noted the KNU released the 12 students  detained on Sunday. The students also explained that the  misunderstandings have now been cleared. According to  yesterday's announcement of the National Council of the Union of  Burma [NCUB], which includes the armed minority groups,  students, and Dr. Sein Win's National Coalition Government of  the Union of Burma [NCGUB] -- a Burmese opposition group, the  students were not really detained but instead were holding talks  with KNU leaders. An opposition source said the KNU is worried  about students taking KNU-supplied arms out of KNU- controlled  areas, which they agreed not to do from the very beginning. The  NCUB announcement claimed no problems exists between the KNU and  the student armed wing and other allied groups.    An opposition source from the border explained the students  are getting very worried about their position since all the  opposition minority armed groups are holding peace talks with  the SLORC military government. According to the source, Gen.  Saw Bo Mya personally affirmed the students have nothing to  worry about and that they are always welcome. Gen. Saw Bo Mya  also guaranteed the safety of the students in KNU-controlled  areas. There is no doubt differences in opinion existed between  the students and the minority groups in connection with the  cease-fire talks. At a meeting held in Manerplaw a few days  ago, members of the NCUB emphatically stressed the need for  unity in the entire opposition movement. At present, although  some members still criticize and condemn the SLORC's peace talks  with individual groups, they also want to prevent the  disintegration of the opposition movement. All the member  groups understand that if the opposition movement disintegrates,  it will become favorable for the SLORC who desires to crush the  opposition.    The KNU leader, Gen. Saw Bo Mya, reiterated in his speech at  his 66th birthday celebrations held at Manerplaw yesterday, that  the KNU prefers all opposition groups to hold peace talks with  SLORC together. Gen. Saw Bo Mya noted, although the KNU will  hold peace talks, it will also discuss human rights issue, the  freedom of all national races, and other political problems with  the SLORC. He said the peace agreement reached separately with  various minority groups does not guarantee a true peace in  Burma. Next, Gen. Saw Bo Mya appealed to all other armed  organizations to work for national reconciliation and urged them  to participate in the roundtable peace negotiations with SLORC.  A KNU spokesman said no date has yet been fixed for the first  preliminary peace talks between the KNU and SLORC.    Although the KNU leader has been insisting the peace talks  be  held in Bangkok, most observers expect the talks to be held in  Yangon [Rangoon]. The Thai foreign minister, Prasong Sunsiri,  said yesterday the Thai Government will consider accepting the  peace talks proposal only when the SLORC government legally  informs the Thai Government.

Mr Reynolds was clearly disappointed at the decision of the British ambassador Mr David Blatherwick not to attend on the opening day. Downing Street said the ambassador declined because of the presence of Sinn Fein, with which London has not entered into exploratory talks. Mr Gerry Adams, leader of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, described the British move as petty: 'It's an indication of the British attitude not just to the peace process, but also to the Irish government.' In another remark unlikely to comfort London, Mr Reynolds appeared to link the issue of the 'disposal of arms' with a British decision to withdraw 'troops to barracks'. The forum gathering in Dublin Castle comprised leaders of the constitutional parties of the south, together with Sinn Fein, the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party and the non-sectarian Alliance party of Northern Ireland. Mr Reynolds said the forum would 'establish for the first time . . . some measure of agreement on future structures governing relationships within Northern Ireland, between north and south and between Ireland and Britain'. This referred to the three strands of the Anglo-Irish talks. Mr Reynolds also held out the prospect of a debate on constitutional change, as foreshadowed in the Downing Street declaration.

Now it is time  to revert to more orthodox methods.    With hopes of an early IRA response to the Downing Street  declaration fading fast, London has been trying to inject  momentum into the three-year-old talks process with Ulster's  nonviolent political parties.    It badly needs a success to prevent the impetus behind the  drive for a lasting settlement for the province from draining  away.    There are also hopes that progress in the political talks  might yet be the lever that eventually persuades republican  leaders to ditch the armed struggle and embrace the process. As  Dr John Alderdice, leader of the nonsectarian Alliance party,  puts it: ""As Sinn Fein sees the train drawing out of the  station, they may be prepared to jump on board.""    Yet a series of FINANCIAL TIMES interviews in recent days  with the leaders of the four main constitutional parties  indicates that many serious obstacles still stand in the way of  a positive outcome.    The leaders' comments, in brief, point to a long and  tortuous  process with success far from assured.    The words with which the Reverend Ian Paisley greeted the  announcement by the then Northern Ireland secretary Mr Peter  Brooke in March 1991 that a basis for formal political talks  existed still seem apposite.    ""The gate into the field has been opened,"" the leader of the  hardline Democratic Unionist party [DUP] said at the time.  ""But...there is a lot of hard ploughing in front of us.""    The main problem areas appear to be as follows:    The ""nothing is agreed until everything is agreed""  formula.    This, by definition, precludes the possibility of gradual  progress. Every syllable and punctuation mark has to be agreed  before anything can be set in stone.    Mr John Hume, leader of the mainly Roman Catholic Social  Democratic and Labour party [SDLP], regards the principle as  ""crucially important."" It ensures the talks address all the  relationships -- within Northern Ireland, between north and  south, and between the two governments, he says.    An agreement confined to the question of ""who wields power  in  Northern Ireland"" would not necessarily solve the province's  problems, Mr Hume believes.    Unionists favour a less ambitious framework paving the way  for a return to devolved government in Ulster, independent of  what might be agreed in the other two ""strands"" of the talks  process.    They point out that a blueprint for an Ulster assembly was  drawn up by a working party comprising all four constitutional  parties during the talks initiated by Mr Brooke.    Mr Paisley says openly that as far as he is concerned, the  formula no longer applies. It was exposed as a ""fallacy"" during  the ""failed"" Brooke talks process, he says.    How to handle the relationship between the north and  Dublin.    There is no disguising the fundamental differences between  the participants on this second strand of the talks process.    An Ulster Unionist party [UUP] document to be published this  month will argue that the relationship should be handled by ad  hoc meetings between Irish ministers and Ulster assembly  representatives.    But proposals implying that no separate north-south  institution -- such as a dedicated secretariat -- is necessary  would probably be anathema to the SDLP and to Dublin.    Mr James Molyneaux, the UUP leader, goes so far as to say:  ""Not only are the institutionalised bits unnecessary, but they  are unconstitutional. They would tend to tie elected  representatives from one part of the United Kingdom into  bargains-arrangements-undertakings without our sovereign  government being aware of it,"" he says.    The DUP's boycott of the talks.    Not only is Sinn Fein excluded from the talks process. So at  present is the DUP. While this could make agreement between  those who are participating less difficult to achieve, it might  also undermine its effectiveness.    As Mr Michael Ancram, the Northern Ireland minister, said  yesterday: ""A political settlement that brings peace is one  that has to have widespread acceptance.""    The current DUP line is that it will not return to the talks  until London explicitly rules out any possibility of a united  Ireland. According to one senior DUP official, London would  have to ""embark on a new security policy that demonstrates the  British are here to stay, irrespective of consent.""    The reluctance of some participants to move from  bilateral discussions back to a roundtable format.    After the experience of the Brooke talks, some are wary of  returning to what they see as the ""goldfish-bowl"" of roundtable  discussions.    There is though a general recognition that the current  time-consuming bilateral structure cannot continue indefinitely.    Mr Molyneaux favours ""a fair amount of commonality"" being  established before participants go back to sitting around a  table.    The two governments' apparent inability to prevent a  continuation of terrorism.    It is in Mr Hume's words ""quite obvious"" that the talks  process's prospects of success would be improved immeasurably if  they took place ""in an atmosphere of total peace.""    That is why the SDLP leader says he has pleaded for patience  in awaiting Sinn Fein's response to the joint declaration.  Continuing terrorist killings can only exacerbate tensions.    But can a cessation of violence be delivered even in the  event of an end to the IRA's 25-year campaign? Mr Paisley, for  one, is pessimistic.     "
0,FT944-74 ,"FT944-74 _AN-FAAACAC3FT 941231   FT  31 DEC 94 / On The Front Line: Adams' choice - War and Peace (Warmongers and Peacemakers)      By STEWART DALBY   One of Belfast's leading political commentators believes that the inspiration for Gerry Adams, the president of Provisional Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA and now, ostensibly, a peace broker in Northern Ireland, is Michael Collins, an IRA leader who, in 1920, agreed to the treaty partitioning Ireland. Collins was the IRA strategist and intelligence officer who made Ireland ungovernable between 1916 and 1919 through guerrilla warfare. But by 1920 he had come to the conclusion that independence could not be won by military means alone and agreed to sign the treaty. 'When you have sweated, toiled, had mad dreams, hopeless nightmares, you find yourself in London's streets cold and dank in the night air . . . Think] What have I got for Ireland. Something she has wanted these past 700 years? I tell you this - early this morning I signed my death warrant,' he reflected after signing. Sinn Fein split, Eamon De Valera leading the faction which resisted partition. A bitter civil war followed. Eighteen months later Michael Collins was dead, ambushed in Cork. It is always dangerous to push historical parallels too far. But Irish people of both main political persuasions are consumed with a sense of their past. What can be said is that Gerry Adams, some time during the late 1980s, became convinced that the military campaign was not going to lead to the goal of a British withdrawal from Ireland - and a united country under the jurisdiction of Dublin - and that another route should be tried. Thus the ceasefire. It could cost him his life. There is no shortage of rumours that the IRA will again split as it did in 1979 when he, among others, formed the Provisional IRA because the old IRA had grown weak and tired of the military struggle. For the moment, he has carried the day and, significantly, persuaded Martin McGuinness, the vice-president of Sinn Fein, over to the talks process. McGuinness is the overlord of Sinn Fein in Londonderry and thought to be the real hard man within the IRA. Adams was born in West Belfast in 1948. His family was steeped in Republicanism. He was believed by the security forces to be head of the Provisional IRA in the Ballymurphy area of West Belfast when he was interned in 1971. He was released in 1972 to take part in secret London talks between the provisionals and William Whitelaw, secretary of state, which gave rise to a brief ceasefire. In the resumed campaign he was believed by British intelligence sources to be Belfast brigade commander of the provisionals. He was arrested again and released in 1976. There after he moved steadily up the hierarchy. As president of Sinn Fein he continued the policy of the 'bullet and the ballot box'. The military campaign would continue, but it would run in parallel with a political campaign. For a while it worked. In 1983 in the aftermath of the hunger strikes of 1981, Gerry Adams won the West Belfast seat at Westminster. He refused to take the seat but used his victory to claim that Sinn Fein was overtaking the Social Democratic and Labour party, run by the moderate John Hume, as the true representative of the Catholic minority in the six counties. By the late 1980s the support had begun to wane. Gerry Adams lost his Westminster seat in 1992. By this time Adams had been in protracted talks with John Hume and covertly with the British government. It may well be that he has a sense of history and realises it is time to talk. He is a vain man and is thought to be over-weaningly ambitious and wants legitimate political power. He is also said to be tired of going around in a bullet-proof London taxi accompanied by minders.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P8651 Political Organizations.

0,FT941-2968 ,"FT941-2968 _AN-ECRDQAB9FT 940318   FT  18 MAR 94 / Trail cools in search for Ulster accord: David Owen on the breakdown in relations between the key players      By DAVID OWEN   Less than a month ago talks co-ordinated by London aimed at forging a lasting settlement for Northern Ireland were proceeding in a businesslike and constructive manner. Today the process is in effect on hold and the corridors of Westminster are thick with intrigue and recrimination. Whispering campaigns are under way against the leaders of the two largest political parties in the province. The speed and degree of the mood change must be disconcerting to those who confidently assert that the talks will move smoothly after a pause for the campaign for June's European elections and the 'marching season' which will follow in July. The odds are still that these optimists will be right. Some exchanges in yesterday's Saint Patrick's Day session of Northern Ireland questions in the Commons were positively playful, suggesting the situation could improve as rapidly as it has deteriorated. But the level of spleen vented, principally in private, between the main protagonists is already such that it may leave scars. Bridges burnt over the next three months in the interests of campaigning may not be as speedily repaired as some imagine. The whispering campaign against Mr James Molyneaux - some government loyalists are calling into question the Ulster Unionist party leader's tactics during the London-Dublin peace initiative - appears to stem from a cooling of his relations with Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary. This dates from London's decision last month to send Dublin a checklist of ideas covering relations in Ulster and between the province and the Irish government. Senior Ulster Unionists say this broke a pledge by ministers that they would be shown this document before anyone else. At the end of last month Mr Molyneaux showed his irritation by attacking Sir Patrick for 'to some extent torpedoing' the talks process. Senior Ulster Unionists say Mr Molyneaux subsequently declined to take a copy of the checklist offered to him by Sir Patrick at a private meeting, although other senior Ulster Unionists are now understood to be in possession of the document. London says Sir Patrick showed Mr Molyneaux the checklist, in common with the leaders of the other Northern Ireland parties engaged in bilateral discussions co-ordinated by Mr Michael Ancram, the Northern Ireland minister. The UUP has said it is willing to continue bilateral talks. Many observers argue that relations between the UUP and London were bound to cool given the party's anxiety to protect its flank against the hardline Democratic Unionist party ahead of the European elections. By this line of reasoning, UUP leaders were waiting for a pretext to force a rift. The UUP, for its part, has started to pursue its own whispering campaign - against Mr John Hume, the Social Democratic and Labour party leader - with renewed intensity. They say that he does not represent the views of his party in insisting that the 'nothing is agreed until everything is agreed' formula governing the talks must be adhered to come what may. Their aim is to isolate Mr Hume and bring about a situation in which an assembly, with safeguards to protect minority rights, could be set up in Northern Ireland, irrespective of whether agreement was possible on either north-south relations or relations between London and Dublin. A Lords debate on the province earlier this month showed that this view is not confined to Ulster Unionists. Lord Brookeborough, a Conservative peer, said: 'The SDLP looks not a little split with John Hume getting too close to Dublin and Sinn Fein for many of his party members' liking.' In the same debate Lord Fitt - who left the SDLP in 1979 and now calls himself an independent socialist - said the 'nothing is agreed . . . ' formula 'can only lead to the defeat of the whole operation'. Meanwhile, the DUP - sensing a chance to undermine the Downing Street declaration - has started to call for a united unionist front against the document. Mr Peter Robinson, the party's deputy leader, called earlier this week for all pro-union groups opposed to the joint declaration to form a co-ordinating unit to advance their case to government.

0,FT943-5388 ,"FT943-5388 _AN-EIECYAADFT 940905   FT  05 SEP 94 / PM demands guarantees of lasting ceasefire from IRA      By JAMES BLITZ   Mr John Major, the prime minister, yesterday insisted he needed a 'copper bottomed' guarantee from the IRA that its ceasefire was permanent before its political wing, Sinn Fein, could join talks on the future of Northern Ireland. He emphasised the government's cautious approach to the ceasefire declared last week by announcing that Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein leader, would continue to be barred from visiting Britain. The prime minister, speaking on BBC television, said Mr Adams would remain subject to a three-year exclusion order barring him from visiting the UK mainland, and that he did not expect this to be revoked 'in the next few months'. Mr Major's caution was in sharp contrast to that of his Irish counterpart, Mr Albert Reynolds, who is expected to meet Mr Adams this week to discuss Sinn Fein's participation in the Dublin-based Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, which would bring the Irish nationalist movement into talks with political parties in the republic. Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, will today meet Sir Patrick Mayhew, Britain's Northern Ireland secretary to try to resolve the differences between the governments' judgments of how to respond to the ceasefire. An Irish foreign ministry spokesman said: 'We understand the caution of the British government, but we hope that it is going to be cleared up shortly and that the meeting hopefully will contribute to that.' Sir Patrick said Irish nationalists had not yet made it clear that the violence had been permanently ended. Unionist politicians in Northern Ireland yesterday maintained their pressure on London to respond cautiously to the IRA's declaration. Mr Chris McGimpsey, honorary secretary of the Ulster Unionist party (UUP), said a cessation of IRA terrorism was simply a logistical statement whereas a permanent end to violence was a political statement. Mr Peter Robinson, deputy leader of the Democratic Unionist party, said the ceasefire terms had 'a get-out clause to renew the violence if they do not get concessions they are looking for.'

0,FT943-12276 ,"FT943-12276 _AN-EGZEHADXFT 940726   FT  26 JUL 94 / Leading Article: Next steps in Ulster   The news from Sinn Fein is, as ever, dire. The political wing of the Irish Republican Army announced, after lengthy deliberations on Sunday, that sections of the joint Irish-British peace declaration of December 1993 were 'negative and contradictory'. It could not, it said, accept what it called the 'Unionist veto' on a united Ireland. It declined to promise that IRA terrorism would cease, so that points of difference could be debated at the conference table. Clearly the IRA/Sinn Fein is fixated on the idea that, since it cannot persuade a majority of the people of Ulster to accept the governance of the Republic of Ireland, it must persist in its attempts to bomb them into submission. This strategy of the 'armed struggle' has failed for 25 years. It will fail even if it continues for another quarter of a century. There will not be peace until the IRA understands this. Sinn Fein leaders are adept propagandists. They talk misleadingly of a 'new phase in the peace process' while they simultaneously decline to call an end to violence. They are not, however, shrewd judges of the British character. The public is horrified at the long run of atrocities perpetrated by the IRA and, in recent years, the 'loyalist' paramilitaries. This does not mean that a policy of cut and run would be tolerated. The contrary is true. Any British government, of whatever colour, that left the people of Ulster in a state of chaos and civil war would be held in deep contempt. Its survival in office would be in doubt. Democratic basis The search for a political solution must therefore continue. The joint declaration provides a democratic basis for such a solution. Its cardinal principle is self-determination. Any party that wants a united Ireland must persuade a majority of the people of Ulster, as of the republic, to accept it. It is this principle that sticks in Sinn Fein's throat. So be it. The British and Irish governments should move quickly towards a new constitutional settlement. The other participants in this process are Northern Ireland parties that have renounced violence and are willing to attend talks. In essence this excludes the Unionist party led by the Reverend Ian Paisley as well as Sinn Fein. Progress towards a 'framework agreement' has been delayed for too long while waiting for the IRA to renounce violence and the Paisleyites to join the negotiations. Mr John Major could make this clear to Mr Paisley today. What is required now is a willingness on the part of all those who are in the talks to take risks. Each party to the process knows the leap of faith that is required; none has yet demonstrated a willingness to make the jump. The Ulster Unionists led by Mr James Molyneaux would assist if they entertained proposals for cross-border co-operation. Mr John Hume's mainly Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party should abandon the illusion that it can influence Sinn Fein. The details of Mr Hume's agreement with Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, should be published. It might expose the emptiness of the latter's protestations. Clear statement The British government could assist by presenting a draft amendment of the Government of Ireland Act. That would have to include a clear statement of intent to transfer sovereignty over Ulster should its people wish it. Such a statement would constitute a guarantee that Britain means what it says about self-determination. In return, the Irish government would be asked to bring forward counterpart amendments to articles 2 and 3 of the republic's constitution, so that the aspiration for a united Ireland contained in them would be tempered by phraseology to the effect that Ulster is recognised to be part of the United Kingdom unless its people decide otherwise. This last leap forward may be the most difficult for any of the parties concerned. All Irish political parties save Sinn Fein accept the Irish-British joint declaration. So does an overwhelming majority of the Irish people. Singling out the proposition that Ulster can decide on its own is, however, risky. Putting it to a referendum might backfire. People in the republic are uneasy when accused of leaving their northern cousins in the lurch. Yet if the peace process is to be accelerated, someone has to make the first move.

He also received the Brazilian Ambassador to  Portugal.    The audience granted to Alioune Blondin Beye lasted about 40  minutes. Beye arrived in Luanda today from South Africa where  he received assurances of the personal engagement of President  Nelson Mandela in the peace process.    [Begin recording] [Correspondent] I would like to know if  the  Angolan peace talks will be transferred from Lusaka to any South  African city.    [Beye] It is true that I was in Cape Town yesterday to meet  with President Mandela. It was, therefore, normal for me to  come to Luanda today to meet the president of the Republic. Our  meeting obviously centered on the peace process.    [Correspondent] We should not think that the peace talks  will  be transferred to South Africa, given the readiness expressed by  President Mandela?    [Beye] As you are aware, I have on several occasions visited  heads of state of countries neighboring Angola. The visit to  President Mandela, the president of a democratic South Africa,  is therefore normal. He can certainly contribute toward the  peace process.    [Correspondent] What will happen after 30 June, that is,  after the meeting of the UN Security Council?    [Beye] At present it is difficult to give a reply, because,  the UN Security Council is examining the situation in Angola and  as an international official, I cannot speak about a decision  that the UN Security Council has yet to take. I can say,  however, that the international community is concerned with the  Angolan problem and it will not remain indifferent.    [Correspondent] Mr. Beye, the war is intensifying in Angola  at a gigantic pace, while peace talks in Lusaka are moving at a  chameleon's pace. Is it possible to speak of deadlines in the  peace talks?    [Beye] That is true, but there was a worse situation in  August and September last year. Despite that, we began talks in  Lusaka and we have made progress. Last week Dr. Savimbi told me  that 90 percent of the work has been done. All the same, it is  also true that in the past days or weeks, the military situation  has deteriorated and this does not help the peace talks and the  humanitarian action.    [Correspondent] A last question, Mr. Beye. Only 10 percent  of the work remains to establish peace in Angola. Can we then  say that peace is a fait accompli, that the 10 percent will not  make the war continue?    [Beye] I am convinced that we can bring peace to Angola  because the Angolan people want peace. The role of the press is  to make the Angolan people believe in peace and in that way  peace will be irreversible. I know that we are facing very  difficult periods but I known that there will be light at the  end of the tunnel.

0,FT943-4039 ,"FT943-4039 _AN-EIKACAEAFT 940910   FT  10 SEP 94 / Message of hope and fellowship: The IRA's declaration of a ceasefire and the prospects of peace are important to many Americans. Nicholas Woodsworth visited an Irish society in Boston to see how the news was received      By NICHOLAS WOODSWORTH   Walk into the headquarters of the Emerald Society in a suburb of Boston, Massachusetts, and you will start to understand why the US president, Bill Clinton is so exercised about Ireland. This is a hall, soaked in Liffey-side nostalgia, with shamrocks and bright Kelly green curtains. It is the meeting place for one of the 4,000 Irish-American organisations. The number of US citizens claiming Irish descent has been growing rapidly and is now thought to have reached 44m. The sense of fellowship with their compatriots across the water has been a great source of strength for the republican cause in Northern Ireland - and a source of cash to arm the IRA terrorists. So the IRA's declaration of a ceasefire and the prospects of peace are a matter of some importance to a very large body of Americans. In Boston's Emerald Society hall they are men of substance: large of girth, loud of voice and confident of manner - the patrolmen, deputies, sheriffs and constables of the Boston city police force. They meet under an Irish flag at the front of the hall. A mural of the Irish Dail decorates one wall, the blazons of Ulster, Leinster, Munster and Connacht the other. But when at the society's meeting this week Constable Tom Brown made his way round the hall with copies of the US-published Irish Echo, the glow was dimmed. It was not that anyone present was unhappy with news of the IRA ceasefire but, if violence has come to a halt across the water, it has not stopped in Boston. Some officers were still in the ceremonial kilts, spats and argyll socks of the Boston Police's Gaelic Column, after the the funeral of a slain Boston policeman, the third to be killed in as many weeks. 'We are absolutely sick of violence,' said Brown. 'We have seen too much of it ourselves. It doesn't matter where policemen and innocent civilians are being killed. It must be stopped in Ireland, and at any cost.' Had Brown's views on the IRA been sounded out a decade ago his response, he admits, would have been very different. For many years he has been a member of Noraid, the Irish-American organisation responsible for much of the funding of IRA activities. Still a Noraid member, he acknowledges that Irish-American support for IRA violence has dwindled sharply, both emotionally and financially, in the last two or three years. Noraid, Brown says, now supports the ceasefire and will work for a negotiated settlement. If the price of peace is the Irish Republic's relinquishment of its territorial claim to Ulster, that, as far as Brown is concerned, is acceptable. 'Compromise is what it is all about,' he affirms. 'Both sides are going to have to bend.' The vast majority of policemen in the Emerald Society feel as Brown does - they have as much fear as any Americans of growing levels of violence, and no illusions as to its romance or benefits. 'I admit it, I was a Republican punk,' smiles policeman Dan Ring. 'I used to be a member of the Charlestown (a Boston suburb) Liberation Army. The CLA would go around spray-painting 'Kill the Brits' and persuading, more or less politely, local residents to contribute to the cause. That's all over - I grew up and became a cop. In 1992 I was on holiday in London when the IRA Christmas bombing campaign began. I was worried for the bobbies, for chrissake. Me, Irish Dan Ring] But a cop's a cop whoever and wherever he is. I still believe in uniting Ireland, but not by the gun.' If Irish-Americans have any hesitancy about the ceasefire, it is not generally based on any clear appreciation of the complexities of contemporary Irish economics or politics. They are instead felt at gut level, and are old ingrained views inherited over generations from forbears forced to emigrate from Ireland a century ago. Most reservations are expressed, now as they were then, in terms of mistrust of British intentions; as Americans the policemen of the Emerald Society freely admit that they wholly fail to understand religious division within the same ethnic community. But, as Americans, they are quick to come up with a simple solution that is neither political nor religious - most Emerald Society policemen believe, perhaps rightly, that a quick, large fix of money would do wonders for the old country. 'Ireland needs money, but it shouldn't come from the US tax-payer's pocket,' said 'Dapper' O'Neil, the conservative Tammany Hall-style Boston city councillor who, as the city's chairman of the committee on public safety, had come to address the Emerald Society after the funeral. 'We've got too many problems here and too many social programmes that are ruining the country.' Affirmative Action, the social programme that gives a head-start to disadvantaged minorities in the US, is not the way to go in Northern Ireland, Emerald Society members believe. They have seen it create too much bitterness against blacks in their own community. Nor is any other social aid programme likely to succeed. Instead, it is good old-fashioned private enterprise and investment that they believe offers Ulster its greatest chance. 'Look at the thousands of Americans who visit the Republic every year', notes policeman Jack Sheridan. 'Bill Clinton can't change Ireland. What will change Ireland is if there is a peace long enough to bring tourism, investment, jobs and prosperity.' Miles away, in downtown Boston, Irish-American businessmen seem to agree. At the Irish-American Partnership, a non-sectarian organisation claiming 7,500 US members and promoting employment and economic growth on both sides of the Irish border, Joseph Leary speaks enthusiastically of the 375 US company subsidiaries based in the Irish Republic; less than 40, on the other hand, are to be found in Ulster. That imbalance would change radically, he feels, if a stable political environment developed in the future. Will it? Most Irish Americans, given the enchantment lent by distance, believe some sort of point-of-no-return has been crossed. But the biggest problem, in former Charlestown Liberation Army policeman Dan Ring's view, is not international negotiation, US funding or British recalcitrance or any other external factor. 'It's the Irish themselves. I should know. We hate to give way. We are the stubbornest bastards in the world.'   Countries:-  USZ  United States of America.     IEZ  Ireland, EC.

0,FT934-7962 ,"FT934-7962 _AN-DKRC7AAIFT 931118   FT  18 NOV 93 / City groups raise Pounds 1m fund to counter IRA bombers      By JIMMY BURNS   LARGE City institutions have assisted in raising a Pounds 1m fund to help police reward those with information about IRA attacks on economic targets. The unprecedented move was announced yesterday by Scotland Yard with minimum details so as to protect the main sponsors from further terrorist attacks. In a rare example of an institution prepared to comment, the National Westminster Bank, whose City of London tower office was badly damaged in the last attack by the IRA on the City in April, said it strongly backed the initiative. The bank said: 'This is an important additional mechanism that will help pursue those responsible for terrorist attacks.' According to Scotland Yard, the initiative had been jointly developed over the past year by senior officers of its anti-terrorist branch S013 and top managers of UK-based companies. S013 has national UK mainland responsibility for conducting anti-terrorist operations together with MI5, the security service. Money already committed comes from dozens of unnamed companies throughout the country and will be administered by joint agreement between the police and the main sponsors. It is not clear yet if the full sum will be held in an escrow account or remain the responsibility of the companies until needed. The amount to be paid out at any one time will depend on the quality of the information. A spokesman for Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist branch said last night: 'Our experience is that we do not have to provide financial inducement to get useful information on terrorist activities. But if there is the slightest chance that an individual might be tipped over by a reward, then we should take it.' The initiative was prompted by business concern at the commercial costs of IRA attacks over the past two years in the City and elsewhere. Neither the Corporation of London nor the headquarters of the Confederation of British Industry in London would comment on the initiative. In Northern Ireland, the local business community will today back a trade union initiated 'community day of action' in support of peace. Mr Nigel Smyth, the CBI's Northern Ireland director, said there was a widespread feeling now that every effort should be made to bring violence to an end. 'People have to accept that we have to look to the future and we need compromise and understanding,' he said. Business leaders in the province are holding back from detailed political pronouncements for fear they might be targeted by terrorists. But significantly the CBI has not rejected any option for getting peace talks under way. Mates denies he talked to Sinn Fein, Page 8   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

0,FT943-6022 ,"FT943-6022 _AN-EIAD1ABNFT 940901   FT  01 SEP 94 / The IRA Ceasefire: Prize of peace in Ulster has never been closer      By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor   It may be too soon to celebrate. It is not too early for hope to displace the cynicism that has long suffocated politics in Northern Ireland. The prospects for a permanent peace remain uncertain. But the prize has never been closer since the present round of killings started 25 years ago. The grip of history has been loosened. Building a political settlement in a province where many are more frightened of peace than of war will not be easy. The misery inflicted on the people of Ulster by the mindless killings is matched only by the mutual mistrust across the sectarian divide. The habit of murder is deeply ingrained. Nor does it take much understanding of the past to appreciate that the objectives of the IRA and of the unionist majority are as irreconcilable today as they have ever been. After so many vicious murders over so many years, no one can be expected to take the IRA statement on trust. There was no mention of that most critical word - permanent. It may be that the present generation of republican leaders has given up hope of military victory. Certainly some in British intelligence share that view. History however - still an insidiously powerful force in Northern Ireland - reminds us that past ceasefires have split the republican movement. The killing has then resumed. The IRA remains as strong militarily as it has ever been. Some of its commanders will be looking for an opportunity to resume what they call the armed struggle. The response of the so-called loyalist paramilitaries - responsible in recent years for about half the killing in the province - will be crucial. The Rev Ian Paisley's warning of civil war was characteristically forthright. The hard-line Democratic Unionist leader is right, though, that the working-class Protestants need persuading that the price of peace has not been a weakening of Britain's commitment to the province. Mr John Major, the prime minister, and Mr Albert Reynolds, his Irish counterpart, have shown rare determination and grit in pushing the process this far. Mr Major, as beleaguered a prime minister as any in recent history, shrugged off the brickbats of colleagues who whispered behind their hands that last December's Downing Street declaration was destined to fail. He has gone as far as a Conservative leader could to rebuild trust with Ulster's nationalists and with the Dublin government. The personal risks have been considerable. So too have been his negotiating skills. Mr Major has managed thus far to avoid a backlash from the moderate majority among the unionists by ensuring that the door of 10 Downing Street has been ever open to Mr James Molyneaux, the leader of the Ulster Unionists. He has been rewarded by acquiescence, if not enthusiasm, from the leader of the province's most important political party. It will be harder now than it has ever been to sustain that careful political balancing act. But if the IRA statement does presage peace, Ireland could rescue Mr Major's premiership. Both prime ministers will have to take more risks. There will be many calling themselves Catholics or Protestants determined to wreck the initiative. There will be strains between London and Dublin. The contrasting tone of the responses in the two capitals underlines the danger. The understandable euphoria in Dublin was not echoed in Downing Street. Mr Major's statement spoke in more measured terms of the need to confirm that this is more than a pause in the killing. The risk is that an ambiguous ceasefire will create a rift between London and Dublin; that Mr Reynolds will be too eager to respond quickly to the IRA statement and that Mr Major will be unduly cautious. The political compromises behind the Downing Street declaration and the search for a new constitutional framework for Ulster would then be threatened. Some in Whitehall believe that has been the IRA's game-plan all along. So the two governments must stick firmly to their public pledge that there will be a place at the negotiating table for Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, only when it is clear the renunciation of violence is irrevocable. The fundamental principle on which co-operation between London and Dublin has been based is that of consent - in short, it is (and always will be) for the people of Northern Ireland to decide their own future. For all his government's protestations that nothing has changed in its attitude to the future of Ulster, Mr Major has moved in the direction of the nationalists. He has made explicit what has been implicit, but carefully hidden, in the approach of successive governments since 1973 - that Britain has no 'selfish or strategic' interest in maintaining Ulster as part of the union - it will do so only if and for as long as a majority in the province so wish. For his part Mr Reynolds has been obliged to admit the legitimacy of the unionist veto - that the nationalists' longstanding demand for self-determination in Ireland cannot override the wishes of a majority in Northern Ireland. That principle must remain inviolate. If Mr Major steps just an inch over the line dividing neutrality from persuasion he will lose the support of moderate unionists and face a backlash on his own back benches. In his understandable enthusiasm to ensure that the chance of peace is not lost, Mr Reynolds must be careful to ensure that reassurances to the unionists offered by London are not undercut by nationalist triumphalism in Dublin. Every step for the next few weeks will be an awkward one. There are ways in which the British government can respond quickly to the cessation of violence - by lifting the broadcasting ban on Sinn Fein, by changing the pattern of policing in Northern Ireland - which involve few risks. But it cannot allow the slightest hint that its actions are being driven by the threat of a resumption of IRA killing. Mr Major and Mr Reynolds must move quickly to finalise the outline plans for a political settlement they have been promising since early summer. The shape is clear - dilution of the republic's constitutional claim to Northern Ireland, changes in Britain's 1920 Government of Ireland Act to enshrine the principle of consent, a devolved Northern Ireland assembly and new cross-border institutions to build trust. It is talks on this document that Sinn Fein will be invited to join if in, say, two or three months' time the IRA has proved its good intent. You do not have to search too hard around Westminster to find those confident that even if the process gets that far, the nationalists' demand for a united Ireland and the determination of the Protestant majority to sustain the union will quickly restore the familiar deadlock. History is on the side of the cynics. But this time there is a decent chance the future will not be a prisoner of the past. The police said yesterday that 3,168 people had died in the sectarian terror which has engulfed Northern Ireland for 25 years. Maybe, just maybe, that is enough even for the IRA.

He said he was under no political or personal pressure to do so. Mr O'Malley, 54, said he would stand for election one more time before quitting politics altogether. He did not say what his long-term plans were. A long-time opponent of Mr Charles Haughey within Fianna Fail, he split with the party leader in 1984, when Mr Haughey had him expelled for publicly differing with him on Northern Ireland, the contraception issue and internal party democracy. He founded the Progressive Democrats (PDs) in 1985, presenting it as the party of high standards and open government. The party has since had an influential minority voice holding the balance of power with six out of 166 Dail seats in the coalition government from 1989 to 1992. It was Mr O'Malley's decision to withdraw his party's support from Fianna Fail in January 1992, as a series of political and business scandals began to wash over Mr Haughey, then the prime minister, that precipitated Mr Haughey's resignation and the formation of a new Fianna Fail-PD coalition, under the leadership of Mr Albert Reynolds. Mr O'Malley has been one of the principal proponents of dropping the republic's constitutional claim to Northern Ireland and, as a member of the government negotiating team to the 'round-table' talks on the province during 1992, clashed with his Fianna Fail colleagues in the negotiations, who insist that any constitutional change should only be made as part of an overall settlement. He then fell out with Mr Reynolds over contrasting evidence the two men gave to the tribunal of inquiry into the beef industry between June and October of 1992. It was this disagreement which led to the collapse of the coalition and a general election. The tribunal, which was set up to investigate allegations of fraud, malpractice and political favouritism in Ireland's huge beef industry, concluded last summer after sitting for two years.

Rabin tells settlers that there will be no Palestinian  state, that the settlements illegally established in the  occupied territories will not be dismantled, that there will be  no withdrawal from occupied Jerusalem, that Israel will not  abandon its racism, and that Israel will not recognize the  Palestinian people's national rights.    AL-BA'TH adds: At the same time, Rabin is being generous to  the world public opinion by giving it some analgesics by saying  that 1994 will be the year of achieving peace in the Middle East.    AL-BA'TH says: Rabin came with his party majority to the  Knesset under the banner of peace to replace Shamir, who  obstructed, hampered, and froze the peace process, and brought  tension to U.S.- Israeli relations with his crude rejection of  U.S. proposals. It is known that the most important promises  Rabin gave to Israeli voters -- who are sick of the policy of  wars, military invasions, occupation of others' land, rebellion  against international legitimacy, and rejection of several  initiatives to establish peace in the region -- was his  commitment to deviate from Shamir's method and to cooperate with  the United States to reactivate the peace process and to enable  it to achieve its objectives.    The paper says: Had it not been for the Geneva meeting  between President Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clinton and its  positive results which paved the way for embarking on new  attempts to resume the peace talks, these talks would have  remained frozen, not to say halted.    The paper clarifies: Every time Syria removes an Israeli  mine from the road of peace, Rabin's government plants new  mines. Every time Syria makes a step to push the peace process  forward, Israel takes several steps backward. These steps have  forced it to leave the peace process and its talks in Washington  for the corridors of secret talks in Oslo.    The paper holds Rabin and his government fully responsible  for obstructing and foiling the peace talks in Washington and  for planting mines on their road.    Concluding, AL-BA'TH says: Unless the Israeli obstacles are  seriously and decisively surmounted, the peace process will  continue to be exposed to further erosion, destruction, and  collapse, and the talk about peace, stability, and security in  the region will be sheer imagination and deception.    The newspaper AL-THAWRAH says: Israeli officials often  resort to making provocative and skeptical statements to play  down the importance of the peace process and to give pessimistic  impressions about the possibility of reaching a just and  comprehensive peace in the Middle East. They try to draw a very  dark and melancholic picture for the future of the peace process  in order to achieve their objective of making others believe  that peace can only be achieved in accordance with the Israeli  concept, namely, that the Arabs should relinquish their land and  rights and accept partial solutions and separate deals tailored  in accordance with Israel's expansionist objectives. The paper  quotes a recent statement by Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq  Rabin in Madrid in which he described the peace talks as being a  bazaar and a commercial deal.    AL-THAWRAH says: If this is Yitzhaq Rabin's concept of the  talks, no one can be optimistic about the approach of peace.  Neither can anyone claim the peace talks are proceeding in the  right direction.    The paper clarifies: Peace, in its humanitarian sense,  cannot be compared with a commercial deal that is subject to  compromise and blackmail and which can take place at the expense  of one party. Such a description shows a backward mentality that  is not in harmony with the contemporary international trend that  considers peace a pressing need necessitated by security,  stability, and justice in the world.    Concluding, the paper says: If Rabin attacks Syria due to  its insistence on the need for a just and comprehensive peace in  the Middle East, due to its rejection of partial solutions and  separate deals, and due to its commitment to restoring the  occupied Arab territories in full, he should realize that  Syria's policy will continue to be clear and firm, and that no  one can divert it from its objectives and principles.

I believe the peace process is moving forward. Not  spectacularly, but moving forward steadily, and we have to  continue the efforts of he OPAPP (Office of the Presidential  Adviser on the Peace Process) and try to see if we can still  further accelerate the pace of the peace process. But it is  doing quite satisfactorily, and it is a factor in the  improvement of the peace and order situation. That's why the  president is really keen on seeing to it the peace talks of all  the three panels will be further enhanced. On our part, on the  part of the panel dealing with the MNLF (Moro National  Liberation Front), we will have our second mixed committee  meeting in Zamboanga after holy week and then in the middle of  the month of April we go to Jakarta for the second round of  formal talks.    Exactly how will do you propose to accelerate the pace  of the peace process?    On the part of the holding of the peace talks, we will  depend  on the chairmen of the other two panels also to try to dispose  of the obstacles in the way of the holding of exploratory talks  or resuming the ongoing negotiations insofar as the military  rebels are concerned.    When you say the peace process is moving forward, this  statement seems to apply only to the talks with the MNLF.    That is why as I said the president has appealed to the  other  chairmen to try to ride over the existing obstacles there are in  the way of having formal negotiations or resuming the  negotiations if they have been stalled. And that's the reason  why he said we should not rely so much on legal technicalities.  We have to do everything in order to move the talks.    There are now reportedly three communist rebel  groups.    So far the panel of Ambassador (Howard) Dee is dealing with  the main group headed by Joma (Jose Maria) Sison and Mr. (Luis)  Jalandoni. Because Jalandoni has been recognized as their chief  negotiator and spokesman. So that's why Ambassador Dee is doing  his best.    Are there any concrete plans to start dealing with any  of the rebel factions?    Maybe later on. Just like our panel: we are now having  talks with the MNLF, but we are also committed to later on  negotiate with the MILF. Because these are all elements of our  society so we have to try to do our best to have talks with them  and to have an agreement with them and come to terms with them.  That's the only way we can have peace, really, because these  are all elements of Philippine society, the Philippine community.    How long do you think the peace process will take?  Oh... Another six years?    I don't know. We cannot really give a time cap on these  negotiations. In our case, you know that the Tripoli Agreement  was signed in 1976. So we are now still in the process of  elucidating and clarifying the issues that remain to be  discussed, for further or later discussion.    How will you deal with the apparent impatience of some  groups, such as the RAM [Rebolusyonaryong Alyansang Makabansa;  Nationalist Revolutionary Alliance] which has repeatedly rated  the pace of the peace process as too slow.    All we can say is we would like to conclude these  negotiations as soon as possible. But as I said it's very  difficult to put an exact date.    On what does the success of the peace process depend  on?    It will hinge first of all on the sincerity and  determination  of both panels in each of these areas to really move the talks  forward. Secondly, it will depend also on the support given to  the holding of these talks by all agencies of government, the  bureaucracy.    And then in the final analysis, it will depend on all the  support given to it by the people themselves -- by the NGOs  [nongovernmental organizations], and the people in the different  communities.    And that's why on our part, for instance, in the panel  dealing with the MNLF, we want to have different meetings, in  different places in Mindanao. That has the beneficial effect of  acquainting the people in each of these areas with the ongoing  peace process.    How can the people interact?    For instance, in making preparations for the holding of the  talks in certain communities, we first contact the local  officials, and then inform them of the site where the talks will  be held. Later on, when the talks are going on, both panels,  will have the opportunity to meet with people's organizations,  the NGOs. For instance before, Congresswoman Lobregat in  Zamboanga City had objected to our holding talks there. Now  they have offered to host, and Congresswoman Lobregat is even  offering her own place for the second meeting.    How will your new job as acting chief of the OPAPP  affect the talks with the MNLF?    It will certainly help because first of all it enhances my  own status in the eyes of the MNLF and also in the eyes of the  Indonesian government.    We have already established a close rapport with Nur Misuari  and I'm sure he will welcome this development and he will be  happy to deal with us better.    What extra powers or authority come with the  office?    The extra authority is, I have the authority now to  supervise  and coordinate the talks of the other panels.    Will it give you more power to offer concessions to the  MNLF?    No. Whatever concessions I will offer will still have to  depend on the president. Because he was the one who made that  commitment that we are going to elevate the talks to a higher  level in order to show his commitment to the peace process as a  whole and to the success of our negotiations with the MNLF.    What is the ideal role of the presidential adviser on  the peace process?    The ideal role? The role of the presidential adviser on the  peace process covers a very wide scope, so it is difficult to  put the pin on just one area. But in general we have to see to  it that there will be a satisfactory progress in the area of  negotiations with the three groups.    Secondly, we also have to look after the welfare and  rehabilitation of those who will decide to surrender and come  within the fold of the law. In our case, one of our primary  objectives in the talks with the MNLF is to attain the objective  of their return to Philippine society as members of the  community.    Will there be any major policy changes with regard to  the peace process?    I don't think there will be any major changes in policy. We  will have to follow the same guidelines and policies that have  been prescribed by the president to the defunct NUC (National  Unification Commission) and the OPAPP since it was set up last  year.    The negotiation panels have their own respective  instructions  from the president and I intend to sit down with the other two  chairmen in order to get a more detailed briefing of the  progress of their negotiations and how they come up to the  compliance with instructions to the president.    On our part we have our own manual of instructions which  have  been approved by the president.    What innovations, new ideas will you introduce at  OPAPP.    I still have to go to my of office. After I take my oath of  office I'll go there and get a feeling of the set up there.    What is important is first of all to motivate the people in  the OPAPP to discharge their duties not only properly but with  the proper spirit. And the same goes for all the personnel  involved in the peace process.    Later on I'll contact also the other agencies in the process  like the convenors in the provinces and the representatives of  the different sectors.    Won't your duties at OPAPP take up too much of your  time which would in turn adversely affect the talks with the  MNLF?    I don't think so because there is an existing office  organization there, a secretariat, and as a matter of fact they  have been working in that line of activity since a few years  ago, since the time of Cory [President Corazon Aquino], that  group was there. Then they were converted to NUC when President  Ramos came in and now the OPAPP. But more or less the key  people are there.    What are the remaining obstacles to the peace  process?    Well they're not really obstacles. Maybe we really have to  find out whether there are adequate funds and resources for the  further advancement of the peace process. Now when I say  further advancement we want the acceleration of the peace  process because we want the peace process to be able to  contribute meaningfully towards our economic takeoff especially  in Mindanao. Mindanao is part of the East Asean Growth Polygon  that President Ramos wants. So if we want the Growth Polygon to  really become a working concept then we have to do our part in  achieving that comprehensive, just and lasting peace in Mindanao.    And the other two elements, the other two negotiating  panels,  the same: whatever will enhance the peace and order and  security situation in the Philippines will certainly help in  further improving our economic image.    What will the additional funds be used for.    We need funds for the conduct of the talks, and funds for  the  rehabilitation of those who will apply for amnesty, funds for  the conduct of consultations with the communities all over the  country.    Is the budget for the peace process inadequate?    Well in our experience, the budget that we have requested is  adequate but we would like to request for more prompt and speedy  release of funds.    Rebel personalities often accuse government of  insincerity. Exactly how will government convince them of its  sincerity?    That is also a two-way proposition. As they say it takes two  to tango. If one side perceives insincerity then of course the  other side will have to make extra effort to prove that they are  sincere in holding these talks. That is the key, precisely, to  the success of the negotiations: the sincerity and  determination of both sides to proceed with the talks in order  to attain success. Because success will redound to the interest  of both sides.    Does government have any new ideas on how convince, for  example, Luis Jalandoni and Jose Maria Sison?    What I am sure of is Ambassador Dee and members of his panel  are really very sincere and determined and keen on meeting with  the NDF/CPP/NPA [National Democratic Front/Communist Party of  the Philippines/New People's Army] panel. Only that there have  been some extraneous issues introduced into the picture. For  instance, they are supposed to have these exploratory talks. I  see no reason why we cannot have that, it's just exploratory.  But right now they are involved in discussion of issues, like  the Constitution.    What about the RAM?    The RAM now is willing to go back to the negotiating table.  They had been holding formal negotiations already but they are  suspended because of some demands on the part of the RAM. But  now I think they have become aware of their commitment also to  participate in these peace talks, to move it forward.    How will government prevent them from withdrawing  again?    Mayroon silang mga hiningi [They have], certain demands, so  the panel is now studying how to meet some of these demands  without sacrificing our integrity and our sovereignty and  provided they are done within the framework of our laws. If it  is within the scope of the law, I see no reason why the  Philippine panel will not agree to it.    Can government continue to bend over backwards just to  entice rebel groups to participate in peace negotiations?    On our side we are going on with our discussions, whatever  agreements have been reached were all within the framework of  our laws. So that's our principal guidance.    I know they are now studying the requests of the RAM to see  how far they can meet the requests -- still within the framework.    What can we expect from the peace process. Will there  be any concrete developments within the year?    Within the coming year we would expect a little more, some  more developments.    Do you foresee formal talks with the NDF occurring  within the next six months?    Well, formal talks in the case of the panels which are  already in it and in the case of other panels, exploratory talks.    Will exploratory talks with the NDF begin within the  next six months?    Yes, I think it's very probable that can be brought about.     "

Mr Reynolds said the Irish government employed 'all means' at its disposal to combat terrorism.

It is simply that the Irish government want to achieve it by peaceful means, and the IRA otherwise.' Mr Dick Spring, Irish foreign minister, has tried to reassure Unionists that Ireland's constitutional claim could be re-negotiated as part of a wider political settlement.

Public opinion here considered King Husayn's visit as being  successful and yield [words indistinct] economic, political and  military fields.    During his visit, King Husayn held separate talks with U.S.  President Bill Clinton, Secretary of State Warren Christopher  and other high-ranking officials on the bilateral relations, the  situation in the Middle East region, the latest developments in  the peace process, especially on the Jordanian-Israeli track,  and the economic and military cooperation between the two  countries.    The talks aimed at bolstering the bilateral relations and  boosting trust and understanding between Jordan and America.    Political observers here stressed that this visit  contributed  to identifying the viewpoints of Jordan and the U.S. on the  peace process.    The visit came in the light of remarkable progress on the  Jordanian-Israeli track of peace talks on the demarkation of the  border lines, water quotas and security along with other issues.    King Husayn highlighted his commitment to his positive  attitude toward the Jordanian-Israeli peace talks, voicing his  readiness to meet Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin at a  suitable time.    Jordan's positive attitude, which came at a time when the  peace talks on the Syrian-Israeli track has been deadlocked  since the Hebron massacre in February, is highly-appreciated by  the American side which deems it as a courageous step.    This indicates that Jordan is trying to assure the U.S. that  it is still playing an important and indispensable role in the  peace process.    On the other hand, the American side needs a new progress on  the Jordanian-Israeli track to reactivate the stalemated talks  on the Syrian-Israeli track, and then to put the  Lebanese-Israeli talks on the right track.    King Husayn made it clear that his country still endeavors  to  reach a just and comprehensive settlement for the Arab-Israeli  dispute and will not sign any peace deal with Israel without  securing progress on the other Arab-Israeli tracks.    He pointed out that Jordan seeks to safeguard its national  interests as well as the pan-Arab common interests.    The American side voiced its support for the Jordanian  tendency and its commitment to reaching a just and comprehensive  settlement in the Mideast region, thus enabling Jordan to  coordinate its stance with the other Arab sides.    King reviewed with the U.S. officials the economic problems  Jordan faces now due to the Gulf war, pointing out that this  situation is incompatible with the role played by Jordan now.    He called on the American side to extend economic and  military aid to Jordan to enable it to get out of the economic  crisis and play more positive role in the Mideast peace process.    The American side voiced its understanding and sympathy  toward this call.    Bill Clinton pledged his support for Jordan to alleviate the  burdens of its due debts to the U.S. amounting to about 1  billion U.S. dollars.    The U.S. Administration will support the Jordanian economic  development and meet the Jordanian security prerequisites in  view of the progress achieved in the peace process, Clinton  pledged.    He also pledged to help convince the Western creditors to  reschedule Jordan's some 6 billion dollars debts due to them.    The positive results secured by the visit of King Husayn to  the U.S. will necessarily activate the Middle East peace process  and help Jordan play greater role in this process.    Political observers anticipate a new progress to be secured  on the Jordanian-Israeli track of peace talks relating to  border-line demarkation and water quotas.     "
0,FT934-7329 ,"FT934-7329 _AN-DKUAIAAHFT 931120   FT  20 NOV 93 / Divisions over Ulster exposed by Dublin leak      By TIM COONE and DAVID OWEN   THE GAP between the British and Irish governments over the shape of a constitutional settlement for Northern Ireland was underlined yesterday by a document setting out Dublin's terms. A draft position paper leaked to an Irish newspaper confirmed Dublin's intention to drop its territorial claim over Northern Ireland and acknowledged there could be no change in the province's status without the consent of a majority of the population. But in return it sought British acknowledgement of the legitimacy of the goal of Irish unity 'by agreement' and consent to a marked extension of Dublin's role in the province. This would be exercised through a strengthened Anglo-Irish inter-governmental conference and new north-south institutions with executive powers. The leak  - coming just a day after Mr John Major, the prime minister, reinforced his personal commitment to a settlement  - embarrassed the Irish government and annoyed Downing Street. Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, quickly disassociated himself from the paper, whose authenticity was confirmed by the Irish foreign ministry. Mr Reynolds said no such document had been presented to the Dublin government. The paper had 'no connection whatso-ever' with the peace initiative. Neither Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, nor Downing Street would comment yesterday on the substance of the document. But the interventionist tone of some proposals would almost certainly be unacceptable to London. There also seems little prospect of Downing Street agreeing to an inter-governmental body with powers as wide-ranging as Dublin envisages or to entrust the proposed north-south institutions with developing an integrated approach to the European Union. Unionists were yesterday already balking at the paper's emphasis on 'enhancing' the co-operative structures of the 1985 Anglo-Irish agreement. Mr Ken Maginnis, security spokesman for the Ulster Unionist party, said it was 'presumptuous' for Dublin to take such a 'divisive' approach to a delicate problem. The Reverend Ian Paisley, leader of the hardline Democratic Unionist party, said: 'We are moving to Mark Two of the Anglo-Irish agreement.' The two governments did not want to 'consult the people' at all. 'Until we deal with Articles 2 and 3 (of the Irish constitution which lay claim to Northern Ireland) there can be no progress.' Sir Patrick said the paper was 'not a document we have received' and it would be futile for him to speculate on it. The Northern Ireland secretary met briefly with Mr Reynolds and Mr John Hume, leader of the Social Democratic and Labour Party, at a conference in Londonderry. Mr Hume said he would shortly meet Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, to brief him on his recent talks with Mr Major.

The talks are to be chaired by Joe Clark, the former Canadian prime minister, now United Nations special envoy on Cyprus. Both leaders have agreed to a UN plan on confidence-building measures to improve relations between the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities. These would include re-opening Nicosia airport and giving the Greek side access to Varosha, a suburb of Famagusta, after almost 20 years.

0,FT943-14084 ,"FT943-14084 _AN-EGQAAAAQFT 940716   FT  16 JUL 94 / Rabin to meet Hussein at US summit      By JULIAN OZANNE and GEORGE GRAHAM      JERUSALEM, WASHINGTON   The Arab-Israeli peace process gathered pace yesterday as the US announced the first public summit between the Israeli and Jordanian leaders and as Israel made substantial overtures to Syria on the eve of a Middle East peace shuttle by Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state. President Bill Clinton said Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, would meet King Hussein of Jordan in Washington on July 25. The two neighbouring states have technically been at war since 1948. The announcement, confirmed by Mr Rabin's office, came after Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, said the Jewish state recognised the sovereignty of Syria over the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. Mr Peres made the remarks in an apparent attempt to break the deadlock in talks before Mr Christopher arrived in the region on his third shuttle this year. Taken together, the two moves represent a significant further step in Arab-Israeli negotiations. Mr Clinton said the summit would be 'another step toward the achievement of a comprehensive and lasting peace in the Middle East'. The US plans to lay on a full ceremonial fanfare for the occasion. Mr Clinton said that in addition to their meeting, Mr Rabin and King Hussein would be invited to address a joint session of Congress. They will also attend a formal dinner at the White House. In Israel the Rabin-Hussein meeting is expected to bolster both the government and public support for the peace process. The summit will be seen as one of the first concrete benefits from peace talks with Palestinians and a step to ending Israel's regional isolation despite a 13-year-old 'cold peace' with Egypt. For Jordan the move marks the determination of King Hussein not to be left out of the unfolding Middle East peace process and to press Jordan's interests ahead of wider Arab co-ordination, particularly with Syria. As an inducement to Jordan to move ahead in its peace talks with Israel, the US is discussing possible debt relief measures as well as the supply of new military equipment. The announcement of the Rabin-Hussein summit came after Jordanian and Israeli officials ended technical talks yesterday to prepare for formal negotiations next Monday. The preparatory talks also laid the groundwork for a meeting in Jordan on Wednesday between Mr Christopher, Mr Peres and the Jordanian foreign minister to focus on economic relations and regional integration projects. Progress in peace talks between Israel and Jordan will marginalise Damascus and put pressure on Syrian President Hafez al-Assad to compromise in talks over the Golan Heights. Israeli officials said yesterday that Mr Peres' acceptance of Syrian sovereignty over the Heights marked a 'far-reaching' concession to Damascus. Israel annexed the strategic plateau in 1981. They said Mr Peres had attempted to offer a ground-breaking opening in the talks which have been stalled by Israeli refusal to say how much land it would return and Damascus' refusal to specify whether it would agree to a full peace including open borders, trade and embassies. Mr Christopher will also meet Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, to review the implementation of the Israel-PLO peace agreement. He said he would discuss 'the steps that I feel he must undertake to establish the accountability necessary to reassure the donor community'. Mr Clinton said the Rabin-Hussein meeting was 'another step' on the long road to an era of Middle East peace. 'I will do everything I can to make sure the peoples of the region realise the blessings of peace that have been denied too long to them.'   Countries:-  ILZ  Israel, Middle East.

The initiative, launched 11 days ago in Belfast, is aimed at ending the paramilitary violence in Northern Ireland. Mr Hume spent almost two hours explaining the initiative to Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, and Mr Dick Spring, the foreign minister. Mr Reynolds said afterwards: 'John Hume gave us a document setting out the broad principles, which all of us agree could be a just and a lasting peace process to be established and worked upon. We will evaluate what we have heard today with our colleagues in government and we will consider how, in our discussions with the British government, this can contribute to the building of a peace process.' Government officials confirmed that the document was the same report referred to by Mr Hume and Mr Adams in their joint statement launching the peace initiative. The foreign ministry said: 'We will certainly contemplate discussing it with the British government as part of a wider process leading to a settlement (on Northern Ireland)'. Mr Reynolds said the document itself would not be presented to the British government. Mr Hume said: 'I gave a very detailed briefing on a strategy for peace that I believe now exists and I am quite happy with the (government) response.' Neither he nor the Irish government is likely to release any further details of the initiative. Mr Hume appealed to the media for patience, saying: 'The less speculation and more confidentiality the better. As they showed in Norway (in the Middle East peace process) secrecy helped create agreement there.' The Northern Ireland Office did not wish to comment, but Mr Ken Maginnis, deputy leader of the Ulster Unionist party, was deeply suspicious of the secrecy surrounding the initiative. 'Is it reasonable that we should be expected to react positively on the basis of some hypothetical document that in fact was probably cobbled together on the way back from John Hume's trip to America?' he asked. The Irish cabinet is to discuss the proposals next Tuesday. Mr Reynolds said on Wednesday he believed any negotiated settlement should be put to a 'simultaneous' referendum north and south of the border, but he reaffirmed the Unionists' effective right to veto any new constitutional arrangement for the province, as established in the 1985 Anglo-Irish treaty.

The government, meanwhile, has agreed to meet  representatives  of the communist-led National Democratic Front (NDF) before  holding the next round of exploratory talks in Vietnam.    Howard Dee, chair of the government peace panel, however,  urged the NDF to remove all preconditions for the Vietnam talks,  saying these were contrary to The Hague Declaration signed by  the two parties last year.    ""We...condemn the dastardly act of bombing sacred places,  the  church and the mosques of Davao City,"" Misuari said at the  resumption of government-MNLF talks in Timbangan town.    Misuari told Bangsa Moro [Moro Nation] supporters he will  not  allow anybody to sabotage the talks. He said the MNLF units in  Davao City were ready to go after the persons responsible for  the bombings of the Davao cathedral and mosques.    Also attending the affair were Representative Eduardo  Ermita,  government peace representatives, and observers from the  Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC) of Six led by  Indonesian Ambassador Yusbar Jamil.    The perpetrators of the bombings ""...will not succeed, as  unity and peace in Mindanao will be achieved and will reign,"" he  said.    Meanwhile, the GRP [government of the Republic of the  Philippines]-MNLF ""mixed"" support committees which convened  Tuesday noon named the cities of Zamboanga, Cotabato, Marawi,  General Santos and Manila as the next venues for the peace talks.    The schedules are: cease fire committee -- 5, 6, 7, January,  Zamboanga City; defense -- 10, 11, 12 January, Cotabato City;  administration -- 13, 14, 15 January, Manila; shariah -- 17,  18, 19 January, Marawi City, and 27, 28 29 January, General  Santos City; economics -- 20, 21 January, Zamboanga City; and ad  hoc -- 7, 8, 9 February, Zamboanga City.    The ""mixed"" committees will meet in Zamboanga City, but the  dates have not yet been agreed upon.    The ad hoc committee is headed by Interior Undersecretary  Alexander Aguirre, with Ermita, Makabankit Lanto, Baltazar Sator  and Department of Justice Undersecretary De Castro as members.    Heading the five MNLF committees are Lieutenant General  Thambayopha Manjoarsa, defense and security; Dr. Jawali Laja,  education; lawyer Jose Lorena, finance, mines and resources;  lawyer Didagen Dilangalen, administrative; and Ustadz Shariff  Zain Jali, judiciary and shariah.    The OIC was represented in the Timbangan meeting by  Ambassador Jamil, Libyan Ambassador Abdulaziz Azzaroukh and  Indonesian Consul Colonel Muhammad Zaini.    In a press statement, Dee cited as a ""precondition"" the  rebels' demand for the withdrawal of Executive Order (EO) No.  125, issued by President Ramos on 15 September 1993.    NDF peace representative Luis Jalandoni has said the order  threw ""a monkey wrench into the peace process"" and accused the  government of imposing the Philippine Constitution as framework  for the peace negotiations.    Jalandoni, in a statement issued in Utrecht, the Netherlands  in October threatened to pull out from the Vietnam talks if the  government did not recall the executive order.    Dee said the order ""defines the approach and administrative  structure for the government's comprehensive peace efforts  and...clothes the government panel with its authority to  negotiate peace settlement.""    He said it is the government's responsibility to follow the  ""Rule of law and Constitutional processes"" in pursuing a ""just  and comprehensive and lasting peace.""    Instead, Dee said, Jalandoni ""takes issue with the reference  in EO 125 and insists on resolving this issue even before the  holding of the exploratory talks in Vietnam.    ""Any disagreement on this issue should be elevated for  discussion ion the Vietnam exploratory talks as these talks are  intended precisely to reach common understanding for us to  proceed to the formal talks,"" he said.    Dee said that without the ""preconditions,"" the preliminary  meeting can take place to prepare the agenda and ground rules  for the exploratory talks.""    The former ambassador to the Vatican also urged Jalandoni to  ""come to the negotiations table to implement The Hague  Declaration so that together we may give peace a chance.""    ""Our people deserve nothing less.""     "

The NDF also insisted on the presence of exiled Communist  Party of the Philippines [CPP] founder Jose Ma. Sison during  talks with government. Although Fr. Luis Jalandoni is the NDF's  official representative, Sison -- who is believed to be the  current CPP chairman under the nom de guerre Armando Liwanag --  is recognized as a ""consultant"" of Jalandoni on the peace  process.    In a 22 January letter addressed to Ambassador Howard Dee,  chairman of the government panel dealing with the communist  rebels, Jalandoni stressed the need to ""adequately resolve  certain matters of principle and procedure. The NDF is willing  to resume exploratory talks,"" Jalandoni wrote. However, he said  government must first ""adhere to the Hague Declaration"" and  remove the obstacles to the peace process.    Members of the panel and its working groups confirmed the  contents of the document but refused to discuss it further, as  well as the courses of action the panel is considering. Dee in  27 December accepted the NDF's invitation for a preliminary  meeting in Europe before holding further exploratory talks in  Vietnam. But he said the NDF must drop ""their preconditions to  the exploratory talks.""    In response, Jalandoni wrote ""contrary to your allegations  that the NDF is making a precondition of EO [Executive Order]  125, it is Mr. Ramos who has thrown a monkey wrench into the  peace process by issuing EO 125."" He added ""any delay in the  NDF-GRP [Government of the Republic of the Philippines] talks is  ascribable to the Ramos regime's refusal to adhere to the letter  and spirit of the Hague Declaration, and setting up obstacles to  the peace process.""    Jalandoni said the executive order is ""a violation of the  Hague Declaration because it delimits the NDF-GRP talks to what  already appears in the existing GRP constitution."" But Dee had  said that EO 125 cannot be rescinded because the order ""in  effect creates the office of the peace process and also the  three panels (dealing with the country's rebel groups).""    In addition, a source in the panel explained that the EO  ""does not necessarily delimit the talks...it is an internal  document and the NDF is not covered by it.""    Jalandoni also denounced what he called ""the Ramos regime's  continuing total war policy."" But the source said the protest  was ""uncalled for,"" claiming the firefights between government  troops and communist guerrillas have been declining steadily.  ""Isa pa,"" [One more thing] he added, ""aren't they the ones who  had earlier stated that we should conduct talks first before  declaring a cease-fire, that any cessation of hostilities should  come after the talks and not before?""    Jalandoni also claimed government ""has been coddling (NDF)  renegades and expellees from the revolutionary movement."" He  said this, along with ""statements threatening to withdraw from  talks with the NDF and to hold peace talks with the renegades  and expellees,"" were all part of government's ""psy-war"" efforts.

General 'Uzi Dayan said: If the peace talks remain in crisis,  the Israeli military is braced for the contingency of war. Gen.  Amnon Shahaq said he did not foresee any change to the status of  the occupied Golan Heights this year. Uri Lubrani, the chief  Israeli negotiator with Lebanon, said those pressing for  implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 425 do not care  for peace.    Observers a re unanimous that the Washington talks are about  exploring ways to terminate Israeli occupation of Arab  territories and bring peace to the Middle East. They are agreed  that as long as Israel continues to balk at the requirement of a  complete withdrawal, peace will remain an impossibility. The  Arabs did not join the peace process or go to Washington to  appease Israel or indulge its wishes. They went to get their  occupied territories back and promote an enforcement of  pertinent Security Council resolutions. Syria wants the entire  Golan Heights back. Lebanon and Jordan also want to regain  sovereignty over their occupied territories, no matter how small  these may appear to be. Security Council Resolutions 242, 338,  and 425 -- the mainstays of any fair and universal settlement in  the Middle East -- require an immediate Israeli pullout from the  occupied Arab territory and an end to settlement activity. What  is the point of the Washington talks if they are not about  finding ways to implement these resolutions, remove the  occupation, and clear the path to peace? Does Israel really  think that the Arabs will define the shape of peace they want  before the Israelis make a public commitment to a complete  withdrawal as called for by UN resolutions?    Those who talk about peace being in crisis and raise the  specter of war are not interested in making peace. If the peace  is in crisis, this is thanks to Israel itself. It is thanks to  Israeli stubbornness that the two-year-old Washington talks have  hit an impasse. Had Israel proved receptive to a global  inclination for peace, Middle East peace would now be an  established fact. The Geneva al-Asad-Clinton summit has charted  the course of true peace and given added strength to  international efforts to that end.    If only Israel would end its intransigence and begin to act  as if is bound by Security Council resolutions instead of  creating obstacles and threatening a referendum on the Golan and  talking about a crisis that may erupt in war. The shortest  route to peace lies in the implementation of the underpinnings  of the peace process -- Security Council Resolutions 242, 338,  and 425, which are best summed up in the land-for-peace formula.  If Israel has trouble relinquishing its expansionist blueprints  and handing back the occupied Arab territories, how can it  realistically expect the Arabs to concede their land, rights,  and tradition, and bow to aggression, when they are impatient to  see peace established so that they can return to their land and  homes?    Syria has called for the peace of the brave. Israel must  realize that unless it displays a degree of courage commensurate  with the cause of peace, Middle East peace will remain an  unrealizable dream. However, belligerence and saber-rattling on  the one hand and courage on the other are strange bedfellows.  But if the Israelis reconcile themselves to hard facts and stop  showing racial hatreds and belligerent tendencies, they will be  truly courageous. All the world is waiting for the Israeli  rulers to adopt a positive stand in keeping with international  law and the sanctity of the cause of peace.     "

The sides focused on Russia's role in the Middle East peace  process and agreed that it must step up its peace activity in  the region. They also discussed bilateral relations between  Russia and Jordan.    Speaking at a news conference after his talks with the prime  minister, Posuvalyuk called for working on a parity basis in  order to ensure the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the Golan  Heights and restore peace between Israel and Syria.    He stressed that this is vital for reaching an overall  settlement in the Middle East.    The envoy emphasised the importance of the willingness of  the  sides involved to achieve progress in the peace process on the  basis of the principle ""full return of occupied territories in  exchange for peace."" He believes that the lack of progress or  failure of peace talks will play into the hands of forces  opposing restoration of stability and security in the region.

The talks will enter what the participants believe to be the most important stage of the three-strand talks process which started in April. Preliminary discussions took place yesterday to agree an agenda, establish ground rules and organise a manageable negotiating structure. The main talks will involve three days of meetings each week. They will be held initially at Stormont Castle in Belfast and will then move to Dublin, probably in the last week of this month. It will be the first time since the partition of Ireland in 1922 that Unionist political leaders have travelled on official business to Dublin. The talks are part of Strand Two of the three-strand process. The aim is an agreed formula for self-rule in Northern Ireland to replace the 1985 Anglo-Irish agreement. Strand One involved only political parties while Strand Two will include the Dublin government. Strand Three will involve discussions between the British and Irish governments. A month has been set aside for the current round of talks, which will be chaired by Sir Ninian Stephen, a former governor-general of Australia. Talks in July were seen as a preliminary phase, and the real negotiations are now expected to get under way. Signs of flexibility will be sought - for example, on whether the Irish government is prepared to relax or amend its constitutional claim to Northern Ireland, and on whether the unionist parties are prepared to concede a role for Dublin in an Ulster administration.

""The time for debate, clarification and for equivocation has  ended. Now it's time to sit down and make progress to end the  conflict in this country.""    Mr Spring said the Irish Government had been working for a  number of weeks to put forward a framework document about future  peace talks. ""We want everybody as part of the democratic  process. Both the Irish and British Governments have worked  very hard at bringing the paramilitaries on both sides away from  the violence. They have to make their decisions. The  governments want to move on and we hope that the other parties  will move with us. I would say to the Unionist and Nationalist  leaderships that there is an opportunity to establish peace on  this island now. That opportunity must be embraced by all  sides.""    He added: ""If Sinn Fein or others associated with violence  do  not grasp the opportunity that is there now, they are going to  be isolated and they are going to face a long time in isolation  if they are not part of the democratic process.""    Asked if he could see Unionists sitting around the same  table  as Sinn Fein, Mr Spring said: ""If the people in this country  have an interest in solving the problem, then they should all be  sitting at the table. Obviously, there are certain requirements  and a cessation of violence is one and that has to precede  anything that happens.""    Mr Spring was speaking to reporters in Londonderry as he  made  his way to County Donegal for the Euroelection campaign.     "

The paper notes that the Israeli position on the peace  process and its objectives is characterized by a disdain for the  peace process, avoidance of its objective -- comprehensive peace  -- and an attempt to replace it with the objective of partial  solutions.    The paper adds: In contrast, the Syrian position on the  peace process and its objective is characterized by concern for  the peace process and full accord with the Madrid formula and  the resolutions of international legitimacy. This position was  reaffirmed by President Hafiz al-Asad when he received the U.S.  secretary of state the day before yesterday.    AL-THAWRAH says: In light of the obvious contradiction  between the Syrian and Israeli positions, one important fact  emerges: The peace which Israel seeks to achieve is different  from that which the world and the Arabs want for the region.    The paper stresses: The kind of peace the world agrees upon  and for which the Arabs entered into talks in Madrid and  Washington is the kind of peace based on justice and  comprehensiveness and the kind of peace that returns to the  Arabs their rights and occupied territories in full.    Concluding its editorial, AL-THAWRAH says: Because the  Israeli position is still far from the foundations and  requirements of the peace process, the U.S. sponsor must build a  new direction for his efforts, based on providing all that is  necessary to force Israel to accept the requirements of the  peace process, on top of which is complete, unconditional  withdrawal.    On the same subject, AL-THAWRAH says: The outcome of  Christopher's talks in Israel has revealed the big gap between  Israeli and Syrian positions on peace because Israel is very far  from the foundations and requirements of the peace process,  which started in the Madrid conference.    The paper adds: Syria has stressed, and still stresses,  concern for the continuation of the peace process and a  commitment to continue to make efforts to push this process  forward. It has also responded, and still responds, positively  to U.S. efforts in that regard. Syria, at the same time,  adheres to the resolutions of legitimacy and the UN Security  Council which obliges Israel to withdraw completely to the 4  June 1967 borders as the condition without which the just and  comprehensive peace in the region cannot be attained.    Concluding its editorial, the paper stresses the need for  Washington's assuming the role of the unbiased, fair, and  effective partner by forcing Israel to submit to international  legitimacy and its resolutions.    Under the headline ""No Peace Without Land,"" AL-BA'TH says in  its editorial today that the U.S. initiative, which is based on  the land-for-peace formula, constituted the foundation on which  the Madrid Middle East peace conference was based. Resolutions  242 and 338 were considered the legal instruments that make the  Israeli occupation of the Arab territories null, rejected, and  impermissible, the paper says.    The paper notes that all those interested in world peace  have  acknowledged the importance of Syria's positive role in the  peace process since its acceptance to attend the Madrid  conference. They considered that acceptance to be the most  important in creating a new reality based on just and  comprehensive peace in the Middle East.    AL-BA'TH says: When the rounds of Washington bilateral talks  started, the Arabs felt that Israel was refusing to give  specific pledges to implement international legitimacy and that  its maneuvers constituted an extortion of the state sponsoring  the talks. With the start of every round of talks, Israel  wanted new weapons and fresh financial grants. Every round was  also preceded by a flagrant Israeli attack against Lebanon or a  massacre of the Palestinian people on their soil.    The paper stresses: From day one in the Madrid conference,  Israel knew that withdrawal from all of the Golan Heights is an  indispensable condition for establishing peace with Syria. It  must also be stressed that Israeli occupation of every inch of  the Arab territories must end on the basis of the initiative on  which the Madrid conference was based.    AL-BA'TH concludes by saying: If Israel is serious about  achieving peace, then the Arabs have responded favorably to  Madrid and Washington talks because they are advocates of peace  and because peace is their objective.

Sir Patrick Mayhew this week received a much warmer reception. Congressman Frank McCloskey, an Indiana Democrat, described Wednesday's meetings with Sir Patrick as 'very cordial'. Mr McCloskey, chairman of the Friends of Ireland in Congress, said: 'I was positively impressed.' The spectrum of opinion within the US on Northern Ireland has narrowed considerably. In the past the administration and the foreign affairs establishment in Congress tended to back the UK, while some members of Congress, mostly from New York and Massachusetts, were willing to overlook some of the means adopted by the IRA out of sympathy for the ends of the Irish nationalists. President Bill Clinton's nominally more interventionist Northern Ireland policy has been finessed since he took office into something much more palatable to the UK government. At the same time many members of Congress representing Irish-American constituencies are showing much less sympathy for the IRA than in the past, and are far less critical of UK policies. Both British and congressional officials credit the work of Mr Peter Brooke, the former Northern Ireland secretary, in starting peace talks. They also credit the 1989 Fair Employment Act, which went some way towards meeting US criticisms of job discrimination against Catholics in Northern Ireland - although some members such as Congressman Joseph Kennedy still have reservations. In addition, according to some congressional aides, the bomb that killed two children in Warrington earlier this year has further diminished the sympathy for the IRA. The practical result is that little concrete action is likely to be taken in the US this year on Northern Ireland. President Clinton has toned his promise to send a peace envoy down to a fact-finding mission, but the White House seems in no hurry to name its leader. At the same time the State Department has maintained its policy of refusing a visa to Mr Gerry Adams - president of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA - as someone who has engaged in terrorism, even though Mr Clinton last year said he favoured letting Mr Adams enter the US. Neither issue was raised at Sir Patrick's meeting on Wednesday with congressional leaders. While legislation has been reintroduced offering sanctions against breaches of the fair-employment principles of Mr Sean MacBride, the late Irish statesman, congressional experts say it is unlikely to move forward. Contributions to the multilateral International Fund for Ireland, however, are likely to pass more smoothly.

0,FT943-6021 ,"FT943-6021 _AN-EIAD1ABOFT 940901   FT  01 SEP 94 / The IRA Ceasefire: Markets show first flicker of positive response - Economy      By TIM COONE and WILL LEWIS      DUBLIN, BELFAST   The first flicker of a positive response by the markets to the IRA ceasefire came yesterday as several Northern Ireland companies made gains on the London Stock Exchange. The share prices of companies such as Northern Ireland Electricity and Ewart, the property developer, advanced by about 5 per cent to 6 per cent, against an overall FT-SE index gain of 1.7 per cent. It is obviously early days to assert that a trend is emerging from these gains, but they are indicative that business confidence in the province will grow if the ceasefire holds and that economic benefits for the province, and even for the republic, will flow from an end to the violence. Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, said yesterday: 'I have always believed there would be a huge peace dividend for the island of Ireland.' The first payments on that are expected to come from the US. Mr Reynolds talked by phone to US President Bill Clinton yesterday, following the IRA announcement, and said he believed US economic support for the peace process 'is going to be very important'. He added: 'President Clinton assured me today that he going straight away to work at an economic package to underpin the peace process in Northern Ireland.' Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, is to visit Washington shortly to follow this up. The US money will boost confidence, but of far greater importance will be decisions by the business community - both local and from overseas - on whether to boost investment in the province. An FT survey of business opinion in Northern Ireland in December last year revealed that more than half of the 56 leading companies surveyed believed that a political settlement, arising from an end to violence, would have a very positive effect on business and economic opportunities in Northern Ireland. A further 38 per cent believed that the effect would be 'fairly positive'. An additional benefit from an ending of the IRA bombing campaign will be a sharp reduction in compensation costs. The Northern Ireland Office currently pays between Pounds 30m and Pounds 50m a year to individual and corporate victims of the violence. The stationing of some 19,000 British troops in the province, and the maintenance of the RUC police force at a strength of around 12,000, imposes an even heavier burden on the Exchequer - thought to be in excess of Pounds 1bn per year. In addition, there is an Exchequer subsidy to Northern Ireland of a further Pounds 3bn. Economic development will reduce unemployment, raise the taxation base and allow a reduction in this subsidy, which if required could be recycled into investment projects. A joint statement by Mr Doug Riley, chairman of the Confederation of British Industry in Northern Ireland, and Mr Paddy Murphy, president of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said 'real economic benefits' would flow from 'peace and creation of a stable political framework based on agreed democratic principles'. Potential benefits included improved confidence leading to more investment and cross-border trade, the development of new products and 'a more expansive approach which could mean significant new employment opportunities'. Yesterday most small businesses along the Catholic Falls Road and the Protestant Shankill Road were sceptical about the effect of the IRA's statement on their businesses. Mrs Jan Cheevers, owner of Stevensons florists in the Shankill Road, said: 'If peace comes then it may help me, but I can't see that happening.' Her shop is next door to the fish shop bombed by the IRA last October. Nine people and the bomber died. 'There is no trust any more,' she said. Nearly all of her customers are Protestants. A newsagent in the Falls Road who did not wish to be named said: 'I suppose we may get some more tourists up here now, but really things are likely to go on much the same.' The manager of a taxi company based on the Falls Road said that the only benefit he would get was from increased aid from the US. 'If this leads to Clinton giving us more money then that obviously is good. But other than that business will probably go on as normal.'   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Last Sunday, Israel made several key demands of the United States as a  condition for acceptance of a five-point peace plan from Secretary of State  James A. Baker III. The plan is designed to get Israeli-Palestinian talks under  way.    ""I don't know what will be the proposals (from Baker),"" Shamir said in an  interview. ""Maybe he will accept all our proposals. And if there will be some  other proposals of the secretary, I think it will have to be considered by our  Cabinet.""    Shamir declined to specify which conditions he might be willing to give up --  his government also wants to narrow the scope of the talks to details for  holding Palestinian elections -- but the combative prime minister expressed  confidence that Washington ""will not bring the PLO to the negotiating table  against our will.""    This week's Bush-Shamir talks -- they will meet Wednesday at the White House --  have been the subject of strained diplomatic give-and-take. Bush withheld the  invitation on the grounds that he needed assurances bilateral talks would be  positive. In Israel, the delay was viewed as implied criticism of Shamir's  unwillingness to accept Baker's peace plan without conditions and a foretaste  of a rough ride in Washington.    Shamir himself declined to discuss the handling of the invitation. ""I'm not  ready to comment,"" he said tersely. The United States is itself negotiating  with the PLO, and those talks have become the main sore point between Jerusalem  and Washington. Shamir asserted that the Washington-PLO talks make it  impossible for Israel to find independent peace partners.    ""It doesn't help,"" Shamir said. ""I think that this dialogue strengthens the  PLO. It discourages people who have other views to be more outspoken to do  something for peace.""    Shamir bases his opposition to talks with the PLO on its demand for an  independent state. ""It's not a matter of a capricious mind,"" he said. ""The  reason is very simple. . . . If we would agree to talk to the PLO, it will  express our readiness to negotiate about a Palestinian state.""    Israel and the United States also disagree on the framework for a final peace  solution, Shamir added. Washington believes that Israel should give up at least  some of the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.    Shamir hopes the subject will not come up in Washington. ""I think these  differences are not relevant now because the advantage of the peace process is  to give the parties the possibility to negotiate in a gradual way about  advancing toward peace (while) having different views, different positions  about the ultimate goal,"" he said.    In a rare admission, Shamir said he does not think that the Israeli army can  fully repress the Arab uprising in the occupied lands.    ""We have some difficulties, of course, in handling this problem,"" Shamir said.

Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, will discuss in Dublin with Mr Dick Spring, Irish foreign minister, how unionist and nationalist political leaders can be persuaded to resume the negotiations which collapsed in November last year. Even before last week's local elections, which saw a better-than-expected performance by the hardline Democratic Unionist Party and Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, ministers from both governments were envisaging another Anglo-Irish conference before talks would resume. Now they may reconsider putting off the restart of talks still further. With the Reverend Ian Paisley, DUP leader, insisting his party will not return to talks until the Irish Republic compromises on its territorial claim to the north, the sense of political polarisation has increased. The moderate Ulster Unionist Party, led by Mr James Molyneaux, is also expected to be more cynical about talks. Sir Patrick has not commented on the local elections but the mood at the Northern Ireland Office at the weekend was that whatever the impact of the elections, there was no alternative to pressing ahead with restarting talks as originally hoped. It is also clear that Sir Patrick's personal initiative for restarting talks  -a paper being drawn up which will set out British government proposals for how Northern Ireland might be governed - will not provide an immediate catalyst to the resumption of negotiations. The proposals for a new devolved government in the province will not be presented to participants for some time. These suggestions may divide rather than unite them, by satisfying the demands of neither unionists nor nationalists. A crumb of comfort for Sir Patrick is the relatively good performance last week of the non-sectarian Alliance party in Northern Ireland.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

What is strange in these  statements is that Israel is speaking for the United States and  its officials in order to put pressure on Syria on behalf of the  United States. Has President Clinton's administration authorized  Israeli officials to speak for it about the peace process, or  are the Tel Aviv rulers trying to hint that time is moving  quickly and that Syria should catch the train of unilateral  deals to bring about peace before it misses both the train and  the fruits of these deals?    Speaking about Warren Christopher's time limits, Itamar  Rabinovich, Israeli ambassador in Washington and head of the  Israeli negotiating team with Syria, has warned that everyone  should know that the opportunity is limited. Ambassador  Rabinovich's statement is not the first nor the last of its  kind. Israeli officials make proposals every day that have  nothing to do with the bases of the peace process. Sometimes  they demand that the level of the talks be promoted and at other  times they declare that they want to know the nature of the  peace Syria will give to them or they allege Syria is not  serious in its talk about peace. In all cases, however, they  stress they will not withdraw from the Golan Heights, although  they have voiced their readiness to carry out some kind of  withdrawal from the Golan Heights--a withdrawal that will not  end the Israeli occupation or return the rights and the land to  their rightful owners.    Its threats that the opportunity is limited and that time is  short shows the true Israeli positions and the nature of  Israel's intentions. The Israeli officials, who have wasted a  great deal of time in futile talks over more than two and half  years, are trying to use the same weapon of time against Syria  to embarrass it in the international arena and portray it as the  side that is hampering the peace process. These officials are  mistaken if they believe that such attempts may succeed in  making Syria enter into the trap of unilateral deals, as they  succeeded with some sides, in order not to appear as an obstacle  on the way to peace.    These attempts will not affect Syria's known position and  cannot mislead the world public opinion, which knows the true  situation in the region, as well those who are placing obstacles  on the way to peace. Syria has always asserted that it is a  peace-loving state. The whole world, led by the U.S. and the  American sponsors of the peace process, also knows this fact.  Syria's desire to establish peace does not mean it will accept  unilateral deals or secret talks because of the time limit.  Such deals have weakened the momentum of the peace process and  lessened prospects of bringing about a just and comprehensive  peace that can stand fast in the face of changes and meet the  aspirations of the region's peoples and the world.    It is true that Syria wants peace, but it is also true that  it is not in a hurry. The peace that Syria seeks is based on  two principles: Justice and comprehensiveness in accordance  with relevant UN resolutions--a peace that can restore the land  and the rights regardless of time. What is important is the  achievement of that peace. Syria is not responsible for  hampering the peace march and wasting time. The whole world is  well aware of who is responsible for that. A desire for peace  can never mean embarking on the first train carrying that word.  First, we have to make sure that the train is on the right  railway. Otherwise, the peace train will not move, and even if  it moves, it will not reach its target.     "
0,FT931-14573 ,"FT931-14573 _AN-DARCMAA9FT 930118   FT  18 JAN 93 / Fresh talks on the future of Ulster expected      By ALISON SMITH and TIM COONE   THE FIRST Anglo-Irish conference since the Irish elections is expected to take place next month, and is likely to herald the initiation of fresh talks about the future of Northern Ireland shortly afterwards. British ministers expect that two meetings under the Anglo-Irish conference might be necessary to agree a way forward for the talks to start again, after their breakdown last November. There appears to be a consensus in London, Belfast and Dublin that the 'three-strand' approach of the last talks will not be repeated and that there is a need for a less rigid structure. This would allow a series of bilateral contacts between the two governments and the four main political parties in the province. One point on which the UK will be pressing is the prospect of change on the Irish constitutional claim over Northern Ireland. While not expecting the Irish to concede the claim instantly, British ministers are looking for a change of tone. When the negotiations broke down the Dublin government's statement that it only 'could', not 'would', hold a referendum on changing its constitution if an overall settlement were reached caused particular difficulties for the unionists. The new Irish government, which took office only last week, has not indicated its stance on this issue. Mr Dick Spring, the new Irish foreign minister, is expected to hold an informal meeting with Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, later this week to set dates for the first Anglo-Irish conference meetings.

0,FT942-6791 ,"FT942-6791 _AN-EE2AAAA3FT 940528   FT  28 MAY 94 / Differences emerge on Anglo-Irish blueprint      By DAVID OWEN   London and Dublin are at odds over whether the framework agreement they hope to complete for July's Anglo-Irish summit should contain an explicit commitment by Dublin to rescind its constitutional claim over Northern Ireland. Details of these differences emerged as Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, emphasised in a speech in Oxford that a settlement must win clear approval from the province's nationalists as well as its unionists. The two sides have made good progress on the document, which is designed to help forge a durable political settlement in the province by spurring political talks involving Ulster's main constitutional parties. But there are believed to be two potential sticking-points. The first concerns Dublin's move away from its claim on Ulster, and the other is over whether the agreement should set out a specific blueprint for Northern Ireland's future, as Dublin prefers, or simply provide a starting-point for new talks, as London wishes. Speaking just 24 hours after an informal meeting at Downing Street with Mr John Major, Mr Reynolds said that consent was needed by 'both traditions to a political framework that accommodates them both'. Just as Dublin had accepted that Irish unity could only come through consent, so unionists must accept that 'if Northern Ireland is for some time to come to remain under the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom . . . then they too must win the consent of northern nationalists to the democratic arrangements and structures under which this will happen'. He added: 'The total domination of one community by another is no longer acceptable as a basis for being governed.' Hinting that Dublin may adopt a tough stance in behind-the-scenes talks on the framework agreement, Mr Reynolds argued that the two governments' acceptance of the principle of consent had 'implications' for the 1920 Government of Ireland Act, as well as for Ireland's constitution. Though Dublin would support proposals for constitutional changes that 'fully reflect' the principle of consent in Northern Ireland, the Irish Supreme Court had already decided that the articles enshrining its territorial claim were 'fully compatible' with the country's obligation in international law. But Mr Reynolds combined his tough defence of the interests of northern nationalists with a strong condemnation of republican and loyalist violence. If violence continued, then Sinn Fein's quarrel would be 'not only with the British government but with the rest of the Irish people', he said. He called on unionists to tell loyalist paramilitaries that there was 'no valid excuse or justification for continued violence of any kind'.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

0,FT941-2967 ,"FT941-2967 _AN-ECRDQACAFT 940318   FT  18 MAR 94 / Adams sees prime peace role for US      By MICHAEL CASSELL, JUREK MARTIN, TIM COONE and DAVID OWEN   The US could play an instrumental role in helping achieve peace in Northern Ireland, Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, said in Belfast yesterday. His remarks, at a St Patrick's Day rally, came as Mr Bill Clinton, US president, said he had no regrets about letting Mr Adams into the US last month, in comments which received a cool response from Downing Street. Meanwhile, Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister on a visit to Washington, urged political leaders to 'show daring as never before' in order to make the Anglo-Irish peace initiative work. Speaking before yesterday's meeting between Mr Reynolds and Mr Clinton, Mr Adams said that the US administration was displaying readiness to take a fresh approach to the conflict in spite of sustained British pressure. The Sinn Fein leader said he detected a willingness among Irish Ameri-cans to try to move the US administration 'in the direction of directly contributing to the resolution of the conflict'. He said republicans wanted to live in peace and without coercion among their unionist neighbours. In Washington Mr Clinton called on 'all those who practice violence for political aims to lay down their arms' and urged 'those who have yet to do so to endorse the joint declaration as the best, indeed the only, way forward'. Mr Clinton responded to Mr Adams's remarks by saying he was 'quite encouraged' that the IRA remained interested in the peace process. Mr Adam's words came 'at a good time', and Mr Clinton added: 'I hope it has a good effect.' Standing with Mr Reynolds at a White House ceremony to mark St Patrick's Day, Mr Clinton said it was 'premature' to discuss the question of issuing another US visa to the Sinn Fein leader. He had no regrets about letting Mr Adams into the US last month - 'because we all have to take a chance for peace' - but indicated that much would depend on what Sinn Fein did next. Downing Street said last night that it disagreed with the decision to let Mr Adams in at the time but accepted 'they did it with the best of intentions'. Mr Reynolds said at a dinner hosted by the president that US support for the Ulster peace process would have 'an important influence on its outcome'. He sought to spell out the benefits of a peaceful settlement in the province, saying: 'We have painstakingly erected a framework for the peace process, a framework in which the joint peace declaration is a crucial element.'

Reports also say the U.S. secretary of state is  planning to visit the region next month in a fresh bid to  advance the peace process, especially on the Syrian and Lebanese  tracks.    The United States apparently attaches great importance to  the  current Washington talks, due to its firm conviction that peace  in the Middle East is impossible without Syria and that reaching  a Syrian-Israeli agreement will open all the doors of the region  to a just, comprehensive, and durable peace.    The Geneva summit between Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Bill  Clinton centered on the essence of Middle East peace. It  concluded that there is a need to establish a real and firm  peace accepted by the peoples of the region -- a peace that  reflects positively on their countries and that can withstand  successive developments. President al-Asad called such a peace  the peace of the brave, in accordance with which occupation will  end and Arab rights will be restored.    For its part, Syria has announced it will continue to seek a  just and comprehensive peace. Perhaps the best evidence of its  belief in peace, and in efforts to achieve it, is the talks it  is holding in Washington, despite public Israeli pronouncements  that reflect no change in the Israeli position, even after the  Geneva summit. The summit tossed the ball into the Israeli  court. It proved Syria really believes in peace and is  struggling to achieve a just, honorable solution accepted by  current generations and safeguarded by future generations --  peace that enables them to devote their resources to development  and progress.    We say this because Israeli officials, especially the head  of  the Israeli government, have recently cast doubt on Syria's  intentions and sought to undermine its role and status in the  region. They did not conceal their concern about the U.S.  shifting toward Syria because it is the key to peace in the  region. President Clinton and the U.S. secretary of state said  Syria is an extremely important country that has a pivotal role  to play in the peace process.    By casting such doubts, the Israelis seek to circumvent the  objective of a just and comprehensive peace in the region. Such  peace requires full Israeli withdrawal from the Golan, southern  Lebanon, and all occupied Arab territories, and the  implementation of Security Council resolutions to the letter.    It is no coincidence that the head of the Israeli government  has raised the idea of a referendum on the Golan, contrary to  all international resolutions, charters, and principles. The  Golan has been Syrian territory since time immemorial. There  can be no peace without its full return to the mother homeland.    Threatening to conduct a referendum is only a maneuver to  circumvent the objective of a just and comprehensive peace. It  is also an attempt to contain the U.S. position and conviction  that Syria is the key to the Middle East peace process.    The current Washington talks will be a decisive test to  Israel. The whole world expects a decisive shift by the Israeli  rulers toward peace and an end to the policy of maneuver and  procrastination that has so far prevented substantive progress  leading to genuine, comprehensive peace in the Middle East.

Document Type:FBIS TRENDS-02MAR94-SYRIA         Syria Scores PLO, Israel, Raises Questions on Talks        SUMMARY                              Syrian media reacted to the massacre in Hebron by intensifying  criticism of the Israel-PLO Declaration of Principles (DOP) and  the PLO itself and reviving more hostile anti-Israel rhetoric  reminiscent of the years preceding the current peace  negotiations.  At the same time, despite the Arab suspension of  bilateral peace talks with Israel and the use of Syrian media to  question the benefits of resuming them without further Israeli  concessions, Damascus has taken pains to signal its commitment to  the overall peace process.                           END SUMMARY      Syria's closely controlled media have portrayed the 25 February  massacre as a direct product of the DOP, implying that the event  serves to vindicate Syria's opposition to the agreement.  In this  context, the media have stepped up criticism of the PLO  leadership for signing both the DOP and a subsequent document on  its implementation, which was concluded in Cairo on 9 February.  A Damascus radio commentary declared that the ""massacre must be  directly or indirectly laid at the door of the Oslo and Cairo  agreements and whatever other pact may follow.""  It criticized  ""Palestinian negotiators"" for having ""forgotten Israel's crime-  ridden track record"" and being ""too trustful and unsuspecting,  thereby facilitating"" the killings in Hebron (26 February).  As  reported by Damascus radio the following day, an editorial in the  daily Al-Ba'th called the massacre ""the end result"" of ""the  flawed and lame agreement"" concluded between Israel and ""the  Palestinian negotiators.""     Moreover, in a revival of the volume and virulence of media  criticism of the PLO that followed the signing of the DOP in  September, Syrian media have given substantial coverage in the  wake of the massacre to anti-PLO statements by hardline Damascus-  based Palestinian groups.  For example:     --The official news agency SANA quoted Popular Front for the  Liberation of Palestine-General Command leader Ahmad Jibril as  implicitly threatening the lives of 'Arafat and other mainstream  PLO leaders (See Note 1).  Calling the massacre a ""fruit of the  Gaza-Jericho agreement,"" Jibril declared that ""the determination  of our Palestinian Arab people and Arab and Islamic nation will  punish those who conceded our sanctities, territories, and  history"" (27 February).     (Note 1) Jibril's threatening statement echoed his declaration on  30 September that ""'Arafat's fate will be no better than that of  French General Petain during World War II"" (Damascus radio).     --Damascus radio, reporting on a ""mammoth popular demonstration""  in the Palestinian camp al-Yarmuk organized by the hardline  factions, quoted Islamic Jihad Movement Secretary General Fathi  al-Shaqaqi as calling the massacre ""a continuation of the  liquidation plot embodied in the Gaza-Jericho accord"" (28  February).      Anti-Israel Vitriol      Syrian media have also reverted to the kind of virulent anti-  Israel rhetoric that was a staple of Syrian commentary in the  past but had been used with less regularity at least since the  start of the current peace process in October 1991.  Thus,  commentaries in the wake of the massacre have very frequently  favored the term ""Zionists"" and ""Tel Aviv rulers"" over ""Israel""  and ""the Israeli government.""  Claiming that the Hebron bloodbath  was simply the most recent of a long series of Israeli massacres-  -alleged to have included the 27 February church bombing in  Lebanon (for example, Damascus radio, 27 February)--the  commentaries have declared bluntly that the killings are  consistent with the nature of Zionism and demonstrate the  impossibility of Arab-Israeli ""coexistence.""  Several  commentaries in the daily Tishrin, as reported in same-day  broadcasts by Damascus radio, followed in this vein:     --On 26 February an editorial claimed that the Hebron massacre  ""proves the impossibility of coexistence between Arabs and  Israelis resulting from the fascist Zionist rancor against the  Arabs.""     --An editorial the following day declared that, through the  recent massacre, ""Zionism is addressing a message that it has not  changed . . . its racist and aggressive colors.""     --An editorial on the 28th claimed that ""Zionism and racism .  thrive on rivers of blood"" and referred to Israel as ""this racist  Nazi Zionist ghoul.""      Commitment to Peace Process, But ...      Nevertheless, Damascus has taken pains to emphasize commitment to  the peace process, while using the media to question the utility  of resuming the now-suspended talks in the absence of significant  concessions by Israel--a tack it has taken during previous  disruptions in the negotiations.  The Damascus radio announcement  of the suspension of bilateral peace talks in Washington by  Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan was quick to cite a Syrian spokesman  as having ""confirmed statements by U.S. officials that this step  does not mean an end to the whole peace process that began two  years ago"" (28 February).     Two subsequent media commentaries that referred to the suspension  of talks also took pains to convey that the suspension is  temporary and to stress that Syria remains committed to the peace  process.  Damascus radio, affirming that ""the Arabs are advocates  of true peace,"" declared that ""the suspension of talks will not  harm the peace talks, especially since only a few days are left  before the conclusion"" of the current session (1 March).  And the  daily Al-Ba'th on the same day followed up mention of the  suspension of talks by adding that the Arabs are not ""terminating  the peace efforts"" but are ""in effect telling the sponsors of the  peace process to wake up to their responsibilities"" (Damascus  radio).     At the same time, some editorial commentary has cast doubt on the  usefulness of negotiations under current conditions and called on  Washington to play a more vigorous role in pressing Israel for  concessions (See Note 2).  For example, Damascus radio declared  that ""talking about peace in light of the serious Zionist  escalation and Israel's continued refusal to withdraw from the  occupied territories or halt settlement activities is a waste of  time,"" adding that ""it is, indeed, absurd.""  The commentary  concluded that ""there is no purpose or meaning in holding any  peace talks that are not based on a clear Israeli commitment to  implement the UN Security Council resolutions and withdraw from  the occupied Arab territories"" (28 February).  As reported by the  radio, a subsequent editorial in Al-Thawrah asserted that  ""salvaging the peace process and the stalled peace talks requires  the application of all sorts of pressures on Israel to make it  honor the relevant international legitimacy resolutions and  conventions, respect human rights, dismantle settlements, disarm  settlers, and return to the Arabs all their territories and  rights"" (2 March).     (Note 2) Such expressions of doubt, and even the conditioning of  resuming the talks on Israeli concessions, have appeared  periodically in Syrian media commentary since the beginning of  the peace process.  For example, an editorial in Tishrin last  November declared that ""any resumption of the peace talks""--which  had not then convened since before the signing of the DOP--must  be preceded by a clear and public Israeli commitment to the peace  process and its principles, especially full withdrawal from the  Arab territories"" (Damascus radio, 20 November 1993).  Several  weeks later, however, Damascus announced its intention to return  to the peace talks, without any public commitment from Israel on  the issue of withdrawal (Damascus radio, 9 December 1993).      Implications      Although Damascus is probably hoping that the attack will scuttle  the DOP, Syrian media's anti-PLO attacks and shrill, hostile  rhetoric on Israel will likely subside, though not disappear, if  peace negotiations are brought back on track.  Moreover, in  raising claims that coexistence is impossible, Syrian media took  care to rule out coexistence not between Israel and the Arab  states but between ""Israelis and Arabs"" --presumably in the  occupied territories.  By such behavior, Syria has ensured that  the door remains open to the eventual resumption of the peace  talks.  (AUTHOR: BROWN.

The peace talks in Chiapas State will begin Monday at 1100.  The place is still unknown, obviously for security reasons.    Smiling and in good spirits, Manuel Camacho Solis,  commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas and San  Cristobal Bishop Samuel Ruiz said that we are quickly advancing  toward peace. Camacho Solis said that during the peace talks in  Chiapas the proposals presented by the EZLN [Zapatist National  Liberation Army] and the Indian groups will be honored because  the dialogue has political foundations. [sentence as heard]    [Begin Camacho Solis recording] We have agreed on the date  for the peace talks. Next Sunday, the movement of delegates  will begin. Bishop Samuel Ruiz and I will be traveling Sunday  morning to the various areas where there is an EZLN presence,  and will be accompanying the delegates to the city in Chiapas  State where talks for peace and reconciliation will begin the  following day at 1100.    We all want to begin real negotiations. The peace talks can  be one of two things: one, simply an opportunity to report  problems or present political programs; the other, an  opportunity to express views regarding the situation in Chiapas  and the country, and also to advance in negotiations that could  eventually lead to the end of hostilities, and hence to peace  and reconciliation. We must all choose between those two  options: Do we want this simply to be a forum to report  problems, or do we want to make this an opportunity to build  peace and reconciliation in Chiapas and in the country. I am  totally committed to the second option.    I have come here and will go to the forum to listen and to  learn. We have all learned a lot. We will also go to the talks  with the clear purpose of facilitating the end of hostilities.  In other words, the issue here is that we could not attain  peace if someone tried to force the EZLN into accepting a  solution that is not dignified. That is not the way to build  peace. The only possibility is respecting the proposals, listen  to them, discuss them, propose other things. The position I  will present will be the one I perceive as best for the  interests of the Mexican State, not of part of the  administration. It must reflect the various interests and  opinions, as well as the concerns, reports, and proposals that  the EZLN will present toward a possible political agreement that  can be built as time permits.    There are two options: either we simply meet to mention our  problems, or we meet to sign a peace agreement. I have  perceived that the EZLN, which at the beginning was probably not  ready for a change under the political conditions that prevailed  after 10 January, today has shown us through decisions like the  ones it adopted yesterday that it is interested in coming to the  negotiating table not only to present its political positions,  but also to open the possibility of a real dialogue that can  lead to dignified peace.

The Northern Ireland secretary had been criticised for singing on an Irish television chat show on Friday only hours after an IRA bomb killed seven civilians in Tyrone. The prime minister, speaking on a visit to Northern Ireland, expressed full confidence in Mr Brooke. But the incident appeared last night to have undermined efforts to start political talks on the future of the province. Amid bizarre scenes at Westminster, Mr Brooke won warm and almost unqualified support from Labour and Tory backbenchers for his honourable stance, but he is believed at Westminster to be unlikely to survive in his present post beyond the general election. He created confusion with his resignation offer, which he made public at the end of a Commons statement on the latest IRA bombing. Not until some hours later did Downing Street announce that it had been rejected. Mr Major described Mr Brooke as a 'very good friend of peace in Northern Ireland. . . He has more work to do yet.' Mr Major visited one of the workers injured in the blast during a Belfast tour and promised that the killers would be 'hunted, hunted, and hunted for the rest of their days'. Last night he and Mr Brooke spent two hours in talks with Unionist MPs on security in the province and agreed to consider some proposals, believed to include a citizens' militia and the cordoning of Catholic areas. Heading the Unionist delegation was the Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionist Party - the most prominent among those who called for Mr Brooke's resignation for appearing on the Late Late Show in Dublin. Mr Paisley did not rule out meeting Mr Brooke again, but said Unionists would 'consider very carefully' whether to take part in further 'talks about talks' on the future of the province. Mr Paisley said confidence in Mr Brooke had been 'irretrievably damaged', adding that the minister had, in effect, 'danced on the graves' of the IRA's victims. Among others, Mr Brooke is likely to have lost considerable respect for appearing to cower to DUP demands by offering his resignation. During the Irish television show, Mr Brooke expressed outrage at the attack and sympathy for the victims' families. He declined a request to sing 'Danny Boy', but bowed to the insistence of Mr Gay Byrne, the show's host, and sang 'Oh My Darling Clementine'. Northern Ireland Office officials had argued that to change his programme on Friday would have been to allow the IRA to set the agenda. In the Commons, Mr Brooke apologised for his 'error', which he insisted was 'innocent in intent'. As he spoke, Tory MPs shouted 'no, no, no'. Mr Kevin McNamara, Labour's Northern Ireland spokesman, praised Mr Brooke's 'characteristically honest and courageous statement'. Mr Brooke offered his resignation during Mr Major's trip to Belfast but urged the prime minister not to upset his itinerary to make a decision. Downing Street stressed that Mr Brooke had acted 'entirely honourably' and said the people of Northern Ireland would respect his stand, recognising 'the depth of his contrition'. In Dublin, Mr Gerry Collins, Irish foreign minister, backed Mr Brooke and looked forward to seeing him 'very shortly'. An Anglo-Irish conference meeting is expected next week. RTE, the Irish state television station, made a public apology to Mr Brooke. It said that: 'RTE would very much regret if the (interview) should damage in any way Mr Brooke's work or cause his resignation . . . it was an error to have invited Mr Brooke to sing and any offence which may have been caused is very much regretted'.

In three decades the two countries have been on the verge of deals a number of times only to see them founder on interpretation. The Anglo-Irish agreement, signed in November 1985, met intense unionist opposition. the then Mrs Margaret Thatcher, UK prime minister, entered into the agreement 'to defeat the men of violence and to bring peace and stability'. Dr Garret FitzGerald, her Irish counterpart, saw it as a way to end problems which the nationalist community felt had not been properly represented in the past. Moderate and hardline unionists believed the agreement betrayed their historic right to veto any deal by giving the Republic of Ireland a say in Northern Ireland affairs. Unionists had shown their muscle before when they rejected the Sunningdale power-sharing agreement in 1973. Hardliners interpreted it as a significant concession to the nationalist community. Renewed Westminster pledges over the next 12 years that Northern Ireland would remain in the UK so long as a majority in the province wished it were wrongly interpreted by unionists as a veto. The constitutional convention set up in 1975 by Mr Merlyn Rees, then secretary for Northern Ireland, was dismantled within months without being able to agree on any alternatives to direct rule. Efforts by Mr James Prior to set up an assembly foundered on the same rock. An attempt at forging a new understanding with the republic fell apart when Mrs Thatcher told parliament in 1982 there was no commitment to consult Dublin on matters relating to Northern Ireland. Yesterday's declaration depends on whether unionists interpret their right to stay in the UK as giving them a veto over the right of the majority in the UK - through the British prime minister - to make whatever agreement the government feels desirable.

The broad debate on Palestinian strategy, which also reflected desire for a revision in the framework of the Middle East peace process, came as Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, acknowledged for the first time that three Palestinian negotiators had threatened to resign. Mr Arafat said that after three days of talks within his Fatah faction, the PLO executive committee would now decide whether to accept the resignations offered by Mrs Hanan Ashrawi, Mr Faisal Husseini and Mr Saeb Erekat. The three negotiators are upset about a lack of consultation by Mr Arafat. As a concession to the three moderates, Palestinians are considering setting up a joint 'administration' linking PLO leaders with negotiators from the Israeli-occupied territories which would decide on a unified negotiating position. Such a move, if approved, would lessen Mr Arafat's grip on strategy, improve communication and strengthen the influence of negotiators from inside the occupied territories. A senior PLO official, however, said that the issue at the heart of the crisis was the framework for peace talks agreed in Madrid by all the parties in October 1991. He said it was recognised that after 21 months of fruitless talks the process contained two 'funda-mental flaws' - no direct talks between Israel and the PLO and a two-phased agreement which leaves resolution of the most sensitive issues, such as control over Israeli-occupied Arab east Jerusalem, until after an interim agreement on self-rule has been signed. 'The restrictions imposed by the Madrid framework has caused this latest tension and confusion because it makes divisions between the PLO and the negotiating team,' said the official. 'The framework no longer works and it must be changed if we are going to make quick progress on peace.' He also said Palestinians concurred that direct talks between Israel and the PLO, besides unifying leaders from inside and outside the territories, would help to accelerate peace talks. There is less consensus on the need to abandon talks on the interim phase of Palestinian self-rule and move directly on to talks about the 'final status' of a Palestinian entity. Both the US and Israel oppose any change in the Madrid framework until the possibilities of an interim agreement without direct talks with the PLO have been exhausted.

A final session of the six-week-old talks in Ivory Coast broke up without success last night and participants said negotiations were suspended indefinitely. 'I'm afraid the war is going to go on and probably to intensify,' Ms Margaret Anstee, the United Nations special envoy to Angola, said in the Ivorian capital Abidjan. 'That means we have to intensify our efforts to try to get the two sides together again.' There was no indication if talks between Unita and the MPLA government would restart. Ms Anstee said the main stumbling-block was a military clause in the draft peace agreement saying Unita fighters would withdraw from areas they have occupied since late last year. The MPLA said it was ready to sign the peace package, drawn up by observers from Portugal, Russia and the US. Unita refused. President Bill Clinton on Wednesday announced US recognition of the formerly-Marxist MPLA, effectively ending 18 years of support for Unita. In Angola, fighting continued.

Addressing backbenchers from the British and Irish parliaments at a meeting of the interparliamentary body in Dublin, Mr Reynolds said he remained hopeful that last December's joint declaration would produce results - but added that he was disappointed with progress to date. There had been 'little new evidence' that the two communities in the province were likely to reach agreement if 'left to themselves'. The two governments would have to play a role 'in encouraging, and maybe to some degree formulating an outline of an agreement between them', he said. The joint declaration made both governments 'effectively persuaders for an agreement'. Earlier this month Mr Reynolds revealed that the two governments had begun drafting a 'framework document' around which a future political settlement might be built. But in his clearest acknowledgement yet that the peace process has in effect stalled, Mr Reynolds cast doubt on whether Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, has the coherence and unity to deliver on its stated desire for a peace deal, and called for a more 'enlightened' leadership from the unionist parties. He added that both governments 'would be anxious and willing to break the present impasse' if Sinn Fein made clear what issues it still wanted clarified. His remarks came as Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, urged Sinn Fein to specify in what respects they believed the document to be unclear. The government had had to conclude that what 'clarification' really meant was 'renegotiation', Sir Patrick said. 'We are not getting into that,' he said. 'Nor are the Irish government.' Sir Patrick said that the declaration's non-partisan approach meant nobody needed to fear that their position would be 'ignored or excluded'. The ending of violence in Northern Ireland was 'a prize that threatens no one'. He added: 'It should relegate confrontation to the past.'   Countries:-  IEZ  Ireland, EC.

[Correspondent] Will it be possible to tell Angolans that  peace is still a distant dream or will we have pleasant news  over the next few days?    [Beye] I know very well that Angolans feel desperate and do  not want war. It is for that reason that we are in Lusaka. We  have scored successes because we have not negotiated in public.    [Correspondent] Do you not think that by giving more details  to the news media you would scale down the desperation of  Angolans?    [Beye] I do not think Angolans are completely desperate. We  have seen that in disputes as severe as the one in the Middle  East, the Oslo secret talks were successful. So, we would like  to adopt the same method in the Lusaka peace talks. I would  like to add that there are enemies of peace in Angola and  elsewhere. If the news media undermines the hope and morale of  the people, it would be serving the interests of the enemies of  peace. Now that we are closer to peace, the enemies of peace  are getting restless. They want to prevent us from achieving  peace. But we will achieve peace.    [Correspondent] You have said that because peace is closer,  the enemies of peace are at work. So, you are saying that peace  is closer.    [Beye] Precisely.

0,FT942-16583 ,"FT942-16583 _AN-EDJAAABBFT 940409   FT  09 APR 94 / Ceasefire followed by the sound of silence: Michael Cassell and Tim Coone review the effects of the IRA's gesture      By MICHAEL CASSELL and TIM COONE   The prospect was tantalising if unrealistic. All the British government had to do, according to Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, was to talk to republicans for one hour and the door to peace in Northern Ireland could open. This morning, with the IRA's three-day ceasefire over, the door remains stubbornly shut. The IRA's decision to call a post-Easter suspension of violence may have been unconditional and unprecedented - almost certainly arising more from pressure upon it to stop the killing than on any fundamental change of heart  -but it never looked good enough. Given some expectations, especially in Dublin, that the provisionals had planned a more dramatic, open-ended gesture aimed at ending the political stalemate, the 72-hour standstill impressed few people outside the republican movement. Why should anyone be grateful for what amounted to 'a suspended sentence of death', Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, asked yesterday. If the IRA and Sinn Fein were trying to drive a wedge between London and Dublin they will have been deeply disappointed by the two governments' show of unity. If they ever calculated that Mr John Major's own parlous position might force him into taking risks to win a triumphant peace they were wrong again. The Irish government called the respite from murder and intimidation 'pathetically brief' and its senior officials admit privately they expected something longer. The strength of reaction in Dublin is thought to have come as a surprise to republicans, who expected a more positive response after comments from Mr Dick Spring, Irish foreign minister, that he would seek to 'build upon' a temporary ceasefire. Having moved to accommodate Sinn Fein by dropping the broadcasting ban on the party and by providing, unlike London, extensive 'clarification' of the Downing Street declaration, Dublin feels let down. Throughout the ceasefire London continued to play a straight bat, repeatedly dismissing it as a 'cynical ploy' to extract concessions under threat of renewed violence. While the government chanted its peace mantra - 'no talks without a permanent end to violence' - unionists talked of IRA volunteers heading for the seaside to plan their next atrocities. Sinn Fein, still battling to extract clarification from London on the joint declaration but refusing to say what Britain could clarify that had not already been made clear by Dublin, hailed the IRA action as evidence of a flexible and open-minded republican movement anxious for peace. Republicans having taken the initiative, Mr Adams said, it was a case of 'over to you, Mr Major'. This week, however, the depth of Sinn Fein's anger at being marginalised in the political process - the price it is made to pay for its militaristic connections - became clear. Britain, insisted Mr Martin McGuinness, a leading Sinn Fein official, must stop treating it as a second-class political party instead of one speaking for those who were 'no longer prepared to be oppressed, humiliated, degraded and discriminated against'. To republicans, their war is an issue of pride and dignity as well as a matter of national boundaries. Sinn Fein has arguably been on firmer ground in citing the British government's previous, lengthy dialogue with republicans. Why, given the chance of a real breakthrough, is the government refusing to talk now, they inquire? Last year Sir Patrick won warm support from MPs for justifying contacts with republicans as an attempt to save lives. But in the wake of a joint declaration which enshrines the principles of majority consent, he now says there can be no truck with active terrorists. Efforts to bridge the gap between the two sides included unsuccessful calls for a go-between to relay Sinn Fein's specific concerns to the government. Hopes that the public rhetoric was concealing secret contacts seem, so far, unfounded, though suspicions linger that they will eventually be resumed. The failure to make any headway this week means further ceasefires will be tough to achieve. The position of those within Sinn Fein, such as Mr Adams, who helped bring it about could be weakened. The IRA knows that if it splits, it dies; it does not intend to split. As the province prepared itself uneasily for evidence that the ceasefire was over, Mr John Hume, leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party, called on the IRA to halt its armed struggle and help break down the barriers in the hearts and minds of the Irish people. The last 72 hours notwithstanding, it does not yet appear ready to heed the call.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.     IEZ  Ireland, EC.   Industries:-  P9721 International Affairs.

Yan said in a statement that this controversy should now be  closed and the peace process given greater momentum by the  spirit of understanding and accommodation. Yan said the  president's statement was never intended to preempt the ongoing  negotiation and that he [Misuari] should not impute sinister  designs to it.

[passage omitted]    It has been proven to the world that the concept of security  for the Palestinians in the occupied territories must be the  basis of negotiations if they are to succeed. It has also been  proven that settlements are time bombs and a source of threat to  any future peace agreement. Hence, the call to dismantle the  settlements and place the entire settlement issue on the talks'  agenda.    We say that it has been proven to the world that these facts  are known not only to the Palestinians but to anyone who has  even a superficial knowledge of the situation on the ground.  After this convincing evidence to the world and the U.S.  Administration's continued behavior as if nothing has happened,  the outcome is that the peace process cannot continue in its  present form.    If the PLO insists that the peace process in its present  form  has reached a dead end, and if Israel and the United States  insist on continuing the peace process, the logical conclusion  is that the peace process has practically ended.    Israel and the United States are trying to seek ways out,  but  plainly solutions are needed. What would have happened if the  PLO had an armed security presence in Gaza and Jericho when the  Hebron massacre occurred?    The thought of this or other scenarios, such as whether the  Palestinian security forces would have participated in the  protests, tried to control the protests, or refrained from doing  anything, can lead to destructive results. Settlements are not  only a huge obstacle to peace, but easily detonated land mines  planted between every inch of the same land on which peace must  prevail.    If the present situation continues, the end of the peace  process will have immense and grave repercussions not only among  Palestinians but also in the region as a whole. And if the  United States keeps exerting direct and indirect pressure on the  Palestinian leadership in a bid to renew the talks for the sake  of talks, the results of this pressure will have destructive  effects on the peace process.    The statement by President 'Arafat to NEWSWEEK to the effect  that the Palestinian people will not accept to continue the  talks in the form that existed before the massacre is best proof  that the crisis has gone beyond the stage of pressure. It is  inconceivable for anyone to expect the Palestinian leadership to  lose the support and backing of its people and also lose the  chance of making a genuine peace. The U.S. and Israeli  leaderships must examine for the fourth, fifth, and tenth time  the Palestinian demands presented to them on Friday morning, 25  February 1994.     "

Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, told the Dail (parliament) that there was a deep debate in the two organisations and that Ireland as a whole would welcome a response from republicans 'at the earliest possible time'. His remarks came ahead of tomorrow's meeting in Dublin of the first session of the Anglo-Irish intergovernmental conference since the two governments unveiled their joint peace initiative at the end of last year. The conference is likely to provide the opportunity for both governments to reaffirm their joint position on the peace initiative and to make clear that their demands for a cessation of violence remain a prerequisite to any progress on a settlement. Tomorrow will also see a Sinn Fein conference in Londonderry, called to give members another opportunity to express views on the peace proposals. The meeting will be addressed by Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president. With British ministers increasingly pessimistic about the prospects for a positive IRA response, Mr Reynolds continued to stress his optimism. He said: 'I am not privy to the internal debate that is going on. But there is clearly an intense debate. 'I have repeatedly made it clear since the declaration was signed that I did not expect an early response. We are trying to find a resolution to a centuries-old conflict. 'I am as hopeful as I was on the first day of the declaration. But time is needed, and there can be no artificial deadlines. We are trying to change direction, and take the gun out of Irish politics. I would still give it a fair chance of success.' He stressed that there had been no contact with Sinn Fein over the 'clarification' it had demanded before making a decision. Ulster police last night put the province on a firebomb alert amid fears that the IRA was about to strike against business and commercial property.   Countries:-  IEZ  Ireland, EC.

The economic implications of peace - if it lasts - would be complex. A recovery in Northern Ireland asset values and increased tourism in the Republic are among the possible outcomes. While there has been no rush to upgrade earnings forecasts, though, the ceasefire has certainly been good for sentiment and helped focus the attention of international investors on favourable fundamentals. While the Irish economy was stronger than most of its European peers through the recession, growth was driven by multinationals using Ireland as a base for exports. Yesterday's results from CRH, the building materials company, show that domestic demand is now starting to take over. Against that background the market looks cheap on a multiple of around 12 times this year's forecast earnings - even allowing for the large proportion of lowly-rated financial stocks in the market's capitalisation. The lingering doubt is that a market driven higher by international capital flows must also be vulnerable to a sudden change of sentiment. A further appreciation of the Irish punt - perhaps beyond parity with sterling - would raise fears about competitiveness. Still, if peace in Northern Ireland gives international investors one less reason to take fright, the market's latest gains should be sustainable.   Countries:-  IEZ  Ireland, EC.

The crushing defeat of the Tories at the Christchurch by-election on Thursday, leaving them with a majority of just 17, and continuing threats of rebellion on the Tory backbenches have given Mr James Molyneaux, the UUP leader, the opportunity he has long been looking for. He now hopes to drive a wedge between London and Dublin and to reverse what Unionists perceive to be the growing influence of the Republic of Ireland in Northern Ireland's affairs. In return for the support of his nine MPs, Mr Molyneaux said last week that he had reached an 'understanding' with Mr Major. The government has repeatedly denied that a deal was struck. Mr Ken Maginnis, the UUP deputy leader, said 'there has not been any last-minute deal signed up in legal terms'. Talks had being going on for months 'resulting from government frustration with the Northern Ireland round-table talks process and the intransigence of the Irish government and the (nationalist) SDLP'. He added: 'The government has for some time been indicating a willingness, if all else fails, to consider changes in the way Northern Ireland is to be governed.' Some of the changes envisaged by the UUP include the establishment of a Northern Ireland select committee at Westminster, the broadening of local government powers in the province and 'greater attention being paid to persons with experience in security issues'. Asked whether these changes would signify the abandonment of the Anglo-Irish Agreement Mr Maginnis said: 'I certainly hope so.' Mr Molyneaux said last week he expects the agreement 'to wither away'. This has set alarm bells jangling in Dublin. Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, said last week he would be 'very concerned' by any unilateral moves made by the British government on Northern Ireland. One of his aides said: 'If a clear warning is made to London that any unilateral move would be viewed as undermining the Anglo-Irish Agreement, but they go ahead and do it anyway, then one can only conclude that this would lead to a major crisis in Anglo-Irish relations'. The fact that Mr Reynolds has stepped into the fray, not leaving it solely to Mr Dick Spring, his foreign minister, is indicative of the seriousness with which the issue is being dealt with in Dublin. In Belfast the SDLP, led by Mr John Hume, said: 'This is an integrationist move, making Northern Ireland similar to Scotland or Wales and ignores the fact that we have a divided community here, where a large part of the population consider themselves Irish.' Hitherto, the British government has professed neutrality in the Anglo-Irish talks process. A key phrase used by Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, and first coined by Mr Peter Brooke, his predecessor, was that Britain had 'no strategic interest' in Northern Ireland - a phrase which alarmed Unionists but encouraged nationalists to believe that Downing Street was genuinely exploring a neutral approach. Mr Hume has been involved in bilateral talks with Mr Gerry Adams, the leader of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA. The talks have angered Unionists but Mr Hume says they are aimed at bringing the political violence to an end. Unionists accuse Mr Hume, Sinn Fein and Dublin of trying to set up a 'pan-nationalist front'. Although there has been discomfiture in Dublin at Mr Hume's move, the official government reaction is that 'Mr Hume is an experienced politician and knows what he is doing'. According to those close to the Hume-Adams talks, one of Mr Hume's main arguments has been that the British government's professed neutrality in the round-table talks and its statement of 'no strategic interest' in the province, provide the basis for a negotiated end to the political violence. Significantly, Sinn Fein has substantially moderated its tone over recent months, and although it still argues that Britain must go one step further and make a commitment to militarily and politically disengage from Northern Ireland, it sets no deadline for this as it has in the past and has been making increasingly conciliatory statements directed towards the Unionists. Mr Hume's key argument now looks very shaky however, and with it his hopes of ending the IRA bombing campaign and eventually bringing Sinn Fein into the peace process. In private, the republic's officials now talk about playing the US card  - asking the Clinton administration to appoint a 'peace envoy' to Northern Ireland. British objections have until now restrained Dublin from pushing this option. A further option might be for the republic to ease its 22-year broadcasting ban on Sinn Fein. This would increase pressure for a review of the similar ban in the UK.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P9199 General Government, NEC.   Types:-  GOVT  Government News.

0,FT944-10079 ,"FT944-10079 _AN-EKMASABOFT 941112   FT  12 NOV 94 / Reynolds skulks in the wings: The Newry murder has made the Irish premier reticent      By JOHN MURRAY BROWN and DAVID OWEN   The usually firm hand of Mr Albert Reynolds, prime minister of the Irish republic, was notably absent yesterday as his government awaited assurances from Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, after Thursday's murder of a post office worker across the border in Newry. Few commentators in Dublin can remember a time in the 10 weeks since the IRA ceasefire in which the Irish premier has been quite so reticent about taking centre stage on a policy which he has orchestrated almost single-handedly from the Irish side. After his government's decision to rescind its programme of IRA prisoner releases, it was left to the hapless justice minister, Mrs Maire Geoghegan-Quinn, normally a sure-footed performer, to explain the about-turn. The Dublin government has often warned of the dangers of leaving large numbers of republicans behind bars once a ceasefire was in place. It argued a goodwill gesture was needed to bolster the moderate voice in the IRA. Mrs Geoghegan-Quinn was adamant that at no time did the government plan the release of more than nine prisoners, in spite of newspaper reports in the republic that as many as 30 convicted terrorists were being considered. Her government colleagues were yesterday quick to applaud her robust defence of the policy reversal. Only Sinn Fein expressed outright disappointment. Another surprise was the absence of any murmur of discontent from civil liberties groups. Some politicians, however, privately wondered about the consistency - having offered to release the prisoners - of withdrawing the concession because of an event 60 miles away in another state. Not only the release programme has been put on hold. Dublin is reviewing its whole approach to the peace process. Where days ago a cross-party consensus had prevailed in the republic in support of Mr Reynolds' efforts, the opposition yesterday seemed to have a renewed bounce in its step. Both governments insist the peace process is on track. Mr Dick Spring, the republic's foreign minister, and Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, are due to meet in Dublin on Monday about progress on the framework document. The Northern Ireland Office said yesterday that nothing had changed its 'working assumption' that the IRA had ceased its military operations. Exploratory talks with Sinn Fein about the 'practical consequences' of the ceasefire may start this year. They would cover the decommissioning of arms and explosives, and the steps required to return Sinn Fein to democratic politics and the bilateral talks. But the Newry murder and Sinn Fein's less than frank explanation underline the danger of taking its assurances on the permanence of the ceasefire at face value without first verifying the disposal of arms and explosives. 'It will certainly make us more cautious,' said a UK government official. The Newry tragedy has underscored British concerns that the issue of arms and explosives must be addressed before full political negotiations can begin, in spite of the insistence of Mr Martin McGuinness, Sinn Fein vice-president, that the issue is 'down the road'. The main outstanding question is whether the Newry attack was carried out by a renegade republican unit or whether it was in some way at the behest of the IRA's central command. If the former, then there seems no reason why London should not begin discussing the handing in of arms with republican leaders before the end of the year, as previously envisaged. Indeed, the incident might even play a part in helping to convince the leadership of Sinn Fein that it has something to gain from the surrender of at least some IRA weaponry at a relatively early stage in the peace process. But if the raid was sanctioned by IRA leaders, then the UK government's so-called working assumption that the IRA ceasefire was permanent would be under severe pressure. It is hard to see under those circumstances how a severe delay in preliminary dialogue between London and republican leaders could be avoided. Thursday's attack also underlines the importance of efforts being made by senior British and Irish officials to develop a co-ordinated approach to dismantling paramilitary arsenals, as agreed at Chequers last month. Mr John Major, UK prime minister, said the discussions would concentrate on the 'logistics and mechanics' of arranging for weapons held by paramilitaries to be handed over. It is almost certain that these discussions will have continued at yesterday's meeting of the liaison committee of British and Irish officials in Dublin. Sir Patrick and Mr Spring will be under pressure to say more on Monday about the substance of the committee's deliberations.   Countries:-  IEZ  Ireland, EC.     GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

The raids by Gardai officers in four counties near the Ulster border resulted in the seizure of guns, ammunition, hand grenades and detonators belonging to a previously unknown group called the Irish National Republican Army. The operation, coming as it did on the eve of yesterday's meeting at Chequers between Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, and Mr John Major, his UK counterpart, will underscore the Irish desire to accelerate the peace process and harness Sinn Fein and the broader republican movement to the peace process. The operation follows a meeting between Mr Reynolds and Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein leader, last Thursday. A Gardai statement said the raids were directed against 'breakaway factions such as Republican Sinn Fein and the Irish National Republican Army' which were involved in 'criminal and subversive activity'. Republican Sinn Fein is a splinter group established after a break with Sinn Fein in 1986, when Mr Adams abandoned the movement's policy of boycotting elections in the republic in a bid to raise local support. The RSF, with the more extremist IRA offshoot, the Irish National Liberation Army, has refused to endorse the August 31 decision to call a ceasefire. The weekend finds came as the Gardai reportedly withdrew border checkpoints at four locations in the Sligo Leitrim area in the wake of improvements in the security situation. In a related development British troops have reportedly reduced their presence in both Londonderry and Tyrone, two nationalist areas in the north. For the first time in more than 20 years a number of border crossings were reportedly unmanned at the weekend, a development which one unionist councillor yesterday condemned as a concession to the IRA.

But Dublin's attempts to uphold parts of the nationalist agenda leave substantial obstacles. The Irish government's six-point plan says: 'The people living in Ireland, north and south, without coercion, without violence, should be free to determine their own future.' But confusion has arisen over how this fits with Mr Spring's statement last week that Dublin accepts the principle of a unionist veto over constitutional change in the north. The Irish foreign ministry said that 'majority consent' and 'unionist consent' should be considered together. Another question arises over the means by which the Irish may satisfy unionist demands over their claim to sovereignty of the north. The Irish constitution can only be amended by referendum. Dublin's objective, admitted by the government, is that any new agreement on governing structures should be approved by a referendum in the north, while a simultaneous referendum in the Republic would both amend the Irish constitution and approve the agreement reached in the north. Simultaneous referenda are a key element in the Hume-Adams peace initiative, and acceptance of them is thought to be the signal Sinn Fein is looking for as the minimum condition for the IRA ending its violence.

Mr Bruce Morrison, a former US congressman, said after an hour-long meeting in Dublin with the Irish prime minister and foreign minister that the objective of his visit to Dublin and Belfast was to help achieve 'an end to violence through a broad-based political process'. Mr Morrison said: 'All political leaders should grasp the straws, whatever they are, which lead towards peace . . . and try to take the steps which will turn it into a permanent cessation.' The Irish Foreign Ministry said the US delegation was briefed on the Irish government's view of the peace process. It was stressed that the government sought 'a total cessation of violence'. Mr Morrison, considered a close friend of Mr Bill Clinton, the US president, confirmed yesterday that he would report to the White House on his return to the US. In Belfast yesterday a senior figure in Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, said that an 'unprecedented opportunity to get down to the nuts and bolts' of the conflict lay ahead, which he hoped would lead to 'multi-party dialogue'.

In an interview with THE SUNDAY TELEGRAPH, two leading  members of the outlawed organisation, which carries out  sectarian murders against Catholics in Northern Ireland under  the the title of Ulster Freedom Fighters, also warned that it  will continue its activities even if the IRA eventually calls a  permanent ceasefire.    The warning, in the wake of the IRA's refusal to extend its  three-day ceasefire of last week, will deal a further heavy blow  to John Major's peace initiative. The IRA resumed its campaign  early yesterday morning shortly after the ceasefire ended, when  shots were fired at two army checkpoints near Newtownbutler,  County Fermanagh.    The two UDA leaders, who described themselves as the heads  of  the UDA's southeast Antrim and south Belfast battalions, also  confirmed that the UDA has drawn up contingency plans in the  event of civil war in Northern Ireland, which they believe is  moving closer, and called for clarification of the Downing  Street declaration.    In what appeared to be a direct threat to members of the  Irish Government, one of the men said: ""There's a price to pay.  They haven't paid it yet...all their dues are being recorded  and they'll have to pay up.""    The Republic, they said, must abandon its constitutional  claims on Northern Ireland, and what they see as ""one  geographical state thinking"" aimed at removing Northern Ireland  from the United Kingdom and bringing about a united Ireland.    They described the Irish Government as part of a  ""pan-nationalist front"" that includes the IRA, Sinn Fein and the  SDLP [Social Democratic Labour Party]. The UDA's campaign would  therefore continue, they said, since in the event of an IRA  ceasefire the constitutional claim would remain.    One of them confirmed that the UDA would continue its  activities even were the IRA to lay down its weapons  permanently: ""There must be a prize for the IRA to call a  ceasefire. The reasons for it would have to be closely looked  at. Our days of reacting to the IRA are over as far as we are  concerned. Our agenda now is pro-active.""    The other man said: ""We see a grim future. I think civil  war gets nearer by the month, and that's not warmongering,  that's a fact.""    Anyone who believed that Unionists would allow themselves to  be drawn into a united Ireland was ""making a big  miscalculation,"" he said.    ""The feeling in our community now is that violence pays.  Morale has worsened since the declaration was signed. The only  people that we can trust are ourselves.""    The UDA leaders said that the joint declaration by the  British and Irish Government ""means nothing to us."" However,  they added that clarification would be welcome: ""The IRA want  to know ,what comes next. We would like to know that too.""    The two men said the UDA is stepping up its political  profile. A working party is drawing up a paper based on two  previous publications, Beyond the Religious Divide and Common  Sense, which favour power-sharing in Northern Ireland, and a  bill of rights. ""It aims to fuse the two together, and we  expect to publish it in about two months.""    They indicated that the UDA may propose an independent  Northern Ireland, which would have links with Britain and the  Republic within an expanding EC.

Sir Patrick invited the leaders of the four main constitutional parties to meet him for separate talks over the next two weeks to discuss ways of getting the inter-party discussions going again. But the Democratic Unionist party leader told the Northern Ireland Office he was not interested in discussion until the Irish Republic removed its territorial claim over Ulster. He also said he would not talk until Mr John Hume, leader of the nationalist SDLP, ended discussions with Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein. Rev Paisley said he had told the Northern Ireland Office he wanted Sir Patrick 'to tell us why he wants to see us, what documents he is going to place before us and then we would consider what we would do'. Mr Hume is to meet Sir Patrick tomorrow and the Ulster Unionist party has indicated Mr James Molyneaux, the party leader, will meet him next week.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

0,FT934-12592 ,"FT934-12592 _AN-DJZDHADYFT 931026   FT  26 OCT 93 / No need to talk to IRA      By JOE ROGALY   It can go on like this. The campaign of violence generated by the provisional wing of the IRA nearly a quarter of a century ago may continue for as long again. Sir Pat-rick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, said in the Commons on Friday that the price of defending democracy and the rule of law is always high, and always worth paying. 'We shall defend them in Northern Ireland, if necessary at infinite length,' he insisted. The thought is almost too awful to contemplate, particularly as we weep for the innocent victims of the Saturday night bombing in the Shankill Road. Surely something can be done? Not much. Formulas for immediate peace depend on one of two unlikely starting points. First, the IRA provisionals could unilaterally renounce violence. The events of the past few days demonstrate their unreadiness to do so. Alternatively, the British government could offer concessions and negotiations in return for an undertaking to end the carnage. As Sir Patrick intimated again yesterday, there is no question of such a deal. The courageous Mr John Hume, the Social Democratic and Labour party member for Foyle, will not accept this impasse. He is to be given credit for his motives, even if his hard work does not produce a successful result. He has been talking to Mr Gerry Adams, the leader of the political wing of the IRA. They appear to have been working on a delicate formula. Perhaps we should see the full details before we judge it, but rejection is the likely outcome. Any peace plan that involves formal negotiations with Mr Adams or Sinn Fein ahead of a complete and unequivocal renunciation of the use of terrorism as a political weapon will fail. Some will protest that this is too inflexible a posture, that the situation is so horrible that it requires an abandonment of previously entrenched positions. The recent South African and Middle East breakthroughs are seductive examples in support of such an argument. The case does not, however, stand up to examination. It is true that President F W de Klerk released Mr Nelson Mandela from prison and negotiated with him, even though the ANC leader refused to disband his raggle-taggle and pathetically ineffective army. But the IRA cannot rely on this analogy. Irish republicans have the vote, both north and south. Mr Adams even won an election to the Westminster Parliament. South Africa's blacks could not vote. They have not yet done so. Again, the Israeli government has recognised and dealt with the Palestine Liberation Organisation, after years of swearing that it would not. But its overriding objective is survival. It has always seen its first duty as the defence of Israel's existence against a host of external enemies. At the time of the recent deal it had nowhere else to go. Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO leader, was likewise in a corner. The other Arab states were not able to represent the Palestinian interest in direct talks with Jerusalem. Here it is different. Britain is not, and will not be, threatened with obliteration by the IRA provisionals. No external enemies surround us. Sir Patrick looks to constitutional talks to further the peace process. The Anglo-Irish agreement provides for direct conversations between London, Belfast and Dublin; he will pursue those. Principles apart, there is no need to deal with the provos. Think about it. There is no domestic political reason why the government should conclude a peace agreement with Sinn Fein, let alone with its terrorist counterpart. You might think that after 24 years of violent insurrection there would be a swelling chorus in favour of compromise, of doing a deal, of getting out, of ceasing hostilities at any price. There is not. I recall a recent conversation with a senior minister. Our starting point was the catalogue of IRA and 'loyalist' violence. Since 1969, no fewer than 3,089 people have been killed by terrorists in Northern Ireland alone. Some 2,156 of these were civilians. These figures include an increasing number of murders by 'loyalist' paramilitary organisations. Murders on the British mainland are becoming commonplace. To remind you of just two - in Warrington in March an IRA bomb killed a three-year-old and a 12-year-old. This was part of a seemingly never-ending series of bombing campaigns, some pre-Christmas, some for Christmas, some aimed at 'economic targets'. The City of London has been sealed off since the summer; only yesterday travellers inwards from the west were inconvenienced by bombs at Reading and Basingstoke. Mr Tony Benn, relying on the House of Commons research department, said on Friday that the total cost of the emergency since 1969 was Pounds 14.5bn at current prices. The senior minister pointed out that this unhappy story carries a strange moral, namely that there has been no public demand for a change of government policy. Mr Benn quoted opinion polls that suggest the opposite, but these were even less convincing than usual. The postbags of members of parliament are not stuffed with constituents' letters pleading for a deal with the IRA. The troops-out movement appears to have faded away; yesterday Labour was calling on the government to send more soldiers in. The British people are almost absurdly stoical. They express horror at every new outrage. They condemn, but offer no quarter to, the perpetrators. Each additional inconvenience to the travelling or working public is bitterly criticised, but rarely adduced as a reason for changing tack. In sum, the political tide is against Mr Hume's plan. Mr John Major, who does not enjoy a reputation for firmness, would be greatly damaged were he to 'give in to the IRA'. That would be seen by the voters as losing a war, something alien to the British psyche. The prime minister is aware of this. He said at the recent Tory conference that 'no government which I lead will negotiate with those who perpetrate or . . . support the use of violence'. The Tories have restored their former name - the Conservative and Unionist party - in recognition of the reality that Mr Major's government, which commands a majority of just 17 with Conservatives alone, frequently has to importune nine Ulster Unionists for support. Heaven knows what has been promised in return, but we can be sure that a deal with the provos before they lay down their arms is not part of it.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Prison Officers' Association officials in the province said yesterday that 80 per cent of those members balloted supported some form of action. The POA committee for Northern Ireland is due to meet today to discuss what form the action should take, but it is not expected to involve a strike. Any action will hit the Maze, Crumlin Road, Magilligan, and Maghaberry prisons as well as a young offenders' centre in Belfast. The Northern Ireland Office said overcrowding claims were exaggerated but POA officials said the situation in the province had become intolerable. Some prisoners were having to share two to a cell, and in some cases there were three to a cell, it said. Speculation that US president Bill Clinton may send a peace envoy to the province was renewed yesterday. The new US ambassador to Ireland, Mrs Jean Kennedy Smith, presented her credentials to Irish President Mary Robinson in Dublin and said she planned to visit Northern Ireland.

The encounter will precede the group's meeting in Belfast tomorrow with Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA. The delegation is headed by Mr Bruce Morrison, a former congressman who is considered a close friend of Mr Bill Clinton, the US president. Although not on official US business, Mr Morrison is expected to impress upon Mr Adams the desire of prominent Irish-Americans to see an IRA ceasefire in return for the lobbying that has been done on behalf of nationalists in the US, and which resulted in Mr Adams obtaining a temporary entry visa to the US earlier this year. Mr Adams has said he considers his meeting with Mr Morrison's group important. However, the Irish government yesterday played down the significance of Mr Reynolds' planned meeting with the delegation. The group is also to meet leaders of the mainly nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party and the Alliance party in Northern Ireland, but last-minute requests to meet unionist leaders were turned down by both the Ulster Unionist party and the hardline Democratic Unionist party. In a sign of growing tensions within the SDLP over the peace process, Mr Joe Hendron, the party's MP for West Belfast, said he sympathised with the unionists for not meeting the US delegation because 'they have identified fairly strongly with the nationalist side'. With an IRA ceasefire widely expected to be announced within two weeks, new rifts are also appearing in the unionist camp. Mr David Irvine, a member of the Progressive Unionist party, which is thought to reflect the views of loyalist paramilitaries, yesterday accused the Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the DUP, of attempting to destroy efforts to bring the UUP and DUP closer. He said there was 'widespread anger' among loyalists at recent attacks by Dr Paisley on the UUP. 'Unionists should be working together to face the future from a position of strength, but he is ensuring division,' he said.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.     IEZ  Ireland, EC.

Under the deal, Washington's annual contribution to the International Fund for Ireland is to increase, subject to congressional approval, from Dollars 20m (Pounds 12.2m) in 1995-96 to Dollars 30m for each of the following two years. The increases will take the total commitment of the Clinton administration to the fund to Dollars 100m. Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, said: 'I am delighted that Northern Ireland is still at the top of the agenda of the American president.' Mr John Hume, leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party, said: 'This is a very welcome announcement by Mr Clinton and confirms the undertakings which he previously gave to help build on the peace. I deeply appreciate the involvement which the president has shown and I am very aware of his willingness to assist us economically.' In addition President Clinton has said he will personally host an international trade and investment conference on Ireland next April in Philadelphia. It was also announced that Mr Ron Brown, US commerce secretary, will be in Belfast for the investment conference organised by the UK government in December. Mr Brown will go on to Dublin for talks. Forty US companies are already operating in Northern Ireland providing 9,000 jobs. The International Fund for Ireland, set up in 1986 by the US and the European Union, last year stood at Pounds 225m. The body provides venture capital for small and medium sized businesses in the province's most depressed areas. Last year it helped create more than 2,600 jobs. There was a more guarded welcome for the package from the Ulster Unionist party. Mr James Wilson, the party's general secretary, said: 'Financial aid is always welcome provided it is fairly distributed in the province and provided it is directed to areas of real need and in support of real jobs.'

General Mya, what would you like to say  about this?    [Mya] Our view is that we will not be able to achieve  internal peace through a cease-fire agreement with the SLORC.  The SLORC's cease-fire is a sham. The revolutionary forces in  Burma took up arms for political reasons; the SLORC is pursuing  a cease-fire, but this does not solve the political problem.  Internal peace can only be established when the political and  ethnic problems are solved. The SLORC is not doing this. It is  pursuing a cease-fire, but it is not talking about politics.  When political issues are raised, it insists categorically on  the surrender of arms. The KNU [Karen National Union] cannot  accept this.    Other ethnic groups made cease-fire agreements with the  SLORC  and held talks, but they were not allowed to raise political  questions; they stopped at the cease-fire issue. This does not  serve the interests of the ethnic groups' armed revolutionary  struggle. Furthermore, the SLORC does not wish to establish  internal peace; we have learned that it is pursuing this in  order to get foreign loans.    [Correspondent] The news on the outside is that the SLORC  and  Gen. Mya's KNU are attempting to hold cease-fire talks.  Considering the points you just mentioned, what reason would  you have for holding cease-fire talks?    [Mya] We will not discuss a cease-fire with the SLORC. We  will participate, however, if talks are held. If we participate  we will do so according to DAB [Democratic Alliance of Burma]  policy; if we hold talks we will do so as the entire DAB. We  informed the SLORC, but it did not accept this. It said it will  only hold separate talks. We said we would hold separate talks,  but they had to be held abroad in accordance with DAB policy.  The SLORC did not accept this; it wanted to hold the talks in  Rangoon.    We insisted on holding talks abroad because we held talks  with the BSPP [Burma Socialist Program Party] on three previous  occasions without any success. On these previous occasions,  they said the political problem had to be solved politically and  insisted on surrender. Now the SLORC is doing the same. We  insisted on holding talks abroad because it insisted on  surrender without attempt to solve political problems by  political means. We want to hold talks abroad because we want  to establish genuine internal peace and discuss matters freely  as we wish. We want to work in a cordial manner in an attempt  to bring about internal peace. It is neither our desire nor  wish to obtain a cease-fire; we are striving for lasting peace.  The SLORC, however, does not accept this.    [Correspondent] I gather from what you just said that you  wish to hold talks with the SLORC not only on the limited matter  of a cease-fire, but on broad issues including political and  military matters and the issue of peace in the country. Is this  assessment correct?    [Mya] Yes. We want peace for the entire country and not just  peace between the Burmese and Karen. We want peace in the whole  of Burma.    [Correspondent] You said the SLORC rejected your suggestion.  According to one report we received, the SLORC verbally rejected  your proposal to hold talks in Thailand. Is this correct?    [Mya] That is correct. I met the military attache, but they  also did not accept this.    [Correspondent] There is a report that Khun Sa had proposed  an alliance with various ethnic groups, including the KNU. Is  this true?    [Mya] There was an offer from Khun Sa. Khun Sa had publicly  declared the formation of a republic. We sent some youths to  observe his declaration of a republic. We wanted to study the  extent of the Shan people's support and interest.    [Correspondent] The SLORC has alleged that representatives  of  the KNU, Mon, and Karenni met with Khun Sa to discuss a military  union. Would you like to comment on this?    [Mya] This is not true. It was not aimed at military union.  We wanted to observe whether they would fight after achieving  independence. As far as we observed, they will not fight the  SLORC, but will retaliate if the SLORC attacks them. That is  what we observed.    [Correspondent] That is all I would like to ask on the  current situation. Would you like to add anything, Gen. Bo Mya?    [Mya] The people of Burma are being oppressed and insulted  by  the SLORC. Other countries should consider this; they should  remember the suffering and hardship of the people of Burma and  come to our defense.    [Correspondent] I said I had no more questions, but I do  have  another question. Does the DAB remain as united as before?    [Mya] Yes. The DAB remains united, and there is much  understanding. Some organizations that already held talks with  the SLORC have become disappointed because the SLORC does as it  pleases, while some organizations are reestablishing contact  with us.    [Correspondent] The fourth anniversary of the general  elections in 27 May. What would you like to say in this regard?    [Mya] The people want genuine internal peace and full  democratic rights. They absolutely do not want the SLORC. The  people's judgment will eventually prevail.     "

The  program, which this week deals with the Middle East peace  process and Jordan's stand vis-a-vis this process, hosts  Jordanian Information Minister Dr. Jawad al-'Anani and  journalist Salamah Ni'mat.    The program moderator begins by reviewing the peace process  in light of the statements made by King Husayn after chairing  the cabinet session on 4 June. Analyzing the new developments  in the peace process, al-'Anani reviews the peace talks on the  Arab-Israeli tracks saying that the peace process is continuous  and changeable. He then says: ""The Jordanian position basically  derives its strength from a united Arab position on the external  level and from its domestic impregnability on the internal  front. We have our own circumstances, our own geography, and  our own demography which are known by all. Therefore, those who  fabricate rumors against Jordan or those who attempt to shake  the Jordanian negotiating stand are in fact encroaching on  Jordan's dignity in terms of demography and geography."" He adds  that Jordan intervened in light of the developments in the peace  process ""to guarantee Jordan's borders and geography."" He says:  ""Therefore, border demarcation has become, for Jordan, a  process that would avert the basic threat coming from Israel or  from its attempts to tamper with this matter. Also, we should  safeguard the demographic structure in Jordan. His majesty the  king has always stressed that we are one people who have equal  rights and duties.""    Journalist Salamah Ni'mat speaks about weak Arab  coordination  and deviation of the peace process from the Madrid framework,  saying that the PLO is interested in reaching an agreement that  serves its strategic interests which might be different from  Jordan's. He says that Jordan cannot wait until settlements are  reached between Israel and the other Arab sides.    Turning to the agenda signed by Jordan and Israel, al-'Anani  reviews the formation of the tripartite economic committee which  will meet in Washington on 6 June, adding that ""unofficial  talks"" will cover the issues of water and borders. He adds that  Israel claimed that the Jordanian side delayed the talks because  it insisted on not discussing the other issues, such as economic  issues, before settling the issues of border and water, saying  that these are basic Jordanian rights that must be addressed.  He says that Jordan has always tried to convince the United  States that Jordan does not want to obstruct the peace process,  but wants to achieve specific things. He says: ""If the Israeli  side shows enough flexibility in Washington -- something which  we will know soon -- and there is a need to form committees to  discuss the border and water issues on the ground it will be  useless to waste the opportunity by not forming technical  committees here on the ground -- that is, in the region.""    Asked if Jordan will resume talks on the Jordanian-Israeli  track in Washington within the resumption of all talks or will  agree on a new mechanism for implementation, al-'Anani says:  ""It is unfair to address this question to Jordan alone. The  Madrid equation does not concern Jordan alone; it concerns all  Arab tracks. If the Arab countries continue with the current  method of negotiations, would Jordan return to Washington alone?""    Asked if Jordan is ready to host the meetings of  Jordanian-Israeli committees, al-'Anani says: ""If this comes  within the framework of returning Jordanian territory and water,  the answer is yes. A team should be present on this side and  the other side. They should meet at the geographical site which  should be defined, not in any other place.""    Journalist Ni'mat then speaks about the Arab-Israeli  normalization process and requirements of the peace process. He  says that the majority of people does not attach great  importance if talks with the Israelis are moved to Jordan. The  information minister says that Jordan is prepared technically to  hold direct talks on the issue of borders here on the ground.    The information minister then touches on future  Jordanian-Palestinian relations and the importance of  concentrating on priorities. He says that Jordan seeks to  establish relations based on common interests. Ni'mat then  reviews Palestinian-Israeli agreements and their impact on  Jordanian-Palestinian relations.    Al-'Anani then speaks about the importance of stability and  security to achieve and maintain peace.     "
0,FT932-14716 ,"FT932-14716 _AN-DDRATAAVFT 930417   FT  17 APR 93 / Palestinians to seek peace talks postponement      By ROGER MATTHEWS, Middle East Editor   PALESTINIANS said yesterday that they would seek a delay in the resumption of Middle East peace talks scheduled to open in Washington on Tuesday. The proposal, in protest at Israel's deportation of 415 Palestinians, was put to a meeting of the four Arab delegations to the peace talks who gathered in Damascus yesterday for a two-day meeting aimed at reaching a joint response to the US-Russian invitation. Syria, Jordan and Lebanon have all expressed their desire to return to the negotiating table, but are reluctant to resume bilateral talks with Israel in the absence of the Palestinians. Mr Yassir Abed-Rabbo, who heads one of three PLO factions directing the Palestinian negotiators, said in Damascus: 'We did not say we are leaving the peace process. We are not quitting. All we are saying is let us postpone for a short period of time - we insist a short period of time - in order to reach a compromise.' He added that Israel's recent closure of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which had caused serious hardship by stopping 100,000 Palestinians crossing to work in Israel, had added a further obstacle. 'We have not received any clear and concrete answers,' Mr Abed-Rabbo said. 'There are various promises and ambiguous suggestions which do not convince us or convince Palestinian public opinion.' In the occupied West Bank, two Arabs died and seven Israeli soldiers were wounded yesterday when a bomb exploded in a roadside cafe. The attack appeared to be timed to increase tension in the run-up to the peace talks. Security forces said that an Arab had driven a truck at the cafe and had died when it exploded, causing serious damage and setting fire to vehicles parked nearby. The Palestinians whose expulsion from the West Bank and Gaza in December provoked the crisis in the peace process, launched their own protest yesterday by marching from their makeshift camp in south Lebanon towards Israeli military positions. Israeli troops responded with artillery and tank fire and the march was called off several hundred metres short of the positions after a shell injured one of the marchers. Mrs Hanan Ashrawi, the spokeswoman for the Palestinian delegation to the peace talks, said in Washington after two days of talks with US officials that it was not possible at this stage to recommend a resumption of the negotiations. The Palestinians have been pressing Israel to accelerate the timetable for allowing the men expelled to Lebanon to return home. They also want a commitment from Israel that it will not again carry out mass expulsions. President Bill Clinton has promised that the US will become more closely involved in the peace talks and together with Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, and President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, has expressed hope that substantial progress can be made this year. All sides have also agreed that no time limit will be placed on the next session, the ninth since the inaugural meeting in Madrid in October 1991.   Countries:-  ILZ  Israel, Middle East.

It was announced last night in Washington by US officials that the US and Russia were today expected to issue formal invitations to the foreign ministries of Israel, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon and to Palestinian leaders to resume Arab-Israeli peace talks in Washington on April 20. But Mr Haidar Abdel-Shafi told Reuters in Jerusalem that the talks would remain deadlocked as long as Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, reserved the right to deport people. Israel deported 415 Palestinians to southern Lebanon in December and has so far refused to implement fully UN Security Council resolution 799 which calls for their immediate return. Mr Abdel-Shafi's assessment of the peace process came shortly before Britain added its diplomatic weight to efforts to get the talks restarted by meeting representatives of the Palestine Liberation Organisation in London. Mr Douglas Hogg, minister at the Foreign Office, ended a two-year British ban on top-level contacts with the PLO in talks with Mr Faisal Husseini, the leading Palestinian in the occupied territories, Mr Hael Fahoum, who heads the PLO European section in Tunis, and Mr Afif Safieh, its London representative. Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, said yesterday his government would not be following the British example because of disappointment at the PLO's failure to be of assistance on terrorism issues. Britain informed the US in advance that it was resuming ministerial contacts with the PLO and did not encounter any opposition. Israel, however, complained about the resumption of British contacts, arguing that it would damage the peace process. Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO chairman, hoped that the British move and an earlier Belgian decision to upgrade the Palestinian mission in Brussels signalled a more positive European role in the peace process. Mr Hogg said after his meeting with the three Palestinians that they understood the importance of resuming bilateral negotiations with Israel. 'Further movement on the question of deportation would greatly facilitate their ability to come back into the talks,' he added. Mr Safieh described the meeting with Mr Hogg as 'warm, constructive and very promising'.   Countries:-  XNZ  Middle East.     ILZ  Israel, Middle East.   Industries:-  P9721 International Affairs.

But leaders in both countries stressed that Israel's deportation of Palestinians continued to obstruct a return to the talks, adjourned since mid-December. Mr Christopher said after meeting President Hafez al-Assad that the Syrian leader had 'emphasised his commitment to the process of direct negotiations' in the peace talks. King Hussein of Jordan told Mr Christopher on Saturday that he was anxious to return to the talks, but the continued exile of the Palestinians deported by Israel two months ago remained an obstacle. Mr Farouq al-Sharaa, Syrian foreign minister, made a similar statement on Mr Christopher's arrival in Damascus. The peace talks remained the sole option for countries in the region. 'What is the alternative except disaster?' he asked. 'Hopefully the obstacles can be removed from our path.' Mr Al-Sharaa told reporters he had advanced some new ideas to help resolve the impasse over the deportees, although he refused to give details. 'We shall work together to have the peace talks resume in a convenient and admirable atmosphere.' US officials have repeatedly stated that the secretary of state has no immediate plans to resolve the stalemate over the deportees. Officials travelling with Mr Christopher said he would, at best, gently encourage Israel to speed up a judicial review of the deportees' cases. Mr Christopher said over the weekend that he stood by a formula worked out between Israel and the US whereby Israel would take back 101 of the 396 men immediately and the rest within a year. Arab parties to the peace talks have rejected this. Mr Christopher flew last night to Saudi Arabia for a brief visit before he travels to Kuwait, where talks are more likely to focus on Gulf security issues than on the peace process.

0,FT944-2509 ,"FT944-2509 _AN-ELSBNAAPFT 941216   FT  16 DEC 94 / Calm hand at helm of uneasy coalition: The challenges facing John Bruton as Ireland's new premier      by JOHN MURRAY BROWN   Mr John Bruton was once described as 'John Unionist' by Mr Albert Reynolds, the man he succeeded yesterday as Ireland's new prime minister. It was an unfortunate slip of the tongue. Nonetheless, the inadvertent allusion to Mr Bruton's views on Northern Ireland highlights one of the key differences in government policy likely to emerge with his accession yesterday as head of a three-party coalition between his Fine Gael party, Labour and the small Democratic Left. The feeling in Dublin last night was one of relief after a month of deliberations and allegations, which had left Ireland in the hands of a caretaker administration since the collapse of the Fianna Fail-Labour coalition after a judicial appointment row. The delay had cast an ill-timed shadow over the Northern Ireland peace process, straining relations between Dublin and Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, and halting negotiations on the joint framework document which Ireland and the UK hope will form the basis for all-party talks on Ulster's constitutional future. Ireland still faces a hectic diplomatic agenda, with Dublin due to host the European Union's 1996 intergovernmental conference. Some analysts yesterday predicted the coalition might not survive that long. The potential for discord within such a wide-ranging coalition is clear. Fianna Fail, licking its wounds on the opposition benches, is in no mood to be forgiving. Mr Bruton's Fine Gael is a rural-based conservative party with largely middle class support which has lost votes to Mr Dick Spring's more urban Labour party. Meanwhile, Mr Proinsias De Rossa's Democratic Left is an old-fashioned socialist party and the successor of the Official IRA, when the Provisional IRA broke away to pursue the armed struggle in 1970. Even at the last minute yesterday, Democratic Left looked set to pull out of negotiations once it became clear the party, which has just six seats in the Dail, was being offered a single cabinet portfolio. Last night the single overriding preoccupation of all the parties seemed to be a determination to see Fianna Fail consigned to the opposition. In Mr Bruton, the government will have calm if uncharismatic leadership. A former finance minister, he is a plain speaking barrister with 20 years in the Dail and a wealth of ministerial experience. Politically he is said to be close to the rural wing of the party, identified with Mr Liam Cosgrave, a former prime minister. In February Mr Bruton rode out a leadership challenge, and still could be vulnerable to attack from the liberal wing of the party associated with another former premier, Dr Garret Fitzgerald. Mr Bruton likes to dub Fine Gael as 'part of the great European Christian Democrat movement'. He campaigned in favour of divorce reform, where there will be a meeting of minds with Labour and Democratic Left. On the North, the strains may be difficult to hide. Fine Gael is historically identified as the party which voted for the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921, which created partition. As a believer in a more accommodating stance towards the Unionists, Mr Bruton is likely to push for reform of Articles 2 and 3 of the constitution, which enshrine Ireland's territorial claim to Northern Ireland. London in particular is keen to see that Fianna Fail, which has played a key role in the peace process so far, should not now be isolated. The party, as the voice of constitutional republicanism (Fianna Fail voted against the Treaty) enjoys better relations with Sinn Fein than the other parties. As a result, Fianna Fail's support could be critical if the coalition is to steer through constitutional reform, which would have to be put to a referendum. On the economy, the coalition's problems are perhaps more acute. Mr Bruton is sometimes described as Thatcherite on economic policy and he certainly won a reputation for tight spending policies when in charge of finance in 1982 after the profligate years of Mr Charles Haughey's Fianna Fail government. Any attempt by Fine Gael to cut taxes and reduce public spending is likely to be resisted by Labour and Democratic Left.   Countries:-  IEZ  Ireland, EC.

The 'peace grants', targeted mainly on creating jobs and improving infrastructure, could total Ecu625m (Pounds 490m) in new money between 1995 and 1999. Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president, briefed foreign ministers meeting in Brussels on the shape of the peace package, put together for the whole of Northern Ireland and the six bordering counties of the Irish Republic. The Commission is expected to agree a final proposal for Essen on December 7, and has been consulting widely at grassroots level in the pro-British Unionist and Irish nationalist communities in the province. Senior officials in London and Dublin say both governments endorse the initiative. 'It's virtually gift-wrapped for Essen,' one Irish official said. Brussels is suggesting an initial commitment of Ecu300m from the EU budget for 1995-97, with an extension of the same rate of new funding - Ecu100m a year - for a further two years if the scheme is working. About 80 per cent of this would go to Northern Ireland and the rest to the bordering counties. The UK and Ireland would contribute additional new money, worth 25 per cent of the new EU funds spent within their territory, for a total potential package of Ecu625m. Britain, which has clashed with the Commission in the past about the normal legal requirement to 'match' EU aid with 'additional', or genuinely new money, says there will be no repackaging of already committed funding for the province. Mr John Major, British prime minister, gave a public commitment in Belfast late last month that the UK would put in new funding to match extra EU grants. The EU has already committed Ecu1.23bn to Northern Ireland in 1994-99, under the structural funds aid programme, as well as Ecu20m a year to the multinational International Fund for Ireland.

These quarters have stressed the importance  of this summit for the peace process, noting what it could offer  to achieve a just, comprehensive peace in the region if the U.S.  Administration shows understanding of the facts of the conflict  in the region. As these quarters believe, it is no longer  acceptable for the U.S. position to remain within a theoretical  framework. This is especially so, since the U.S. Administration  is the party that launched the peace process on the basis of UN  resolutions and the principle of land for peace.    More than two years have passed since the peace process was  launched. Israel, however, has continued to play the same role,  namely, refusing to comply with international resolutions and  the foundations of the peace process. This resulted in wasting  an opportunity deemed by observers as historic when the Madrid  conference convened and then resumed in Washington.    AL-BA'TH adds: Unlike the Arab parties, Israel went to the  Madrid conference and the Washington talks not to commit itself  to the foundations of the Madrid conference but to exploit the  peace talks to achieve its aims which it has sought for a long  time through various means. Therefore, the peace talks have not  made progress because of this Israeli attitude.    The paper thinks that the recent U.S. move came after the  U.S. Administration felt that the entire peace process was in  danger, especially since it is now convinced -- this is apparent  through official statements -- that partial, separate solutions  would never achieve genuine peace.    Consequently, AL-BA'TH adds, the U.S. Administration insists  always that comprehensive settlement in the region would bring  peace, security, and stability to the region and that any peace  without Syria and Lebanon is not considered peace. The summit  between Presidents al-Asad and Clinton this month comes against  this background. It is presumed, as Arab and foreign quarters  point out, that this summit will focus on the need to salvage  the peace process which is threatened by Israel's position.  These quarters assert, moreover, that it all depends on the  U.S. Administration's position, especially since Syria has a  very clear position on the peace process and is very much  concerned about achieving a just and comprehensive settlement.

The Burmese junta recently held peace talks with Kachin  rebels in the north and with the Mon.    More talks were expected with other dissident minority  groups  such as the Karen and those in Shan state, Gen Charan said.    Earlier, the Karen National Union [KNU], the strongest  anti-Rangoon minority group, called on the ruling State Law and  Order Restoration Council to hold peace talks on equal terms  with all minority groups to ensure rights and freedom in all  economic social and political fields.    The KNU threatened not to talk if its conditions were not  accepted by the SLORC.    Western sources criticised Rangoon's move as a deceitful  tactic to get minorities to bow down to the junta.    They cited the government's refusal to release Nobel Peace  Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi who has been under house arrest  for five years.    Gen Charan said he did not know if Aung San Suu Kyi might be  released, but he disagreed with the criticism, saying there was  no reason for the junta to play a trick on the minorities as it  might stir hatred and resistance.    ""The Burmese junta is trying to be more open to the world  community as the West is condemning its undemocratic system,""  said Gen Charan.    ""However, we have to accept that change needs time.    ""Thailand always supports peace talks and clings to the  belief that any slaughter of minorities should be condemned by  the world community.""    Gen Charan spoke of Thailand's neutral stance on Burmese  affairs, saying the Government would not interfere with the  conflicts even though some minority groups which did not trust  the Burmese government were asking for help from Thailand.    The talks might proceed well, he said.    One thorn still obstructs the peace in Burma, according to  Gen Charan, as the junta has to attack the strongholds of opium  warlord Khun Sa, who is notoriously influential in Shan State.    Khun Sa's group is believed to survive on money gained from  trading in narcotics.    Shan State used to be the homeland of Thai Yai, but is now  occupied by Chinese Haw and hill-tribe people.    Thailand and Burma are expected to hold talks on the opening  of Tah Kee Lek checkpoint opposite Mae Sai district as the  Burmese government is relaxing its regulations by allowing  foreigners to cross the Thai border.    The move is to promote trade and tourism.    Tah Kee Lek used to be a permanent checkpoint but was closed  after political upheavals in Burma.    Since then it has been opened on a temporary basis.     "

One that is, of course, also very important. We know you are  all waiting eagerly for this information. We are referring to  the situation in San Cristobal de las Casas, Chiapas, where the  peace and reconciliation talks are being held. The usual news  conference was not held after the fifth day of talks today.  During this week, Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho,  Subcommander Marcos on behalf of the EZLN [Zapatist National  Liberation Army], and Bishop Samuel Ruiz, as mediator in this  conflict, held a daily news conference to give an update of the  talks to reporters at approximately 1800 to 1830.    Good evening, Jose Luis Sarmiento in San Cristobal de las  Casas. Can you tell us what happened? Why was there no news  conference?    [Sarmiento] As you said, there will be no statements to the  press on advances in the peace and reconciliation talks in  Chiapas. Francisco de los Santos, the official spokesman of the  San Cristobal de las Casas bishopric, reported there will be no  reports on the talks between Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho  Solis and the EZLN delegates until further notice. This is all  we were told. We were also told the EZLN list of demands  received positive responses.    [Announcer] We understood from the information you reported  to the first edition of the ACIR Radio News newscast at 1300  that Subcommander Marcos met with reporters who write for  newspapers in Mexican states and told them there is still a long  road to traverse to achieve peace with dignity, although  important advances had been made and significant points  resolved, 50 percent of them positively. He also said the talks  are now entering a more difficult stage.    [Sarmiento] Correct. As you reported Subcommander Marcos  said this morning the most difficult part of the talks for peace  and reconciliation in Chiapas had begun. He said peace will not  come out of San Cristobal de las Casas, only the mechanisms to  reach it. He said, as you already stated, although there have  been favorable responses to problems--especially those dealing  with health, housing, education, among others--in the Chiapas  Indian communities, those are local demands. They now also  expect a positive response to their national demands, such as  justice, land, liberty, and self- government for all the Indian  communities in the country.    [Begin Subcommander Marcos recording] The points that have  yet to be discussed are the most difficult ones. We decided to  start with the points that were apparently easier to resolve, so  as to advance. The most difficult, controversial points are  the ones that follow. The talks will become more difficult,  because now we will discuss demands the companeros have asked,  not for themselves, rather, for the country. [Words indistinct]  respect for the Indians, [words indistinct] self-government  program, reform of the Fourth Article, guaranteed  self-government, and other measures [words indistinct] [end  recording]    [Sarmiento] Subcommander Marcos and the 18 EZLN delegates  who  are participating in the talks, as you said, met with  representatives of the provincial newspapers in Mexico this  morning.    In addition, the seven bishops who comprise the  Reconciliation Commission, which is presided by Adolfo Suarez  Rivera, visited the Chiapas highlands for the third time. They  said they have already seen encouraging signs in favor of peace;  nevertheless, they called on Mexican society not to close their  hearts to the just demands of the communities. Tapachula  Chiapas Bishop Felipe Arizmendi stated:    [Begin Arizmendi recording] I hope we do not close our minds  and hearts to hear the community's just demands. From the  start, the three Chiapas bishops have stated we do not agree  with the armed action, but it should serve as a warning, because  violence will erupt at any time and in any manner if margined  groups are neglected. [end recording]    [Sarmiento] All the domestic and foreign reporters who are  here in San Cristobal de las Casas are still attentive to the  peace and reconciliation talks.     "

But despite tough conditions for its participation being set by the PLO, the US is still hoping to bring negotiators from the two sides to Washington. Senior PLO officials gathered late last night at the villa of Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman, for an emergency meeting. Before the deliberations began, Mr Arafat dismissed as 'empty' and 'hollow' the Israeli cabinet's decision to disarm the most extremist groups among the settlers. PLO officials also said they considered the 'goodwill gesture' of offering the release of 800-1,000 Palestinian prisoners to be insufficient. The officials said they expected the PLO to refuse to accept a US invitation to resume peace negotiations in Washington on Wednesday without tougher action from Israel. Mr Nabil Shaath, the PLO's chief negotiator in detailed talks on an eventual Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho, said before last night's meeting that the PLO had accepted the invitation only in principle. He said: 'There are requirements for continuation of the talks - mainly the protection of the Palestinians from the settlers.' PLO officials said they expected a statement from the Tunis meeting to include questions on exactly which and how many Jewish settlers Israel intended to disarm. However, Mr Shaath explicitly refused to call such requirements 'preconditions', suggesting that however bitter the reaction to the massacre in Hebron on Friday of more than 40 Palestinians, many in the PLO feel it cannot be allowed to jeopardise the talks altogether. In Washington, President Bill Clinton telephoned Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, and President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt on Saturday evening in an effort to keep the peace talks moving in the wake of Friday's massacre in a Hebron mosque. 'Mubarak said he would do everything he could with Arafat and Rabin to keep the process going and that he was confident the talks could be kept on track,' a White House official said. US officials said emotions were clearly running high after Friday's attack, but the best way of meeting Palestinian demands for better security guarantees in the West Bank was to complete the peace process. 'If in fact we can move as quickly as possible to an agreement and implementation, that's the best way to change the realities on the ground in a way that will also discredit those who are determined to try to do it (the peace process) in,' a senior administration official said.

Mr Itamar Rabinovich, Israel's chief negotiator with Syria, said yesterday the Syrians wanted a comprehensive settlement. He said the way the talks were taking shape as security discussions between two states at peace had shown that Syria's concept of peace is more far-reaching than the Israeli government thought. Mr Yitzak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, has so far refused to specify the extent of any withdrawal until Syria agrees openly to a 'full peace' including diplomatic relations, trade and open borders. However, it would be unlikely for Damascus to sign an agreement with Israel before substantial progress on the Israeli-Palestinian track of the Arab-Israeli peace talks. Signs of Israeli optimism on the Syrian track came a day after the Clinton administration said for the first time it might be willing to guarantee security arrangements for the Golan deal. However, on a visit to the northern border on Tuesday Mr Rabin said: 'We'll make an effort not to pay this time the price we paid for the peace with Egypt' - a reference to Israel's complete return of the occupied Sinai to Egypt in exchange for peace in 1979. Despite continued government spending in the Golan Heights, Mr Avraham Shochat, Israeli finance minister, said yesterday that he had told businessmen planning to invest millions of dollars in the occupied territory that investment was inadvisable in the long term.

0,FT933-13587 ,"FT933-13587 _AN-DGSCZAATFT 930719   FT  19 JUL 93 / Bosnia threatens to boycott talks: Izetbegovic demands end to Serb advance on Sarajevo      By LAURA SILBER and FRANCES WILLIAMS      BELGRADE, GENEVA   MR Alija Izetbegovic, the president of Bosnia, yesterday said he would boycott peace talks in Geneva if Serb forces pressed forward with their assault on Sarajevo. Bosnian radio said Serb forces breached defence lines in three places on Mount Igman, an important Moslem stronghold. Fighting was also reported in Hadzici, just west of Sarajevo, where UN officials spotted 16 Serb tanks last week. The Serb advance is aimed at forcing Mr Izetbegovic to accept the republic's ethnic partition, which he opposes as a legitimisation of 'ethnic cleansing'. However, in an apparent retreat on his position, Mr Izetbegovic - who faces growing international pressure to reach a peace settlement - last night said that Bosnia might have to be divided along ethnic lines to end the bloodshed. In an address carried by Bosnian radio, he said: 'We should not accept a permanent division of Bosnia. But without great concessions in terms of ethnic division, there is no way to get peace in the near future. 'Maybe we could solve this dilemma if we are ready to continue fighting (against Serbs and Croats) for one more year. But if we want peace now, concessions are inevitable.' A week ago Bosnia's collective presidency drafted a peace plan calling for preserving Bosnia intact as a federal, multi-ethnic state with equal rights for Serbs, Moslems and Croats. Serbian and Croatian leaders, meeting in Geneva at the weekend, denied attempts to carve up Bosnia between them and said their proposal for a loose confederation of three ethnic mini-states was the only way to lasting peace. President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia and President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia, in a statement after talks with Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, the international mediators for former Yugoslavia, said speculation on a two-way division of Bosnia was 'unfounded'. But Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic has given tomorrow as the deadline for the Bosnian government to accept partition along ethnic lines. If not, he told a Belgrade newspaper yesterday, the government faces 'total defeat'. The presidents of Serbia and Croatia plan to return to Geneva tomorrow or on Wednesday if the mediators succeed in convening a new round of talks on a confederal peace plan for Bosnia involving all parties. The Bosnian Serbs and Croats support the plan and some members of the collective Bosnian presidency have said they would discuss it. Mr Izetbegovic reiterated that peace talks could not take place while Serb forces tightened their stranglehold on Bosnian government targets. 'We cannot go there if offensive activities in Bosnia continue, especially against Sarajevo,' he said after talks with Mr Vitaly Churkin, Russian President Boris Yeltsin's peace envoy. In an interview with a Belgrade newspaper, General Ratko Mladic, Bosnian Serb commander, warned: 'It is up to Alija and those who advise him to think what to do. I have left Sarajevo to the end.'

Stressing that  acts of violence must now come to an end, the president issued  the directive during a three-hour meeting with the members of  the three peace panels headed by Professor Alfredo Tadiar and  former Ambassadors Howard Dee and Manuel Yan.    Based on their reports, the chief executive noted that the  panels are too cautious about possible legal implications that  may arise from the their actions thus slowing their conduct of  the peace process. Let me make it very clear that the objective  of the peace talks is to stop the violence and the bloodshed,  while maintaining our traditional and permanent position of not  compromising Philippine sovereignty, the president reminded the  group. To achieve that objective I think we should not be too  legalistic at this point in time, the important thing is to  accomplish the first step which is to stop the violence, he said.    Some of the panel members expressed concern that the  Congress  might question in the future, the legality or the  constitutionality of their decisions. However, Ramos gave them  the authority to pursue whatever they think will expedite the  conduct of the peace process, saying that whatever legal  questions might arise could probably be resolved later on.    The president also assessed that the government's efforts to  stop [words indistinct] long and lasting peace have borne  significant results. I think we are achieving the result that  we want which is the reduction of violence but we should not  lose sight of the fact that although violence has been reduced,  it is a fact that there are still people dying out there in the  field, he pointed out.    The chief executive called on every local government  official  to fully support the initiatives of the peace panels. He  specifically asked the local officials in Mindanao to coordinate  their actions with the group of former Ambassador Yan. He  received reports that certain governors and other local  officials are making moves without consulting the Yan panel.  There are still possible clash points and if we are not  careful, they might undermine the peace process he said.    During the meeting the president was briefed by the panels  on  the progress of their respective peace talks. Tadiar said that  his group will have an informal meeting with the RAM-SFP-YOU  [Rebolusyonaryong Alyansang Makabayan; Nationalist  Revolutionary Alliance-Soldiers of the Filipino People-Young  Officers Union] which is tentatively scheduled tomorrow, 23  March. He said the meeting will be the first after the talks  stalled last December.    Yan reported that his panel and the MNLF [Moro National  Liberation Front] mixed-committee are scheduled to resume their  meeting tentatively on 4 to 6 April. He said the venues are  still being worked out.    Dee said that the National Democratic Front [NDF] has  backtracked from the planned Vietnam exploratory talks because  of their demand for the withdrawal of Executive Order 125.  Executive Order 125 signed by the president on 13 September of  last year defined the approach and administrative structures for  the government's comprehensive peace efforts. They also  demanded that preliminary talks be conducted in Europe prior to  the Vietnam meet last 16 March. The Dee panel sent a letter to  the NDF pressing for the meeting and informing the leadership of  a possible amnesty proclamation. They have yet to respond to  our letter, Dee said.     "

They met after Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams offered what  sounded like new hope of ending the sectarian slaughter, saying  he was convinced a settlement would come out of the peace  process.    He indicated there would be a Sinn Fein response to the  Downing Street declaration of December 15 after the June 9  European elections.    However, there were the first signs today that Sinn Fein,  the  IRA's political wing, is suffering internal tensions over its  approach.    Members critical of the leadership were accused of trying to  damage the peace process.    Mr. Adams told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I am quite  convinced that what is going to come out of this peace process  is a peace settlement -- I am quite convinced about it. It is a  significant step.    ""It is part of one of those steps which are required to  advance the peace process. It addresses some of the core issues  and it dismisses some of the other questions.""    He said the fact that the British Government had responded  to  Sinn Fein's list of questions about the Downing Street  declaration was in itself ""very significant"".    Meanwhile, Mr. Major and Mr. Reynolds were meeting against a  background of continuing terrorist violence.    Prime aim of their discussions was to consider the reaction  to a detailed British response a week ago to Sinn Fein's request  for clarification of their peace declaration.    But persistent gun and bomb attacks in Northern Ireland and,  last weekend, in the Irish Republic -- when Ulster Loyalist  paramilitaries shot an IRA man in a Dublin bar -- ensured that  security issues would remain high on the agenda for tonight's  exchanges.    The two leaders were also due to assess progress made by  officials from their two governments towards establishing a  framework for resuming all-party cross-border talks on Ulster's  future. Those discussions stalled near the end of 1992 after a  series of disagreements.    Since then, Northern Ireland Office ministers have been  involved in behind-the-scenes meetings with party officials in a  bid to kick-start the talks process.    Meetings between officials are thought to have made advances  towards a timetable for beginning the inter-party discussions  again. But it is thought likely to be the end of the summer  before meaningful talks get under way.     "

Mr Arafat told the Middle East News Agency in Cairo that he would be asking President Hosni Mubarak, the Egyptian leader, to explain the Palestinian position when he meets President Bill Clinton in Washington on April 6. Mr Mubarak will visit Germany and Britain this week before heading off to the US. On Saturday he held talks in Cairo with President Hafez al-Assad of Syria in an effort to reach a joint Arab response to the American invitation to resume peace negotiations in Washington on April 20. The foreign ministers of Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt and the PLO also met in Damascus yesterday to consider the US invitation. But Mr Arafat said the PLO executive committee wanted an opportunity to assess the result of current talks in Washington between members of the Palestinian peace talks delegation and US officials before reaching a final decision. The Palestinians have so far declined to accept the US invitation without an assurance from Israel that it will stop mass deportation of people from the occupied territories. The demand stemmed from Israel's deportation of 415 Palestinians on December 17. The Israeli army said it would bar the 750,000 Palestinians living in occupied Gaza from entering Israel for an indefinite period in response to a recent upsurge in Israeli-Arab violence, Reuter reports from Jerusalem. Earlier, military officials said two Palestinians had stabbed to death a Jew and Israeli troops shot dead an Arab in Gaza.

The bombing was condemned as 'revolting' by Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, reflecting British concern that loyalist violence could threaten the open-ended IRA ceasefire announced last month. Mr Pat Doherty, a senior official of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, accused the UVF of trying to force the Dublin government to abandon direct contacts with republicans. 'The loyalist hope is that fear of the conflict being brought 'down here' will scupper the peace process,' he said. Mr John Hume, leader of the moderate nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party, said he was confident the IRA would not retaliate because Sinn Fein's leadership was 'totally committed' to the peace process. Mrs Maire Geoghegan-Quinn, the Irish justice minister, said the attack would not deflect the Dublin government from its strategy of consolidating the republican ceasefire by talking directly to Sinn Fein. British officials believe the US is likely to grant a visa to Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, at the Irish government's request, as part of the Irish strategy of drawing Sinn Fein into mainstream politics. However, Downing Street believes President Clinton and administration officials will avoid a direct meeting with Mr Adams for fear of weakening unionist support for the peace process. The Dublin bomb exploded as an express train from Belfast was pulling into Connolly station in the city centre. Two women were slightly hurt. Irish police said the explosion was caused by a detonator which failed to ignite a 2kg explosive charge, suggesting that casualties could have been higher. The UVF, which bombed a Dublin pub three months ago, said it had planted bombs in seven other locations in the city. None was found. The bombing reflects loyalist suspicion of a deal between Britain and the IRA, and confirms that Protestant terrorists are prepared to take their campaign to the Irish Republic. The Combined Loyalist Military Command, representing the UVF and the Ulster Freedom Fighters said last week a loyalist ceasefire would depend on assurances that no deal had been done. Loyalists are also concerned about the implications of a 'framework' document for Northern Ireland's future being drawn up by the British and Irish governments as part of the peace process.

Yet the British Government insisted  yesterday that the peace process begun through the Downing  Street Declaration, which was agreed to in December with the  Republic of Ireland, ""still stands"" and ""needs no clarification.""    The IRA issued its first response to the declaration at  about  midnight on 12 December. It emphasized the need for John  Major's government ""to abandon its negative attitude,"" a key  phrase used by the Catholic and republican organization to  reassert its demand for the ""clarification"" of certain points in  a text that seeks to appease all without satisfying anyone. The  complex political scenario of Northern Ireland encompasses two  countries -- the Republic of Ireland and Great Britain -- with  violent and peaceful Catholic nationalists; legal and  clandestine Protestants. Sinn Fein holds a particularly  important place as the political wing of the IRA and the  mandatory representative in any negotiation with the IRA.  Caoimghin O'Crolrin, a Sinn Fein National Executive Board  member, told PAGINA/12: ""The Downing Street Declaration is not  dead."" During a long telephone interview, O'Crolrin explained  that the IRA attacks are a variant of the IRA's policy which  seeks to ""involve the British in different fields,"" by forcing  them to respond politically and militarily. Within this  context, O'Crolrin, who insisted he was speaking on behalf of  Sinn Fein, did not reject the possibility of further IRA attacks.    [PAGINA/12] Is it not contradictory to talk about achieving  peace while attacking one of the busiest airports in the world?    [O'Crolrin] Sinn Fein deplores all violent actions. We do  not want any violence -- from the IRA, from the British  Government, or from its surrogate Protestant paramilitary  groups. But we do not condemn violence out of context.  Violence can only be eliminated if all parties cease to use it,  including the British Government. Moreover, we believe the IRA  communique issued last night was positive because it clearly  shows a willingness to achieve peace. This is how it was viewed  in Ireland: As the expression of the desire to continue the  negotiations. The British media interpreted it differently. To  put it more plainly, the British media interpreted the opposite.  The IRA communique urges the government to discontinue its  negative attitude, which became obvious when it rejected the  peace plan that was agreed last year by Sinn Fein President  Gerry Adams and Social Democratic Party President John Hume.  Despite this, we do not reject the Downing Street Declaration:  We consider it ambiguous, which is the way it has been  interpreted by a wide political spectrum. We have thus  requested an explanation. The Irish Government has given us an  explanation but they can only speak on behalf of the Irish  Government. The British Government has so far refused to do so.  Yet John Major had no qualms in granting an explanation at the  time to Protestant Unionist parties.    [PAGINA/12] What must the British Government explain to  convince the IRA to renounce violence?    [O'Crolrin] We accept no preconditions for negotiations.  When the British Government hosted the Bosnia-Herzegovina  negotiations in 1992 it did not establish any prerequisites. It  seems that it does so with the Sinn Fein and the IRA. Not just  the surrender of arms but -- to use British Government  terminology -- the establishment of a ""purification"" period.  The British Government is the one that must ""purify"" itself  before negotiating with us. We are neither the second rate  citizens of a nation nor will we be treated as a scourge. But  beyond all this, there are certain issues that must be  explained. The declaration states that it supports Ireland's  self determination but adds that it demands the consent of the  people.    [PAGINA/12] The stumbling block of the declaration seems to  be that it seeks to satisfy the Protestant Unionist -- by  stating that it will not modify anything without their consent  -- and the Catholics -- by stating that it seeks the self  determination for Ireland, which is precisely what the Unionists  do not want. What is the solution?    [O'Crolrin] For us the issue began in 1921 when -- against  the wishes of the Irish -- their country was divided. Only  within the context of national democracy, reconciliation, and  lasting peace can we go forward. We have a series of proposals  within this framework. It is obvious that we do not think we  have a monopoly on anything. We will listen to all options  proposed by other political groups. This, of course, includes  the Protestants who are an important part of our society. But  we reject the idea that any sector has the right to veto anyone  because such an action goes against democratic principles in any  society in the world. Unfortunately, this is one interpretation  of the Downing Street Declaration. This is why the British  Government must clarify the declaration or it will lose a  historic opportunity of achieving peace.     "

Prime Minister Abdel Salam al-Majali is expected to keep his post but officials say new faces will be brought into other key positions to 'reinvigorate' the government and its efforts in the peace process. The change came amid optimism from the Jordanians that a breakthrough in its peace talks with Israel was imminent. On Monday, Jordan and Israel restarted direct talks in Washington on their peace agenda signed in September last year. Officials in Amman said they expected the two sides to agree to set up a joint committee to examine the countries' land dispute. The border between Jordan and Israel has never been formally recognised; both sides are said to see the need to settle territorial issues before moving to others such as water, economic co-operation and refugees. It was not clear last night who would appear in the new cabinet. The lower house of parliament has been calling for representation of MPs at cabinet level, as in previous governments, but a former minister said this 'was doubtful'. The last cabinet reshuffle came after the kingdom held its first multi-party elections last November. Since then, the government and parliament have had frequent stand-offs. The cabinet has come in for criticism over its handling of talks with the Palestinian Liberation Organisation on future economic ties between Jordan and the West Bank. One former prime minister, Mr Ahmad Obediat, said the old cabinet lacked clear policies; he blamed its members for the uncertainty in the kingdom. The new cabinet, it is hoped, will be able to restore confidence in the peace talks.   Countries:-  JOZ  Jordan, Middle East.   Industries:-  P9199 General Government, NEC.

0,FT934-16338 ,"FT934-16338 _AN-DJGCLAA0FT 931007   FT  07 OCT 93 / Israel and PLO to press on with peace talks      By MARK NICHOLSON      CAIRO   ISRAEL and the Palestine Liberation Organisation will open talks on implementing their historic peace agreement in Egypt on October 13, Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, and Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO chairman, said after an unexpectedly productive mini-summit yesterday. Mr Rabin, who said he had called for the quickly-arranged talks, described them as 'constructive and positive' and a 'very good beginning' to implementation of the outline peace deal signed on the White House lawns three weeks ago. He told reporters: 'We are committed to whatever we signed - but it's not enough to sign, you have to translate it through negotiation into reality.' The two leaders accordingly agreed to set up four joint negotiating committees to cover all aspects of the deal which will give limited self-rule to the Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank. At least two of the groups will convene in Egypt, satisfying in small part a long-standing Israeli call to move elements of the peace process from Washington to the Middle East. The agreement to begin implementation talks on October 13 follows the schedule of the outline accord signed in Washington. But the progress came as a surprise, given PLO anger over recent tough Israeli security operations against Palestinian activists in Gaza and the West Bank. PLO officials had accused Israel of 'flagrant violation of the spirit' of the accord. But while Mr Rabin declined to repeat his historic Washington handshake with Mr Arafat for the benefit of the cameras, and the leaders insisted on separate news conferences, no such bitterness was allowed to mar what Mr Rabin called simply 'a working meeting'. Under yesterday's agreement, Israel and the PLO will form a joint liaison committee at ministerial level to supervise implementation of the outline peace deal. This group will start work in Cairo next Wednesday. The same day a second joint committee will start talks in Taba, the Egyptian Red Sea resort near the Israeli border, on the Israeli military withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho. The pull-out is set to start on December 13. A third economic committee will also be established, the details and venue for which will be decided by the liaison committee. A further series of talks will continue under the framework of the 22-month-old Washington peace talks on the powers of a Palestinian Council due for election in July and details of Palestinian 'early empowerment' over a range of administrative and civic functions across the West Bank. The separate bilateral talks between Israel and its other Arab neighbours - Jordan, Syria and Lebanon - are expected to continue in the US capital. No date has been set for the resumption of these talks since the adjournment of the 11th round last month. Mr Arafat also suggested there was progress on the supremely contentious issue of Jerusalem's status, saying they had appointed negotiators to discuss proposals to include in the peace process the city both sides consider as their historic capital. 'We agreed from my side (PLO negotiator) Faisal Husseini and someone else from the Israeli side will be appointed to deal with the issue of Jerusalem,' Mr Arafat said. But an Israeli official dismissed the notion that anyone had been detailed to deal with Jerusalem at this stage, saying the city's status was a subject only for talks on a permanent solution in more than two years' time. Where Jerusalem was concerned Israel had agreed only to 'look into' PLO requests that Palestinians from the occupied territories be allowed freer access to the city. Israel currently limits the numbers of Palestinians allowed to cross from the West Bank and Gaza. Both sides had agreed to defer the issue of Jerusalem during the secret Oslo negotiations which led up to the breakthrough agreement signed last month. In the Cairo meeting hosted by President Hosni Mubarak, Mr Rabin resisted any ceremonials, telling reporters: 'We believe the time has come to move from ceremonies, photo opportunities, handshakes, to move from that to business'. Neither did Mr Rabin offer any 'confidence-building' gestures, such as the release of Palestinian detainees in Israel, which Mr Arafat was believed to have sought. Discussion of Israeli security operations in Gaza and the West Bank were also referred to the new liaison committee next week.   Countries:-  ILZ  Israel, Middle East.     EGZ  Egypt, Africa.

No details have been made available concerning the meeting,  but diplomatic sources have described it as cordial and very  encouraging. That meeting of yesterday appears to have  surprised many and it took place without the presence of either  the mediators or the observers.    The Lusaka peace talks will continue until UNITA and the  MPLA-PT have reached an agreement. In Luanda yesterday, UN  Special Representative Alioune Blondin Beye said no deadline had  been set for the talks. Asked to comment on whether four months  of negotiation was not excessive, Blondin Beye replied that in  view of the fact that the conflict had been going on for 18  years, four months should not be seen as a sign of despair.    Through Dr. Jorge Alicerces Valentim, its spokesman in the  Zambian capital, UNITA has made it known that it will not leave  Lusaka without a peace accord.    Meanwhile, UN sources have disclosed that the UN special  representative in Angola could travel to the city of Huambo this  week to hold talks with the UNITA leadership. Attentive  observers believe that Blondin Beye must have received new  guidelines concerning methods to deal with the marathon Lusaka  peace talks.

The seventh round of talks since last year's Madrid peace conference reconvened after a 12-day pause for the US presidential election and is due to continue until November 19. Mr Itamar Rabinovich, Israel's chief negotiator in talks with Syria, was in tough mood, seeking a statement that Damascus was not involved in weekend clashes in Lebanon. Pro-Iranian guerrillas had fired salvos of Katyusha rockets into northern Israel and Israel's south Lebanon security zone late on Sunday in apparent retaliation for an Israeli air raid that killed four guerrillas. Mr Rabinovich said Israel had not changed its positions in this round despite a deadlock with the Syrians on their demand for a total withdrawal from the occupied Golan Heights and Israel's counter-demand for a Syrian commitment to sign a peace treaty. Israel is negotiating with Jordan, Lebanon and Palestinians from the occupied territories, as well as Syria. Few people expect breakthroughs before the Clinton team is in place. If they are contemplating any significant concessions, the parties might want to keep them up their sleeves until then. By the same token, it is in nobody's interest to annoy the new US leader by provoking a crisis.  The Financial Times   London Page 6  "

'We have to produce a demilitarised nation,' he added at Kennedy airport immediately after arriving from Dublin. 'I want to see an end to all armed conflict in Ireland,' he continued at a press conference. 'The Irish and British people deserve peace.' Asked if the IRA supported a ceasefire, Mr Adams said: 'I don't speak for the IRA; I speak for Sinn Fein.' But he added: 'The largest military presence in the north of Ireland is the British army, followed by the allies of the loyalists and then the IRA. I want to see them all disarmed.' Asked if the British should leave Northern Ireland, Mr Adams said that was not necessary if they became part of the peace process. 'They have to become the persuaders. Once they become part of the peace process then we will be able to build a peaceful country.' Speaking on CNN television last night, Mr Adams reiterated his support for a peaceful solution to the problems in Northern Ireland. He said: 'I want to see the gun taken out of Irish politics. The gun was brought into our affairs by the British. I want to see the IRA disbanded and the British army disbanded. 'I have had the courage to call on the IRA to take part in a demilitarised Northern Ireland.' Mr Adams is in the US for 48 hours for a conference about Northern Ireland organised by an independent think-tank. His visit was made possible when President Bill Clinton decided to grant him a visa, lifting a 20-year ban. The decision to grant the visa was met with outrage by Ulster unionists who warned that the Sinn Fein leader would exploit the visit for propaganda purposes. But it was given a cautious welcome by Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, who said the visit was acceptable if it helped bring closer the prospect of peace. Mr John Hume, leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party, and representatives of the Alliance party are also expected to attend today's conference in the US. Unionists said the decision meant the US had relinquished any right to act as an intermediary in any efforts to bring peace to the province.   Countries:-  USZ  United States of America.

He is due to meet Mr James Baker, the US secretary of state and main leader of the peace bid, in Cairo tomorrow to review progress on a proposed Middle East peace conference, to be sponsored by Washington and Moscow, that would presage direct bilateral talks between Israel and its Arab foes. Mr Baker was on his way back to the region last night for the fourth time since the Gulf war ended, in what a senior White House official has described as 'one last trip' to see whether there is sufficient support to go ahead with a regional peace conference. This hint of impatience in comments by a senior national security adviser is intended to put pressure on both Israel and Arab countries to make compromises so that such a conference can go ahead. Like Mr Baker, Mr Bessmertnykh expressed the belief that a genuine prospect for peace talks still existed, without offering any indication of progress on the obstacles remaining. 'I have a hope - not yet at the level of full confidence - but I hope that further contacts will make it possible to move forwards to peace negotiations,' he told a press conference. He acknowledged that the key question of who should participate in the negotiations had yet to be resolved. Moscow backs the Arab demand that the UN should play a significant role, something rejected by Israel. Israel also seeks complete exclusion of the Palestine Liberation Organisation and other limits on Palestinian representation. Mr Bessmertnykh did not use his visit - the first to Israel by a Soviet foreign minister - to announce, as Israel had hoped, the restoration of full diplomatic relations, broken off by Moscow during the 1967 Six Dar War. But he said that point was 'very, very close' and adopted a much friendlier tone in talks with Mr Yitzhak Shamir, the Israeli prime minister, and Mr David Levy, the foreign minister, than he had in remarks before his six-hour visit. He made no mention in his public statements of Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, which he had objected to sharply the previous day in Jordan. Asked whether the Soviet Union might restrict Soviet Jewish emigration to Israel as a means of pressuring Israel on the peace process, he replied that both sides had agreed that 'no country will try to put pressure on any other country.' Israeli officials said Mr Bessmertnykh told them emigration would continue.  The Financial Times   London Page 2  "

Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, said: 'We are not insisting on a particular form of words. We just need to have an unequivocal assertion that they intend it should be over for good.' Sir Patrick's remarks appeared to indicate that a response based on republican intentions rather than specific wordings could be sufficient to open the door to exploratory talks with Sinn Fein. Referring to the British and Irish governments' differing interpretations of the IRA statements to date, he said he did not doubt Dublin's sincerity in accepting that the IRA had ended its campaign, but 'we have to be satisfied from what these people say themselves about their own intentions'. Sir Patrick met Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, last night at Hillsborough, the Northern Ireland secretary's official residence. The meeting was an attempt to agree a common response to the ceasefire and to discuss progress on a framework document on new constitutional arrangements for the province, due to be tabled at inter-party talks later this year. After the meeting, Sir Patrick said: 'Both of us share the common hope of seeing . . . a permanent end to violence.' However, the two ministers appeared to be no closer to agreeing on whether the IRA ceasefire was already a permanent cessation of violence. Mr Spring said: 'There is a desire by the republicans to be part of the democratic process . . . I would hope we can move on from here - that there will be no more violence from the republican side in Northern Ireland, and what is expected now is that there will be a reciprocation from the loyalist side.' He added: 'I personally believe that we can overcome any differences that have arisen.' Downing Street officials yesterday played down suggestions that Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein leader, was about to receive permission from the US authorities to make a tour of American cities. Leading Sinn Fein officials confirmed that they were examining the possibility of a visit to the US by Mr Adams and other senior republicans, including Mr Martin McGuinness, a member of Sinn Fein's executive. A Downing Street spokesman said the US government had given no formal indication to London that it was prepared to give visas to Sinn Fein officials. However, the spokesman made clear that Mr John Major, the prime minister, would prefer the US to refrain from granting Mr Adams a visa until Sinn Fein and the IRA had stated that the ceasefire would be permanent. Reacting to Sir Patrick's demands for a statement on republican intentions, Mr Tom Hartley, Sinn Fein's national chairman, complained the British were 'piddling about'. He said: 'The Irish government are taking the process forward. Will the British government not run with it. They're making the problem worse by just prevaricating.' Last night, speculation continued that the Ulster Volunteer Force, one of the main loyalist paramilitary groupings, might call its own ceasefire. Mr Chris Hudson, a Dublin trade union official who held talks with UVF representatives last week, said that among unionists 'there was definitely cautious optimism . . . that they were beginning to feel convinced there was no sell-out, no deals done, no secret agenda'.

Mr Molyneaux yesterday said: 'I already know what's in (the initiative). It is a grandiose scheme calling for the self-determination of the whole of Ireland and designed to go over the heads . . . of the people of Northern Ireland.' The UUP is not demanding to be briefed on the initiative and Mr Molyneaux has no plans for an imminent meeting with Mr Spring. This contradicted reports in the Irish media that Mr Molyneaux was already in Dublin. 'I am flattered to discover that I am the first mortal to appear in two places at once,' he said. 'I have been working a long time to achieve that.' The reports appear to be fuelled by the Irish government's keen interest to talk to the unionist parties. The Department of Foreign Affairs in Dublin said: 'We would very much look forward to a meeting with the unionist leadership if it could be arranged.' Mr Molyneaux did not specifically rule out the possibility of a meeting at a later stage. The Irish government was briefed last week on the Hume-Adams peace initiative by Mr John Hume, leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party. Details are being kept secret for fear that what is now considered a nascent peace process could be halted by publicity before all parties have been given a chance to consider the proposals. Unionist interest in the initiative was indicated earlier this week by the Rev Martin Smyth, Ulster Unionist MP for South Belfast, who said that Sinn Fein would be accepted by the UUP at the negotiating table if there was to be a total cessation of violence. What remains to be clarified are the terms on which the IRA would abandon its 25-year military campaign. Mr Ken Maginnis, UUP deputy leader, said yesterday that an end to violence would require the handing-over of all arms caches by the IRA and other paramilitary groups.

'I hope an opportunity will arise before too long,' King Hussein said after meeting Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, in Washington. 'Its normal when moving toward peace that people meet.' Such a meeting could take place before full peace was established, the king said. His offer breaks with his and other Arab leaders' long-stated policy of refusing to meet Israeli leaders openly. It will put pressure on Palestinians to strike a deal with Israel in talks which remained deadlocked in Cairo yesterday over implementation of Palestinian self-rule in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank area of Jericho. Israel, anxious for increasing Arab recognition abroad and peace dividends at home, has been urging Washington to arrange a summit meeting with King Hussein in return for US assistance with Jordan's external debt. Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, met the king secretly in Jordan last November. Israel says a detailed peace agreement with Jordan was concluded, but the king has been reluctant to sign a formal peace with Israel ahead of Syria and Lebanon. The king's move is likely to stir protest in Jordan, where parliamentarians yesterday condemned a visit by 83 Jewish Rabbis last week and attacked the government for letting them in. But lately he has pushed far ahead of Moslem fundamentalists and others in Jordan who strongly reject peace with Israel and has outlined his vision of an unfolding peace based on regional economic co-operation and trade. The king has made it clear that, while he is still committed to a comprehensive peace, Jordan is no longer willing to wait indefinitely for progress in talks between Israel and other Arab states. 'We are not waiting for anybody but we hope that as things move we will all meet before too long having accomplished our work in establishing a just and lasting peace,' he said. The king's offer will be warmly welcomed in Israel, which has been focusing recent moves on appealing to President Hafez al-Assad of Syria to assure a sceptical Israeli public about Syria's intentions towards the Jewish state. Mr Rabin said yesterday his government 'yearned' to strike a lasting regional peace agreement this year and urged Mr Assad to 'go the extra mile' and assure the Israeli public that Syria had long-term peaceful intentions towards the Jewish state. Speaking in Strasbourg, Mr Rabin urged Syria and other Arab states not to lose precious time and to seek agreement in Washington. 'Israel is ready for peace and willing to take risks and make dramatic decisions .. We are looking for a peace that would last for generations to come - a peace that will put an end to the suffering and fear of all the peoples of the Middle East.' Mr Rabin's remarks came after President Ezer Weizman showered rare praise on the Syrian leader, saying he held the key to peace and was a man of integrity, sincerity and honour. In Cairo, Israeli and Palestinian officials held lengthy talks to try to hammer out an agreed document after weeks of fruitless negotiations focused on control over border crossings. Israeli officials sought to damp hopes that Mr Peres and Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman, would be able to sign an agreement when they meet in Switzerland at the weekend.

The  MPLA information secretary said so during a party visit to  Lubango, the capital of Huila Province.    [Begin recording] [Lourenco] The view is that the talks are  taking much too long and that it is high time a solution is  found to the conflict in this country. We believe that the  Angolan people have reached the limits of their suffering, so  there is every need for the government, the National Union for  the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA], and the international  community in Lusaka to make every effort to ensure that a peace  accord is signed as soon as possible.    [Unidentified correspondent] Do you believe that such an  accord will be the solution to the Angolan conflict?    [Lourenco] I think so. I believe so. It is common to say  that hope is the last thing to go, so we are still keeping alive  the hope that peace will be achieved in Lusaka.    [Correspondent] UNITA has said that the government has asked  for a deadline at the talks so that it can continue its  offensive on the ground. Would you care to comment?    [Lourenco] That is an absurd point of view. If we are asking  for a deadline, it is because we want to achieve peace as soon  as possible. In doing so, we are making it clear that we are  the only ones interested in having the war end immediately and  in achieving peace that will last. [end recording]     "

0,FT941-2971 ,"FT941-2971 _AN-ECRDQAB6FT 940318   FT  18 MAR 94 / US has key role to play in peace, says Adams      By MICHAEL CASSELL, JUREK MARTIN, TIM COONE and DAVID OWEN   The US could play an instrumental role in helping achieve peace in Northern Ireland, Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, said in Belfast yesterday. Mr Adams told a St Patrick's Day rally that the US Administration was displaying readiness to take a fresh approach to the conflict in spite of sustained British pressure. Mr Adams was speaking before yesterday's meeting in the US between Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, and Mr Bill Clinton, the US president. The Sinn Fein leader said republicans wanted to live in peace and without coercion among their unionist neighbours. He said Sinn Fein neither condoned nor encouraged armed actions and stressed that all parties had to be involved in the current peace process. Mr Adams's stance received a guarded welcome in Washington, with Mr Clinton saying he was 'quite encouraged' that the IRA remained interested in the peace process. Mr Adams's words came 'at a good time', and Mr Clinton added: 'I hope it has a good effect.' Standing with Mr Reynolds at a White House ceremony to mark St Patrick's Day, Mr Clinton said it was 'premature' to discuss the question of issuing another US visa to the Sinn Fein leader. He had no regrets about letting Mr Adams into the US last month - 'because we all have to take a chance for peace' - but indicated that much would depend on what Mr Adams's party did next. 'The issue now is what is going to be the role of Sinn Fein in the ongoing peace effort,' he explained. 'Will they join? I hope they will.' Speaking later at a St Patrick's Day dinner hosted by the president, Mr Reynolds said that US support for the Northern Ireland peace process would have 'an important influence' on its outcome.' He said that the Downing Street declaration had created a 'historic opportunity' to resolve the Northern Ireland conflict and had 'removed any possible justification for violence'. He had earlier briefed Mr Clinton on the latest developments in the peace process and he was in turn briefed by Mr Clinton on the recent visit to the US by Mr John Major, the prime minister. In London, Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, was urged strongly by Tory backbenchers to increase pressure on the Irish government to improve security co-operation. Many Conservative backbenchers are anxious for security co-operation to be improved in areas such as intelligence gathering and the cross-border pursuit of terrorist suspects. These matters are understood to have been raised by officers of the Tory backbench Northern Ireland committee in a short meeting with the Northern Ireland secretary after question-time in the House of Commons. Earlier, Sir Patrick told MPs that the recent IRA mortar attacks at Heathrow Airport would not wreck the peace process. He said: 'If Sinn Fein or the Provisional IRA consider that they are going by violence to secure a departure from the declaration or any concession from the British government, they would be better employed taking a running jump at themselves.'

Rabin's remark means Israel no longer needs to ask for such  aid, because this aid has become a routine practice. Successive  U.S. Administrations have never failed to extend aid to Israel.  They are so generous that their aid to Israel exceeds that  extended to any other U.S. ally. This aid has turned Israel  into the largest military arsenal, with the most sophisticated  weapon systems, including nuclear arms and weapons of mass  destruction.    The question asks itself: If Rabin did not go to Washington  to ask for military and financial aid, what did he really want?  It is not difficult for anyone following events to find the  answer in the political situation created by the Ibrahimi  Mosque's massacre in Hebron. This situation halted the  Washington peace talks segment of the peace process and stopped  the continued talks between the Rabin government's delegates and  representatives of the Palestinian side that signed the  Gaza-Jericho agreement.    The massacre in the holy Ibrahimi Mosque covered the peace  process in a flagrant terrorist curtain of blood and fire. It  offered one more proof of the Israeli rulers' policy to foil the  peace process and prevent it from advancing one step forward  after the Madrid conference more than two years ago.    Justifications and hollow words meant to calm emotions could  not save the Rabin government from being held responsible for  this abominable massacre. Thus, Rabin went to Washington facing  a real impasse as a result of his policy to defend the illegal  settlements. These settlements expressed adherence to policies  of regional expansion and altering the geographic and  demographic nature of the Israeli-occupied territories. Israel  wants to impose the illegal presence of these settlements on the  whole world as an accomplished fact.    The Ibrahimi Mosque's massacre has clearly and irrevocably  revealed the true positions of the Rabin government. It has  also revealed that this government is just an alleged dove of  peace, and that it is essentially hostile to peace, just like  all previous Israeli governments.    However, the Rabin government, which deceitfully raised the  slogan of peace with one hand while committing daily crimes and  massacres with the other hand, has reaped evil results and  fallen into the traps it set for the peace process. The  bargaining chips of peace, which this government has used since  it assumed power, have lost their value. Hence, Rabin's visit  to Washington under these circumstances is proof of the deep and  complicated crisis facing his government. It is also proof of  the special relationship between the U.S. Administration and  Israel, and of the extent of this administration's ability to  convince the Israeli rulers of whatever it wishes.    The new political situation -- represented by both the Rabin  government's state of affairs and the power to convince the  Israeli rulers that the U.S. Administration enjoys -- makes the  United States assume an additional great responsibility. This  is because the United States is the superpower that assumes  special responsibility toward both global peace and  international legitimacy, in its capacity as the country that  unleashed the Middle East peace process.    From this premise, the current circumstances seem very  appropriate for the U.S. Administration to play its role in  having Rabin comply with the U.S. peace initiative and announce  his acceptance of the bases of this initiative in order to  achieve a just and comprehensive peace based on the resolutions  of international legitimacy in the region.    No one can deny that the Arabs, led by Syria, contributed to  unleashing and preserving this peace opportunity. Without the  Syrian position in particular, doors would not have been opened  for the peace process, and the peace talks would not have begun  in Madrid and resumed in Washington. This is because Israel  officially rejected the U.S. initiative in writing. Moreover,  Israel has thus far rejected the bases of the peace process.    Syria -- which showed cooperation to render the peace  process  a success and which really wants to achieve a just and  comprehensive peace that will return territories and rights to  their owners and preserve the dignity of all parties -- does not  have any problem with the U.S. Administration. Likewise, the  Arab side, as a whole, does not have any problem with the U.S.  Administration. Syria and other Arab parties hope the U.S.  Administration will manage to revive the peace process before  the latter is finished off by the Israeli Government's policy  and positions that obstruct this process.    The only way to make the U.S. initiative a success and break  the deadlock in the peace talks is the acceptance by the Israeli  rulers of the bases of this process, their respect for  international legitimacy, and their relinquishment of the policy  of regional expansion, racist fanaticism, war crimes, and  annihilation. The U.S. Administration is primarily responsible  for achieving this objective. It is a problem between the U.S.  Administration and Israel, and not between this administration  and the Arabs. The key to resolving this problem is in  Washington's hand.     "

That optimistic tone was possible only because the FMLN delegation, which  included two of the rebel coalition's top guerrilla commanders, made a specific  offer to stop the fighting by early next year if the government agrees to a  series of specific reforms in El Salvador. The rebels said they would agree to  a cease fire on Nov. 15, and to demobilization of their fighting units by Jan.  31, 1990, if the government agrees to a sweeping overhaul of the country's  justice system and military. Rebel spokesmen also offered to transform their  movement into a political party and try to achieve power peacefully, if the  government agreed to advance the date of elections now scheduled for 1991.    But despite the FMLN's peace offer, it would be naive to expect a quick or easy  end to 10 years of bloodshed in El Salvador. Once the peace talks begin, it is  likely they will be long and difficult. Even as the government delegates were  leaving Mexico City on an upbeat note, spokesmen for two groups back in El  Salvador that could easily sabotage the talks were criticizing the FMLN peace  plan.    An official of Cristiani's Arena party dismissed the request for early  elections as ""beyond consideration."" So the first test of the new president's  political clout, a power that many analysts feel is quite limited, will turn on  whether he can persuade his political allies to give peace a chance.    Even more worrisome, a Defense Ministry spokesman said the nation's 60,000-man  army would not be reduced as long as Marxism remains a threat to ""the nation  and the Central American region."" In some extreme cases, El Salvador's military  caste equates Jesuit priests with Marxist subversion. That rather paranoid  notion of national security is grounds for wondering whether the Salvadoran  high command will ever agree to demobilize the manpower and firepower it has  amassed with more than $1 billion worth of U.S. aid. The military was the  single most powerful, and corrupt, institution in El Salvador when the civil  war began in 1979. While it has become somewhat more professional under U.S.  tutelage, it is also more powerful than ever before. No peace plan will work in  El Salvador unless the generals and colonels support it. And they are unlikely  to cooperate unless their North American paymasters insist on it.    The rebels know that.

The elements believe that Jordan will attend the  Washington peace talks, which are due to resume in the coming  weeks.    This week, Israel and Jordan held daily contacts on various  tracks. Elyaqim Rubinstein, head of the Israeli delegation to  the talks with Jordan, had several telephone conversations with  his counterpart Fayiz al-Tarawinah, the chief Jordanian delegate.    In these meetings, Israel sought to learn about the  Jordanian  stand on the naval blockade issue and to gauge the seriousness  of Jordan's threat to suspend the peace talks if its  disagreement with the United States is not resolved.    For their part, the Jordanians evinced great interest in the  progress of the Israeli-PLO economic talks in Paris. They asked  Israel to consider Jordan's positions in various spheres  pertaining to the future economic ties between the Palestinian  autonomy and Jordan. [passage omitted]    On another track, a periodic meeting on current problems was  held at the beginning of this week between Israeli and Jordanian  elements. One of the issues on the agenda was the infiltration  of opponents of the Iraqi regime into Israel through Jordanian  territory.    The track of direct, working-level encounters, which was  established many years ago, gathered substantial momentum after  the Israel-Jordan peace talks were launched. At present, they  are incorporated in the political talks.    Within this framework, a senior Israeli element met with his  Jordanian counterpart in Washington several weeks ago. The two  exchanged views and assessments on the Middle East situation.    Jordan is more prepared than the other peace process  participants to introduce confidence-building measures vis-a-vis  Israel and to maintain ties with it on several tracks.     "

[Al-Hasan] The Jordanian-U.S. summit meeting was successful  in the true sense of the word. His Majesty King Hussayn held  meetings with U.S. President Bill Clinton and the secretaries of  state, defense, and commerce. He held a meeting with the Senate  Foreign Relations Committee and U.S. congressional leaders. In  my opinion, the royal visit achieved its objectives of deepening  bilateral relations. The visit was also a precious opportunity  which came at the appropriate time to discuss the peace process  and ways of promoting it so that it would reach its goals of  achieving a just, comprehensive, and lasting peace in the  region. In addition, the Jordanian-U.S. Joint Committee held  its first meeting, during which it conducted a general review of  the relations in all areas and domains.

[Al-Hasan] Undoubtedly, the talks held within the framework  of the joint committee were thorough. They dealt with several  issues, especially in the economic field. I am confident that  the indications that emerged from these meetings were positive  and reassuring. The meetings that were held within the  framework of the joint committee were fruitful and constructive.  All issues were discussed in depth and in detail. I am sure  these talks will have positive effects in all areas and domains.

The Jordanian  monarch's talks in the United States aimed to push forward these  talks. What was achieved, Mr. Minister?    [Al-Hasan] Regarding the peace process, or regarding the  part of His Majesty King Husayn's visit to the United States  dealing with this process, the royal visit, in my opinion, was  an important stage, coming as it did after the activation of the  formulas for negotiations on the Jordanian track. I am fully  confident that this development will have a positive and  tangible effect on all other tracks. This is because  essentially we all seek a just, lasting, and comprehensive  peace. We also look forward to achieving joint objectives  according to a comprehensive view of the peace track.    [Al-Miliji] Mr. Minister, let us go back to your statement  on the activation of the talks on the Jordanian track. What do  you mean by this phrase? What progress was made on the  Jordanian-Israeli track in the past phase?    [Al-Hasan] Undoubtedly you are aware that the media have  reported extensively on the progress within the framework of the  tripartite U.S.-Jordanian-Israeli Committee. Positive results  were achieved regarding the demarcation of the border, the  issues of land and security, and other issues pertaining to  water and the environment. Accordingly, this progress has had  positive effects on the Jordanian-Israeli track. Therefore,  there should be real progress regarding all these issues, which  are a basic part of the agenda approved by the two sides last  September.    [Al-Miliji] Your Excellency, has an agreement been reached  with Israel concerning the issues of land, security, the  environment, and borders?    [Al-Hasan] An agreement to form a committee has been  reached.  In the past Israel had refused to form a committee on the  demarcation of borders and land. This is an important basic  issue because it concerns Jordan's sovereignty over its land.  Therefore, the direct results produced by the tripartite  committee were represented in the Israeli approval to form this  committee. This has triggered the real progress to which I  referred in my previous answer.    [Al-Miliji] Did King Husayn of Jordan discuss this issue,  the  issue of the land, during his talks in the United States? Did  he also ask the Israeli side for an understanding on this issue?    [Al-Hasan] During His Majesty's meeting with the U.S.  President and other U.S. officials, the talks focused on the  peace process and Jordan's principal role in this process, to  which Jordan is committed with the aim of reaching a just,  comprehensive, and lasting peace in accordance with the  Jordanian national constants. His Majesty the King briefed the  U.S. President and all U.S. officials on Jordan's stand and  concept regarding this process. The U.S. side showed real  understanding for His Majesty the King's explanations of these  issues. The Jordanian stand was received with complete  satisfaction; and the U.S. side made clear statements, praising  Jordan's role and adopting the Jordanian viewpoint concerning  the issues of land, borders, and other things.    [Al-Miliji] Your Excellency, can we say that the coming days  will witness the signing of a peace agreement between Jordan and  Israel?    [Al-Hasan] When all the issues on the agenda--the agenda  which has been agreed upon and ratified by the two sides--are  discussed and when all Jordan's demands pertaining to the issues  of lands, waters, refugees, and other issues that are clearly  listed on the agenda are met, we will undoubtedly reach, as part  of a comprehensive agreement, a comprehensive and just peace  that will be accepted by future generations.    [Al-Miliji] At the end of this dialogue, we convey our  heartfelt thanks to Talal al-Hasan, Jordanian minister of state  for foreign affairs. Your Excellency is always welcome as a  guest on the Voice of the Arabs. Thank you.    [Al-Hasan] You are welcome.     "

He is to meet Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, in Dublin today. However an early resumption of talks is unlikely. Britain and Ireland are expected to first hold two Anglo-Irish conference meetings, under the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement, before a suspension for the talks' duration. Local politicians may also want to wait until after May's local elections in the province. Differences of emphasis between unionist and nationalist leaders emerged at Commons questions yesterday. Mr Seamus Mallon, deputy leader of the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour Party, hinted he wanted the province's links with the Irish republic higher on the agenda. Sir Patrick came under pressure from Unionist MPs for saying in December that he was just a 'facilitator' of talks. Mr Peter Robinson, deputy leader of the Democratic Unionist Party, asked if the Conservative party was still a Unionist party. Sir Patrick replied that so long as a majority of Northern Ireland's population wanted to remain part of the UK it would. 'If, on the other hand, the day should come when the majority should wish some other citizenship then the UK government would not stand in the way of that,' he said.

However he did apparently agree to try and persuade his Serb allies in Bosnia to attend talks in New York early next week on the Vance-Owen peace plan. 'We cannot say whether the peace accord should be adopted in its present form. It is up to the three (Bosnian) communities to decide,' he said after talks with Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, hosted by France's President Francois Mitterrand in Paris. Lord Owen said at a joint press conference with Mr Vance after the first round of talks that it was 'too early to say whether President Milosevic will put pressure on Mr (Radovan) Karadzic (the leader of the Bosnian Serbs).' The mediators rejected a suggestion by the Serbian president that implementation of the peace settlement should start with the application of the military agreement, notably a ceasefire. Mr Milosevic said he thought the Bosnian Serbs would respect a ceasefire. However, Lord Owen said it would be inappropriate for a ceasefire to be implemented separately from a constitutional agreement and the map of the 10 provinces into which it has been proposed that Bosnia should be divided. He said that if a ceasefire came into effect without the other elements, the Bosnian Serbs would hold on to the 70 per cent of Bosnian territory which they presently occupied. The map provides for a division of territory which would give the Bosnian Serbs only 43 per cent. Mr Vance said they had discussed with Mr Milosevic the prospect of more draconian sanctions against Serbia if the Bosnian Serbs blocked the peace plan. The US and Britain have drafted tougher sanctions which they want the Security Council to impose if the Serbs obstruct the negotiations. Mr Milosevic said the time had come for the UN to lift sanctions against Serbia. Lord Owen quoted Mr Mitterrand as telling Mr Milosevic: 'Whatever the rights or wrongs (of sanctions), if there is no settlement, the world will take action.' According to Lord Owen, Mr Milosevic had told them that he had only limited influence over the Bosnian Serbs, but the mediators believe that in fact he has substantial influence over Mr Karadzic. The meeting, hosted at the Elysee Palace, was undermined even before it started by statements by both the Bosnian Moslems and Serbs that they would not endorse the peace plan in its present form. Mr Vance and Lord Owen had hoped to isolate Mr Karadzic. But they were thwarted when President Alija Izetbegovic, the Moslem Bosnian president, said on Wednesday he would not return to the peace talks in New York at the end of this week to sign the mediators' map, as he had previously intimated. Mr Izetbegovic has delayed his return to New York until the middle of next week at the earliest, pending further consultations in Bosnia.   Countries:-  BAZ  Bosnia-Hercegovina, East Europe.

De Leon, who arrived  today in Cartagena de Indias to attend the Fourth Ibero-American  Summit told EFE that ""the discussion of the displaced persons is  being concluded."" This issue was one of the biggest obstacles  in the past two months of talks in Mexico.    In Mexico, the Guatemalan Government and the Guatemalan  National Revolutionary Unity (URNG) discussed a solution for the  resettling of thousands of peasants who have fled the war torn  areas in northern Guatemala since 1960. The return of the  displaced persons was not agreed on during the talks in Mexico  because the government demanded a cease-fire in the area which  the rebels refused to accept if progress was not made in other  areas.    Ramiro de Leon, who was sworn in as president of Guatemala a  year ago following Jorge Serrano's foiled self-inflicted coup,  told EFE that he believes the talks in Norway are ""positive"" and  added that he is waiting for more news on the meeting.    The Oslo meeting was scheduled to discuss the creation of  the  Truth Commission which, as in the Salvadoran case, would  investigate crimes and human rights violations during the  conflict; however, the Guatemalan Government does not want to  advance on this issue until an agreement is reached on the  displaced persons.    The Guatemalan Government and the URNG began peace talks in  1991, but it was not until this year that they reached an  agreement regarding human rights and the drafting of a timetable  for negotiations that should end this year with the signing of a  peace agreement.

Mr John Hume, leader of the nationalist Social Democratic Labour party, speaking on Irish radio yesterday, dismissed as 'gamesmanship' and 'point scoring' unionist insistence that the Irish Republic drop its territorial claim to Northern Ireland, enshrined in its constitution, before any further progress at the talks can be made. The hardline Democratic Unionist party boycotted the Dublin phase of the talks last week, arguing that the Irish government had not shown any flexibility on the issue. The Ulster Unionist party attended the talks but little headway appeared to have been achieved. Mr Hume said the unionist position 'is not facing up to the real problem which is 'how do we live together in this island and how do we respect our differences?''. He added: 'If we were playing the same game, I would be demanding that the British constitution be changed because it is an extremely sectarian constitution. The Queen is the head of the Church of England. Church of England bishops have seats as of right in the House of Lords.' He also ruled out power sharing or majority rule as possible solutions that might emerge from the talks. Mr Hulme said that Northern Ireland 'is not a natural political entity because it was unnaturally drawn, the normal political standards do not work . . . that is a self-evident truth . . . We are not going to give back power to the unionists, full stop.' The Stormont parliament was dissolved in 1972, when direct rule from Westminster was introduced after the breakdown of law and order in the province. The SDLP proposal is for a commission of six people to govern the province, including representation from Dublin and the EC. The unionists have rejected that. The DUP said at the weekend it would abandon the talks entirely after November 16 - the date set for the next Anglo-Irish Conference meeting between the British and Irish governments - if agreement between the four Ulster parties and the two governments could not be reached by then. It would attend talks in Belfast this week only if the Republic's constitutional claim was being dealt with 'seriously'.  The Financial Times   London Page 8  "

The country's chief delegate to the Middle East peace talks said the 'real issue' was Israel's acceptance of United Nations resolutions calling on Israel to withdraw from the occupied territories. Mr Abdel Salam Majali said: 'I cannot see the point of inviting us to go to Jerusalem before we really see constructive success in the negotiations in the proper place in which we have all agreed to go to.' He added: 'Israeli leaders have said this many times but one can see it is just talk.' Jordanian officials said King Hussein would maintain his position of rejecting direct talks with Israel without a settlement on its withdrawal from the West Bank and Gaza strip. Palestinian officials also said they were disappointed by Mr Rabin's offer, but said they hoped that the offer signalled that Israel might prove more flexible during the next round of Middle East peace talks. No immediate reaction was forthcoming from either Lebanon or Syria, but President Hafez al Assad of Syria has also professed the utmost resistance to visiting Israel. The only Arab leader to have made the trip was President Anwar Sadat, the assassinated Egyptian leader, in a gesture which helped forge peace between Cairo and Israel, but which ostracised Egypt from the rest of the Arab world. Senior Palestinian officials in Amman claimed that despite Mr Rabin's offer to seek a breakthrough in the peace process, the Israeli premier was avoiding what they called the 'pre-requisites for peace'. 'Our problem with Rabin is that he wants to sell himself as a peacemaker, but he has to prove himself with deeds, not words,' said one official. He said that Palestinian delegation at the peace talks wished to see Israel first accept in full the Geneva convention, which bans Israel, as an occupying power, from changing the identity of the West Bank and the Gaza strip. The official said that if Mr Rabin wished to be serious about peace he must show 'genuine readiness' to halt all settlements on the West Bank.  The Financial Times   London Page 6  "
0,FT934-10465 ,"FT934-10465 _AN-DKEC2AB3FT 931105   FT  05 NOV 93 / Unionist blow to Sinn Fein      By DAVID OWEN   MR JAMES MOLYNEAUX last night dealt a heavy blow to Sinn Fein's hopes of being brought into the Northern Ireland peace process, while giving an equally big boost to the Anglo-Irish peace initiative. The Ulster Unionist leader said Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, would have to wait until at least five years after agreeing to a permanent cessation of violence before it could be considered for admission into the democratic process. Other criminals were 'not usually considered for parole until they have served five years of their sentence'. Sinn Fein would also have to consent to the handover of IRA weapons and the identification of IRA explosive dumps. Interviewed on the BBC, Mr Molyneaux said it would not be difficult to establish a workable Northern Ireland assembly 'in the fairly short term'. This body would start with 'modest administrative powers', but as the constitutional parties became accustomed to working together 'they would acquire trust and confidence . . . and then who knows where it would end'. In a positive response to the six points set out recently by Mr Dick Spring, Irish foreign minister, Mr Molyneaux said that while some 'clarification' was needed, Dublin was 'moving in the right direction'. Asked whether he had an effective veto over proposals put forward by Mr John Major, the British prime minister, Mr Molyneaux said: 'If quite obviously they were going to suggest that they would transfer Northern Ireland lock stock and barrel within say three years to an Irish Republic, well nobody could expect us to live with that situation.' Under such circumstances, the UUP - on whose nine MPs Mr Major depends to swell his precarious majority - would 'terminate the lifetime of this parliament prematurely'.

Eleven weeks ago, on Dec 15, Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish  Prime Minister, stood shoulder by shoulder with Mr Major outside  No 10 and said there was now an ""historic opportunity"" for  peace. Mr Major said it ""opened the doors"" to those who  abandoned violence.    But Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Provisional IRA has  so far refused to take up their invitation to ""turn the key in  the lock.""    Initially, Mr Major showed considerable irritation with Sinn  Fein's reluctance to respond. Early in January, he branded its  demand for ""clarification"" as a desperate delaying tactic. The  word in Whitehall was that Sinn Fein would have a month to  accept the document or face a tough security clamp-down. That  deadline -- never publicly acknowledged by the Government --  came and went.    The Americans then tried. President Clinton agreed to waive  the ban on Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, entering the  United States last month, because the powerful Irish-American  lobby persuaded him that Mr Adams would use the visit to back  the declaration. Mr Adams, however, milked the visit for  considerable publicity but carefully avoided giving any  commitments.    Attention switched to Sinn Fein's annual conference in  Dublin  last weekend. It was described as a ""watershed"" -- the defining  moment for the republican movement.    Ministers hinted that failure by the conference's delegates  to support the declaration would be seen as tantamount to  rejection -- a clear signal that the IRA and Sinn Fein were not  prepared to abandon violence. But Sinn Fein, while softening  its criticism of the peace initiative, set further conditions  for a suspension of IRA operations.    There are plenty of pessimists in Whitehall and Westminster  ready to say ""I told you so."" They say that Sinn Fein was never  really interested in peace and has used the process to raise its  profile and secure important concessions, including the lifting  of the broadcasting ban in the Republic and the international  media blitz in New York.    The Government has also had to soften its previous firm  stance on refusing to clarify the declaration. Last week, in  the run-up to the Sinn Fein conference, Sir Patrick Mayhew, the  Northern Ireland Secretary, and Mr Hurd, the Foreign Secretary,  made speeches clearly aimed at clarifying the small print of the  document, reaffirming that the British Government would not seek  to impede the ""exercise of self-determination"" -- North and  South.    Mr Major used an article in the Irish News, Northern  Ireland's leading nationalist newspaper, to spell out how Sinn  Fein could enter political talks.    Yet the 11 weeks since the two Prime Ministers stood outside  No. 10 have seen the most intense period of political activity  in Northern Ireland for years. The optimists in Government  argue that Sinn Fein is being gradually drawn into mainstream  politics and is raising expectations of peace which may make it  difficult for the IRA to return to the previous level of  violence.    As always with Ulster politics, any progress is  infuriatingly  slow -- and there is now an acknowledgement that it could take  months -- even years -- before Sinn Fein and the army council of  the IRA are prepared to back the declaration. Both Downing  Street and the Northern Ireland Office stress that it remains on  the table and will not be withdrawn. Even without a positive  Sinn Fein response the joint declaration remains an important  statement of principles agreed by the British and Irish  Governments. ""There never was any time limit. It did not have  a sell-by sticker,"" said one official.    Some politicians most closely involved with Northern Ireland  believe that that a new phase has opened up.    They argue that if events since Dec 15 are judged against  the  broad sweep of the Irish troubles, rather than from a short-term  perspective, there has been considerable movement. The softer  tone of remarks by some leading Sinn Fein figures at their  Dublin conference reflects the party's limited welcome of what  it says is a less confrontational approach from British  ministers. It said it found recent speeches by Sir Patrick and  Mr Hurd ""intriguing.""    At the weekend, the essentially uncompromising line taken  by Mr Adams, was followed by a succession of less hostile  contributions, most notably from Mr Martin McGuinness,  vice-president, and Mr Mitchel McLaughlin Northern Irish  chairman.    Yet the stumbling blocks seem as solid as ever. While Sinn  Fein says it accepts that Protestants cannot be coerced into a  united Ireland, it has not convincingly explained how this  squares with its continuing demand for a British assurance that  Unionists should have no veto.    Though the Irish government considers it has stuck more  firmly to the letter and spirit of the declaration than Mr  Major, it has shown itself increasingly ready to make gestures  intended to bring Sinn Fein into the peace process.    Mr Reynolds has sought to maintain what he recognises is the  crucial backing of his Fianna Fail party's republican  traditionalists by accommodating Sinn Fein's demand for  clarification in spite of London's contrary stand.    His interpretation of the joint statement, including an  assertion that no one, including Unionists, had a veto on  progress, was particularly welcome to Mr Adams and Mr  McGuinness, who have gleefully exploited differences between the  governments.    Republicans were also triumphant when Mr Reynolds's  government lifted the 20-year ban on broadcasters interviewing  Sinn Fein activists and para-militaries a move condemned by  Unionists as ""grovelling to the gunmen.""    The Taoiseach's [Irish prime minister] comment that the  future of terrorist prisoners would be considered in the  negotiations after a permanent end to violence was also seen as  a distinctly unhelpful concession.    Critics of the Dublin approach point out that the promise of  more stringent security should Sinn Fein and the IRA reject the  initiative sits uneasily with the actions of the Dublin court  that last Friday [26 February] refused to extradite Joseph  Magee, accused of murdering an Army sergeant in Derby.

Mr Manuel Camacho, the government peace negotiator in Chiapas, met leaders of the Zapatista movement at a secret location in the Chiapas jungle on Wednesday afternoon. A joint statement pledged to push on with peace efforts, but no date was given for a start to new negotiations. The Zapatistas launched their rebellion on New Year's Day, pressing for land reform, indigenous peoples' rights and more democracy. The government and the Zapatistas last met on March 2, when the government presented a peace offer. The Zapatistas have still not responded formally to it, and temporarily broke off consultations with their supporters on their response after the assassination of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary party's presidential candidate, Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio. In recent weeks tensions in Chiapas have eased as peasants have largely ended land invasions that led to violent confrontation with rich landowners. Mr Ernesto Zedillo, chosen to replace Mr Colosio as the PRI's presidential candidate, was in Chiapas yesterday, and gave unconditional support to the peace process.   Countries:-  MXZ  Mexico.

That might mean rewriting Articles 2 and 3 of the 1937 Irish constitution that lay claim to the six counties of Northern Ireland. The round-table talks - which will make an historic move to Dublin today - will be attended by the British and Irish governments, and three of the four main constitutional parties in Northern Ireland. The hardline Democratic Unionist party said on Friday that it would not be sending a delegation to Dublin, arguing that the Irish government had not shown flexibility on its territorial claim.

The second round of negotiations took place from March 20 to  28 at the Burma Army's Southeast Command Headquarters in  Moulmein, capital of the Mon State in southern Burma.    While the five-member Mon delegation tabled a 14-point  agenda  at the first meeting which ended January 3, both sides  eventually agreed to concentrate first on a ceasefire  arrangement.    The Mon announcement came amid strong speculation that talks  between the New Mon State Party (NMSP) and the Burmese junta,  known as the State Law and Order Restoration Council (Slorc),  had broken down.    The Mon is one of the three remaining ethnic guerilla  movements, which the Slorc has urged to enter peace negotiations.    While the Slorc has already met with the Karenni group, It  has not yet opened talks with them.    The Karenni, the largest armed ethnic group of Karen, have  insisted that ceasefire talks take place outside Burma.    In an interview on Wednesday after their return from  Moulmein, two members of the Mon negotiating team, Nai Tin Aung,  NMSP foreign affairs chief; and Nai Soe Myint, NMSP governor of  Thatun District. said both meetings focused on the military  demarcation line separating territories controlled by Mon forces  and Burmese troops.    They specified five particular areas where the group wants  to  have full control --- the central area of NMSP near Tavoy,  Moulmein, Mergui District, Tavoy District and Thaton District.    The identified territory is home to several hundreds  thousand  ethnic Mon, many of whom support the armed movement.    Although ""different points of view"" over the demarcation  still existed, Nai Tin Aung said he believed the two sides ""can  overcome"" their differences.    ""The ceasefire is linked to demarcation of Slorc and NMSP  troops. We are still dealing with this.    ""So far no agreement has been reached, but slowly we have  made some progress,"" he said.    A date for the next meeting has been fixed. Nai Tin Aung  said his team has to report back to the NMSP central committee  before a new round of talks could be convened.    The Mon team was led by Maj-Gen Htaw Mon, NMSP secretary of  the war commission.    It also included Col Kaw Rot, a member of the war commission  and Nai Lavi Mon, education department chief.    Burmese Commander for Southeastern Command Maj Gen Ket Sein  headed the Burmese delegation to the two peace forums.    Other delegates were Deputy Commander for Southeastern  Command, Col Aung San, Col Kyaw Win, deputy director of the  powerful Directorate of Defence Services Intelligence (DDSI),  Burmese Military Attache to Bangkok, Col Thein Swe; Lt Col Kyaw  Thein of the DDSI; Southeastern Command Chief of Staff, Lt Col  Soe Htay, and Maj Myo Myint, a senior officer of Military  Intelligence in Moulmein.    After the talks were inaugurated on March 20, the meeting  was  suspended while the Mon negotiators took two days to visit  relatives and local Mon, Nai Tin Aung and Nai Soe Myint sald.    ""We explained to them the necessity to enter separate talks  with the Slorc to end the civil war which has been going on for  45 years ...militarily, that is why we entered talks with Slorc  separately,"" Nai Tin Aung said.    He said political turmoil in Burma needed a two-pronged  approach, first to get a military ceasefire with various armed  ethnic forces, and second to settle political problems with the  participation of all parties concerned.    ""But to have peace in Burma, we have to have a political  settlement which must be done collectively by all parties  together,"" he said.    Despite its pledges to adhere to the principle of collective  peace negotiations with the Slorc laid down by the Democratic  Alliance of Burma. [paragraph as published]    It is a loose umbrella organization of a dozen armed ethnic  and dissident Burmese groups, the NMSP central committee agreed  last November to engage in separate talks with the Slorc.    Nai Tin Aung said the Mon decision was in response to  overtures by Burmese junta leader Lt Gen Khin Nyunt and that the  group wanted to ""test his sincerity.""    We considered very deeply his invitation. We think since he  was talking about peace we should accept it.    ""We need to test his sincerity,"" he added.     "

The meeting, which will take place shortly before the scheduled resumption of peace talks between the Bosnian Serbs, Moslems and Croats in New York, was called at the request of the two mediators, Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen. A statement issued by Mr Mitterrand's office said that the purpose of the meeting would be to discuss in what way Serbia could help the peace process in the former Yugoslavia and, in particular, how to persuade the Bosnian Serbs to accept the Vance-Owen peace plan. It is not the first time Mr Milosevic has been called upon to put pressure on Mr Radovan Karadzic, the leader of the Bosnian Serbs, at a difficult moment in the peace process. It was thanks to the Serbian president's arm-twisting in Geneva last January, that Mr Karadzic accepted the first part of the Vance-Owen package, consisting of a constitutional framework for Bosnia. Ever since the talks moved from Geneva to New York at the beginning of February it has appeared probable that the mediators, faced with the intransigence of both the Bosnian Moslems and Serbs, would again call upon President Milosevic at a crucial stage of the talks. With the Moslem president of Bosnia, Mr Alija Izetbegovic, indicating that he might soon sign the map of the 10 semi-autonomous provinces into which Bosnia would be divided, the mediators have clearly decided that the moment for putting pressure on the Bosnian Serbs has arrived. If President Izetbegovic signs the map next week, perhaps after a number of further small modifications, Mr Karadzic would be the only leader not to have endorsed the last outstanding part of the peace package.

Speaking in Britain where he has been on a private visit, King Hussein said negotiators in Washington would sign the 'agenda' to guide detailed negotiations with its neighbour 'if not on Monday, then Tuesday at the most'. The king said agreeing a full peace treaty with Israel would take time, but added: 'Certainly the process leading to resolving all the problems, as they relate to Israel and Jordan - the beginning will be very, very soon.' The Jordanian-Israeli track of the talks in Washington had been the least problematic of the four simultaneously negotiated tracks between Israel and the Palestinians, Lebanon and Syria. Jordan's talks with Israel have centred on the return of two small strips of land and water rights. Amman had essentially been waiting for the Palestinians to reach agreement with Israel. King Hussein, after initial anger at having been bypassed by the PLO in its secret negotiations with Israel, has since publicly backed the accord. Last night he said it was 'a very important landmark. . . I would certainly hope that it will. . . lead to peace in our region.' Neither Syria nor Lebanon have announced any progress in the latest talks in Washington, which ended this week. Both remained impassive yesterday at Israel's recognition of the PLO - Syria particularly is rankled by the PLO's lack of consultation. Damascus restated its demand that the Jewish state must withdraw from all occupied Arab land, while Lebanon rejected an Israeli paper presented to its negotiators at the peace talks in Washington, saying it ignored UN Resolution 425 which demands unconditional Israeli troop withdrawal from south Lebanon.

On the last and toughest leg of his tour of the Middle East, Mr Christopher met Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister; Mr Shimon Peres, foreign minister; Mr Ehud Barak, army chief-of-staff; and the heads of the Israeli delegations to the peace talks, who expressed their similar desire for the peace negotiations to be revived. However, Palestinians insist that all the deportees should be repatriated before the talks resume. Mr Christopher last night met Palestinian leaders. Their spokeswoman, Mrs Hanan Ashrawi, told him she thought it unlikely peace talks would resume under present conditions, despite indications that Israel might be ready to make further concessions on the deportees. Israeli officials said the message they had received from the US secretary of state was that the Arab countries had softened their stance and were willing to return to the negotiating table. This the Arabs would be prepared to do even without the immediate return of all the deportees, although further concessions on Jerusalem's part were expected. Under international pressure, Israel agreed three weeks ago to allow 101 deportees to return and to halve the expulsion terms of the rest to one year. 'Our impression from the meeting is that at least, insofar as the Arab countries are concerned, the deportee issue has not been presented as a condition for resuming the peace process,' said Mr Gad Ben-Ari, the prime minister's spokesman. 'It's an issue for which we will have to find a solution, but it is certainly not a condition for reviving the talks.' During his meeting with Mr Rabin, the US secretary of state was reported to have raised the issue of human rights violations in the occupied territories. He was told by the prime minister that Israel would like to delegate more power to the Palestinians, although not at the expense of its own security. Mr Yossi Beilin, deputy foreign minister, said he understood from Mr Christopher that the US intended to increase its involvement in the Middle East peace talks. However, 'I think the most important message given by the secretary of state is that after his recent tour he sees there is a chance to advance the peace process. As far as we are concerned, this is the best news,' he added.   Countries:-  USZ  United States of America.     ILZ  Israel, Middle East.     XNZ  Middle East.

Our correspondent Milan Sutalo reports  on the talks:    [Sutalo] I feel that all the sides who are involved in this  tragic conflict are now ready to make gigantic steps toward the  cessation of hostilities and that they are ready to pay the  price to restore a permanent peace. This conviction was  expressed by Yasushi Akashi at the beginning of talks with his  hosts, representatives of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna.  Recalling the agreement that was signed in Zagreb by Generals  Roso and Delic envisaging a cease-fire, withdrawal of heavy  weapons, interposition of UNPROFOR, and the organization of a  mixed commission that will be chaired by UNPROFOR, Akashi said  that UNPROFOR was ready to enter this process, but it was  necessary for all involved parties to cooperate. We also need  additional forces, Akashi said.    I think we will get support from the United Nations and its  member countries, but only when they are sure that the  interested parties are ready to make steps toward peace. Akashi  recalled the importance of the talks that are currently being  held in Washington and New York, but also said that efforts  toward peace were necessary to be made at the local level.    After we have alleviated the suffering of Sarajevo, Mostar  should be the next town where the suffering of population ought  to be alleviated. Therefore, I would like to hear what the  Croat side is ready to do in Mostar for the restoration of peace.    From what we could hear at the beginning of the talks, which  were open to public, we can fathom what the purpose of Akashi's  visit to Mostar is. After that, the talks were held behind  closed doors. Here is what Yasushi Akashi and Ivan Bender said  following the talks:    [Begin Akashi recording, in English with superimposed  translation] I have had very useful and productive talks here  with Croat leaders in Mostar and I have received assurances of  their full commitment to peace, I have heard their concerns that  this peace might be too fragile. That is all the more reason,  in my opinion, that we should join forces to make this peace  more durable. We have to start with specific concrete steps  toward a comprehensive peace.

[end recording]    [Sutalo] Asked by a journalist, Yasushi Akashi commented on  the NATO downing of the Serb aircraft.    [Begin Akashi recording] This was a NATO action in  compliance  with the Security Council resolution concerning the no-fly zone.  I spoke with NATO Southern Command this morning which assured  me that they had followed the established procedures. UNPROFOR  was not involved in this action.    I also called Mr. Karadzic who was in Belgrade. He assured  me that it was important for us not to over-dramatize these kind  of incidents.

In the first hints of proposals aimed at kick-starting talks on the province, Sir Patrick also envisaged greater co-operation between political institutions in north and south Ireland. Speaking at Liverpool University, he included energy and transport policies and water management as possible areas for co-operation. Sir Patrick hopes to re-start formal talks with Unionists, nationalists and the Irish government after the province's May 19 local elections. He is drawing up outline proposals as a starting point for talks - ending a near silence by the government on specifics of Northern Ireland policy since the first set of round-table talks three years ago. Sir Patrick balanced Unionist and nationalist aspirations and hinted strongly that he supports a central demand of Ulster Unionist MPs - a Northern Ireland select committee at Westminster. He also ruled out Britain and Ireland having joint political authority in Northern Ireland. The speech underlined the shift in Conservative thinking away from an overtly Unionist stance, towards a 'neutral' role. But his plans may revive Unionist fears that they have more influence to lose than gain from re-entering talks. The Reverend Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionist party, called the proposals 'a framework for the betrayal' of the province. But Mr James Molyneaux, leader of the Ulster Unionist party, said he was encouraged by the speech while Mr John Alderdice, leader of the Alliance party, said the proposals displayed a sense of realism. Sir Patrick said government systems based on simple majority rule 'were not successful before and they would not be sufficiently acceptable now. Such a system in a divided society could simply not be relied on to provide a fair deal for both sides of the community or to command the allegiance of each.' He said the current status of Northern Ireland as part of the UK would not change without the consent of the province's population. But he added: 'Correspondingly, there is no prospect of an agreement precluding a politically united Ireland if, at some future date, the public's view should change.' He added there was a new 'intensity' behind public calls for the resumption of talks.   Countries:-  IEZ  Ireland, EC.     GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P9111 Executive Offices.

Mr Christopher's optimism reflected the rapid pace of the Middle East peace process as Israel and Jordan opened their first talks in the region yesterday, marking the beginning of a week of intense US-Arab-Israeli diplomatic activity. The Israel-Jordan negotiations came as Israeli and Palestinian delegates opened a new round of talks in Cairo and Mr Christopher arrived in the region for meetings with the leaders of Israel, Jordan, Syria and Egypt. Mr Christopher will shuttle among Middle East capitals seeking to further Israeli-Syrian peace process, start talks on economic co-operation and regional integration and prepare for next Monday's summit in Washington between King Hussein of Jordan and Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister. The optimism may prove to be misplaced in a region which has often defied prediction and has been in a state of war for almost half a century. However, Jordanian and Israeli delegates who opened talks in a tent in the Arava desert yesterday said they had had a 'very fruitful' day and expected to announce results today, particulalry on one of the key issues - demarcation of the disputed border. Both sides said there were difficult obstacles to overcome but said they were determined to reach solutions to the other two issues - water resources and security - and finalise them in a treaty of peace. 'The prospects for peace are good,' said Mr Elyakim Rubinstein, head of the Israeli delegation. The bilateral talks conclude tomorrow and the process moves to the Jordanian side of the Dead Sea where Israel, Jordan and the US are to discuss economic projects such as regional tourism, connecting electricity grids and perhaps a transnational oil and gas pipeline. The US, expected to fund many of these projects, is considering paving a road between Israel and Jordan via Eilat. Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, who on Wednesday will become the highest Israeli official ever to visit Jordan publicly, said yesterday: 'The main point is this peace will create unprecedented economic opportunities.' Mr Peres also said Israel and the Palestinians were determined to press ahead with peace efforts despite Sunday's bloody clashes in the Gaza Strip. 'There's always a place for fear and there's always a place for regret but that won't take away the necessity to go forward,' he told Israel radio. The Israeli-Syrian track has been deadlocked for nearly three years over the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights but Israel recently accepted Syrian sovereignty over the area.

In a solemn address to the parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe in Strasbourg, Mr Rabin urged Syria and other Arab states not to lose precious time and to seek bilateral agreements in Washington. 'Israel is ready for peace and willing to take risks and make dramatic decisions but any risk or decision should be well calculated.' Mr Rabin said Israel needed to be sure that Syria genuinely means peace and security. 'We are looking for a peace that would last for generations to come - a peace that will put an end to the suffering and fear of all the peoples of the Middle East.' In an emotional moment, Mr Rabin recalled his days as army chief of staff during the 1967 Six Day War: 'Only one who year after year stands facing thousands and ten of thousands of silent mourners in the cemeteries on our memorial day - only one who has seen worlds destroyed and families devastated - knows just how important is peace to us and also for our neighbours.' However, he also warned Palestinian extremists who reject peace with Israel. 'To them I say: no knife, no stone, no firearm, no bomb, no landmine will stop us. We will continue to strike hard without flinching . . . We strive for peace but we will continue to fight for our right to live in Israel in peace and tranquility.' Mr Rabin accused some European nations of ambivalence towards the Jewish state and urged Europeans to help break the Arab economic boycott of Israel. He said Europe should take a more direct role in Middle East peace talks, adding that Israel did not need Europe's money which should be directed to Palestinians to help consolidate the peace agreement. He also made a surprise offer to allow Libyan leader Muammer Gadaffi to visit Islamic holy sites in Jerusalem. Mr Rabin's remarks came a day after Israel's President Ezer Weizman showered rare praise on the Syrian leader, saying he held the key to Middle East peace and was a man of integrity, sincerity and honour. 'I see the key to further peace in the Middle East in finding a solution to Syria, which obviously depends on President Assad. And I still see Assad as a leader through whom peace can be achieved,' Mr Weizman said during a visit to Turkey. Israeli officials said secret bilateral talks with Syria in Washington have shown signs of progress since Mr Assad said he wanted 'normal' peaceful relations with Israel during a meeting with President Bill Clinton in Geneva earlier this month. As Israel focussed on peace talks with Syria, Israeli and Palestinian officials continued lengthy talks in Cairo to hammer out an agreed document that would break the deadlock on implementation of Palestinian self-rule in the Gaza Strip and West Bank area of Jericho. Israeli officials sought to dampen hopes that Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, and Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman, would sign an agreement when they meet in Switzerland at the weekend.

0,FT944-16026 ,"FT944-16026 _AN-EJPAHABMFT 941015   FT  15 OCT 94 / Molyneaux gambles on lasting peace: So far, the UUP is backing its leader      By JOHN MURRAY BROWN   As the Ulster Unionists, the province's main political party, gather in Carrickfergus today for their annual conference, Protestants and Roman Catholics remain far apart. Both nationalist groups - Sinn Fein and the moderate Social Democratic Labour party - are opposed to any form of 'internal solution', while unionists stick to the principle that no change to the status of Northern Ireland can take place without the agreement of the majority. With the emergence this week of a potential third force in unionist politics, with the disavowal of violence by loyalist paramilitaries, there is a danger that unionism, already riven by bitter dispute between the UUP and the more hardline church-based Democratic Unionists led by Rev Ian Paisley, will be further fragmented. Loyalist paramilitaries would appear to share the view of the UUP leader, Mr James Molyneaux, that 'the union is safe'. The DUP remains more sceptical. Mr Peter Robinson, Mr Paisley's would-be heir, said in the Irish Times yesterday that it was 'folly to rely upon the word of any man, especially one who has publicly lied about Northern Ireland in the past'. Mr Molyneaux, pilloried by hardliners, risks being seen as another politician selling out unionist interests. Ominously, some are comparing his performance with the late Brian Faulkner, unionist leader and Northern Ireland premier, who was forced to resign after criticism of his signature of the Sunningdale Agreement in 1973. Some worry that current negotiations go much further than Sunningdale. Mr Molyneaux has put his political reputation on the line by endorsing a deal being drawn up between London and Dublin which at the very least will seek to increase Dublin's role in the affairs of the province. None the less, even if the policy fails and the violence resumes, observers believe Mr Molyneaux could still emerge with honour for having given peace a chance. Mr Chris McGimpsey, a UUP councillor, said: 'There's no point in us giving concessions to the nationalists in negotiations if we can't deliver our people. We're not going to cross the Faulkner line,' So far, there is no sign of dissent within UUP ranks. Mr Molyneaux has shown himself a skilful party manager, balancing the different shades of opinion, and giving real powers to some of his brighter lieutenants - Mr Ken Maginnis, his security spokesman, or Mr David Trimble, who advises on legal issues. The impression is often that these men, not Mr Molyneaux, are driving policy. Mr Molyneaux's line in backing the UK government is now seen to have been taken up by the political representatives of the loyalist paramilitaries, with Mr David Ervine of the Progressive Unionists saying Protestants had nothing to fear from the framework document which London and Dublin are expected to conclude in the next two months. And unlike Mr Paisley, some in the UUP have acknowledged that if the IRA was to announce a permanent ceasefire, Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, could be drawn into the democratic process. The fringe parties now representing loyalist opinion also concede that they may be in talks with Sinn Fein in the near future. With the loyalist ceasefire, and after this weekend's UUP conference, Mr Major will be in a much better position to assess the unionist mood and judge whether the time is right to start the process of bringing Sinn Fein into talks.

Churkin met at the Russian Embassy with Croatian Serb  leaders  Milan Martic, Slobodan Jarcevic and General Milan Celeketic,  declaring afterwards that they had agreed to peace talks in  Zagreb next Tuesday [22 March].    Martic, however, said he had agreed to attend the meeting on  condition that that the Croatian delegation to the talks be  headed by Croatian President Franjo Tudjman.    The peace talks would mark the first time Serb leaders from  the breakaway Krajina region travel to Zagreb since clashes  between the two sides began in 1991.    The Russian Embassy in Zagreb said Churkin was expected back  in Zagreb Wednesday afternoon to discuss the matter with Tudjman.    Before leaving Belgrade, however, he was scheduled to hold  separate meetings with Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and  Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic.    The Bosnian Serb SRNA news agency said Karadzic had  indicated  he would be willing to discuss a proposed federation plan  linking Croats and Moslems as long as it did not go counter to  Serb interests.    The plan calls for Bosnia's Moslems and Croats to merge  their  territories in a loose Bosnian federation that could eventually  be linked with Croatia.    Attempts to convince the Serbs to join the U.S.-brokered  plan  and end more than two years of bloodshed in Bosnia have so far  proved fruitless.    Churkin, who is Russian President Boris Yeltsin's special  envoy to the former Yugoslavia, and Milosevic met Monday to  discuss possible Serb involvement in the proposed federation's  constitution.    Churkin earlier this week also met Bosnian Serb leaders  Momcilo Krajisnik and Nikola Koljevic.    The Belgrade daily BORBA said the U.S.-brokered federation  plan would be discussed at a meeting here Wednesday involving  Milosevic, Karadzic and Martic.     "

Our correspondent told us that Israel asked  for the postponement for two reasons:    1. To try to hold secret talks with Syria parallel to the  Israeli-Palestinian talks in Oslo. The [London-based] AL-HAYAH  reported this, citing Syrian sources. It said the Israeli  negotiators have asked for secret negotiations, but the Syrians  have been categorically rejecting any secret contacts or any  departure from the course of the negotiations as established in  Madrid and continued in Washington.    2. To take a break to assess the results of Geneva summit  between Presidents Clinton and al-Asad.    These two reasons have been confirmed, as our correspondent  told us in a direct telephone call this morning. He added a  third reason:    [Begin unidentified correspondent recording] The two reasons  have been confirmed, and our radio has learned of a third  Israeli reason for the postponement: Raising the level of  representation at the next round of talks. During their  meeting, Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres asked U.S.  Secretary of State Warren Christopher to try to get the  concerned Arab parties, especially Syria and Lebanon, to raise  the level of negotiations. [end recording]    Our correspondent said that no official date for the  resumption of the 12th round of peace talks has been fixed. The  negotiations will resume on 15 February at the chief delegates'  level.    What did the State Department spokesman say?    [Begin correspondent recording] A State Department spokesman  said that after consultations with the concerned parties, the  cosponsors of the peace process proposed suspension of the peace  talks being conducted at the chief delegate level for a short  time to give the parties enough time to consult with their  governments. The negotiations will resume on 15 February with  the same format--at the chief delegate level.    The truth, however, is that the U.S. announcement is based  on  an Israeli request. Heads of the Arab delegations, therefore,  are dissatisfied. In our conversations with them, the heads of  the Lebanese and Syrian delegations did not show any enthusiasm  for the decision, and they initially decided to stay in  Washington during the hiatus and to contact their governments by  telephone and facsimile.    The U.S. State Department spokesman ruled out the  possibility  that a tour of the Middle East by Secretary of State Warren  Christopher is imminent. [end recording] [passage omitted]     "

In an upbeat inauguration statement, Dr Majali, Jordan's former chief peace negotiator, re-affirmed the Arabs' commitment to the peace process. He said later that Jordan and Israel were very close to agreement and was optimistic about a comprehensive settlement soon. In a statement at the end of the talks, the Arabs criticised Israel's human rights in the occupied territories and called on the US to play a more effective role as a 'full partner' to the negotiations.

Milosevic said in a statement for the press following a two  and a half-hour talk with Russian Foreign Minister Andrey  Kozyrev, who unexpectedly arrived in Belgrade this evening, that  the meeting on Gorazde would be held tomorrow morning and that  the boundaries of the security zone would be determined in  accordance with conclusions reached by a mixed commission  composed of the representatives of the Bosnian Serbs, the  Muslims, and the UN.    Milosevic assessed this evening's talks with Kozyrev as very  open. According to him, the talks were devoted to key issues  pertaining to the crisis in the region, with special emphasis on  the events in Bosnia.    ""I am pleased that we have very close, I would say  identical,  views on many aspects of this question,"" the Serbian president  stressed.    Speaking about the situation in Bosnia, Milosevic said: ""The  peace process in Bosnia is at a critical point, from where it  could very easily escalate into war, but it could also very  easily shift towards a final peace.""    ""We believe that solutions involving small steps and the  extinguishing of small fires is not a solution for Bosnia"",  Milosevic said, and added: ""If things are tackled in this way we  will constantly have a crisis in which only the geographical  name would change, and the war would in this case be difficult  to stop.""    According to Milosevic, the best solution for the Bosnian  conflict would be to reach a comprehensive agreement on the  cessation of all hostilities on the entire territory of Bosnia-  Herzegovina as soon as possible, without prejudging a political  solution, and then to negotiate a final settlement in conditions  of peace.    ""I am very pleased to note that Russian Foreign Minister  Andrey Kozyrev shares our view that the issue of sanctions is  directly linked to the establishment of peace in Bosnia and that  Russia has a very objective and constructive approach in this  regard,"" Milosevic said.    Speaking about Gorazde, Milosevic said that the problem of  that city should be resolved in conformity with the same  principles that govern the global implementation of the project.    ""The Muslim side has avoided defining the border of the  security zone and has from this area launched a big -- as they  called it -- spring offensive. Later a very complicated  situation came about after the collapse of this offensive and  the successful counterattack by Serb forces, but also after the  unfortunate intervention from the air. This has undoubtedly put  back the peace process and to a certain extent compromised the  behavior of UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force].""    Milosevic said that defining the borders of the safe zone  of Gorazde would create the conditions for things to cool off  there, and that this would be the ""extinguishing of a very  difficult and tragic hot spot, but in the context of a general  agreement on a cease-fire throughout Bosnia-Herzegovina.""    ""We will invest all our political influence to see that this  is achieved and we hope that we will are successful in this,""  Milosevic said.    Kozyrev agreed with Milosevic that the talks were very  constructive and said he was leaving Belgrade ""much more  convinced that we shall achieve progress in the peace process.""    Kozyrev underlined in a talk with reporters that President  Milosevic was involved in the efforts to revive the peace talks  and added: ""I am an optimist in this respect.""    Speaking about ways to resolve the Bosnian conflict, Kozyrev  said that the European Union's plan remains on the table and  that the United States, Russia, and the European Union were  endeavoring to achieve peace on the basis of it.    The Russian foreign minister confirmed that there had also  been discussion this evening of the sanctions and said: ""We  considered the question of sanctions, and Ambassador Churkin  prior to this set out the Russian Federation's standpoint on  this. If we are partners in the peace process with the European  Union and the United States, this partnership must be in the  determining of the borders, as well as in relation to the  question of the suspension of sanctions. The Russian standpoint  must be considered both in the European Union and in the United  States. The road to peace is the road to the lifting of  sanctions"".    At the end, Kozyrev advocated that UNPROFOR representatives  be sent to Gorazde and that the blockade of the Blue Helmets  should be lifted ""wherever and however they are being held.""  Thus, he said, the intervention from the air has proved to be  ineffectual.    During this evening's talks, it was assessed that the NATO  air strikes against Serb positions on 10 and 11 April caused an  exacerbation of the situation and brought into question the  efforts to establish a full cessation of hostilities in this  area. In this context, note was made in particular of the  danger of such acts undermining the peace efforts directed  towards the normalization of the situation and the creation of  the necessary conditions for the resumption of the negotiating  process. In this, Russia was directly and actively involved  and, in the assessment of President Milosevic, participated in a  constructive way.    Taking into account that the peace process has found itself  at a point where an escalation of the war and the establishment  of peace were equally possible, Milosevic and Kozyrev agreed  that forces should be joined in order to achive peace. It was  noted that peace was undoubtedly in everybody's interest and  that the only road to the establishment of a final peace in  these regions led through the cessation of all hostilities.    Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic expressed his  conviction  that Russia's peace initiative and the efforts made to implement  an overall cessation of hostilities would prevail over the war  option, and that the United Nations bore the responsibility to  exercise an unbiased approach to all the sides in the conflict.    This evening's talks were also attended by Russian  Ambassador  in Belgrade Gennadiy Shikin.     "

Is Syria happy with the current U.S. stand?    [Salman] The peace process started following former  President  George Bush's March 1991 initiative, which regarded the  implementation of Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338 as  the basis for achieving a just and comprehensive peace in the  region. As one of the two cosponsors of the peace conference  that was held toward the end of that year and of the subsequent  Washington talks, the United States played a major role in  preparing for the Madrid conference through the clarifications  and guarantees it gave and its promises to play the role of an  honest partner in the peace process. The U.S. Administration  remained committed to the Bush initiative when President Clinton  came to power. It has made many statements that it will  continue its efforts to achieve peace on all tracks, especially  after the Washington talks were halted when Israel struck out on  its own with the PLO and concluded the Oslo agreement with it,  completely ignoring the bases on which the Madrid conference was  held. The Geneva summit between Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and  Bill Clinton reiterated the Madrid conference's terms of  reference and the U.S. commitment to continue its efforts for a  comprehensive peace on all the tracks of the conflict. Thus,  Washington is still intent on its commitment to the peace  process, though the role it is now expected to play fails to  live up to its pledge to play the role of a full and honest  partner in the peace process. We believe that, in light of its  special relations with Israel--which have reached the level of a  strategic alliance--the U.S. Administration is capable of  influencing the Israeli stand, which is impeding the U.S.  initiative entailing the implementation of Security Council  Resolutions 242 and 338 and the exchange of land for peace.    [Al-Sa'id] In view of U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher's tour of the region, what is the United States  specifically asked to do as a sponsor of the peace process and  as an honest mediator?    [Salman] What is required is very clear, namely to fulfill  its pledges and commitments to implement its initiative and  effectively fulfill the role of a full and honest partner. This  does not mean exerting pressure on Israel, as some circles are  narrowly trying to interpret this issue, but rather to not leave  international legitimacy's resolutions suspended in mid-air or  subject to Israeli blackmail and bargaining. Israel uses these  tactics in order to avoid the UN resolutions and replace them  with new secret channels, on the Oslo model, so as to deal on  its own with this or that Arab country and thereby conclude  unilateral deals that thwart a just and comprehensive peace.    We hope that Christopher's visit will bring positive signs  that the United States will act in conformity with its  statements on activating the peace process and breaking the  deadlock in the Washington talks, which was reached as a result  of Israeli procrastination and intransigence.    [Al-Sa'id] The rounds of talks have so far proved that  Israel is not serious about establishing peace and that it will  continue its procrastination in order to keep the land as long  as possible. How is it possible to eliminate the obstacles  facing the peace process?    [Salman] This could be done if Israel acknowledges the  inadmissibility of taking other people's land by force and  accepts the land for peace principle. To do this, Israel must  end its continuing occupation of the land and its rejection of  Arab rights. Israel must also stop the its deceptive maneuvers  on international level to disavow the requirements for peace.    The Arabs' steadfastness in the peace battle; the  international community's awareness of the dangers inherent in  the obstruction of the peace process; the unbiased and full  partnership in the peace conference's sponsors, particularly the  United States; and the new reality imposed by the intifadah on  the Israeli occupiers that geographical factors cannot assure  security--it goes without saying that these are all factors in  forcing Israel to abandon its policy that is hostile to peace  and the international legitimacy and for placing the  comprehensive peace process on the right path.    [Al-Sa'id] Israel is convinced that the United States will  not pressure it over talks with Syria due to Israel's internal  situation and their coalition status. Can you comment?    [Salman] This issue concerns U.S.-Israeli relations and the  U.S. desire to maintain the credibility of its commitment to  achieve a just and lasting peace in the region. We know well  the strength of the U.S.-Israeli alliance. But this does not  necessarily mean that the United States is unable to pursue a  policy that serves its special interests or to entertain a peace  plan that is not in line with Israel's, particularly since the  United States is talking about a new world order based on the UN  Charter and resolutions. We should note with guarded optimism  how former President Eisenhower forced Israel to withdraw from  Sinai following the tripartite aggression against Egypt in 1956.    [Al-Sa'id] Do you expect a full or partial Israeli  withdrawal  from the Golan?    [Salman] The withdrawal from the Golan must be complete. We  hope that Rabin's remarks on withdrawal from the Golan are free  of any ambiguity, such as we have been confronting at every  session of talks on the principle of complete withdrawal from  the occupied territories in return for peace.    [Al-Sa'id] Israel claims that Syria is hedging its bets.  On the one hand, it keeps peace exchanges going with Israel,  while on the other, it uses Hizballah as a bargaining chip. How  do you see this?    [Salman] Our policy is not influenced by Israeli  interpretations. The moment we endorsed the U.S. initiative we  made it clear that peace is a strategic goal for Syria and the  Arab world. To achieve this goal, we should employ our  resources in the battle for peace. Therefore, we should adhere  to our pan-Arab principles and support acts of legitimate  resistance. The UN Charter endorses the right of nations to  resist occupation.    [Al-Sa'id] The Gaza-Jericho agreement led to a halt in  negotiations on other tracks and to a discontinuation of the  peace process. What can you say about that?    [Salman] That agreement was an attempt to deprive the peace  process of its foundation, namely, the two UN Security Council  resolutions [242 and 338]. Yitzhaq Rabin admitted as much when  he said: ""The Oslo agreement proved the futility of the  Washington talks."" Rabin urged secret talks as a way of  reaching separate agreements with other Arab parties to the  peace process. By doing so, Israel hopes to renege on all  commitment to the UN Security Council resolutions.    But Rabin failed to achieve this, despite Israel's  intentional obstruction of the Washington talks, which stumbled  as a result. The Geneva summit ended the premature elation that  accompanied the signing of the Oslo agreement. That summit  confirmed that a comprehensive solution must be found on all the  negotiating tracks.    [Al-Sa'id] Arab world splits are a nightmare that weakens  the  Arab negotiating position vis-a-vis Israel.    [Salman] Since the corrective movement [al-Asad's rise to  power] in 1970, Syria has endeavored to cement Arab solidarity.  President Hafiz al-Asad has said that: ""The strength of the  Arabs is in their unity."" President al-Asad warned us not to  worrying about secondary issues and forget crucial Arab matters.    There are cracks in the Arab armor, but these can be sealed.  We will do everything within our power to restore Arab  solidarity. Those who fail to learn the lessons of the recent  past have much to lose, and we are afraid the loss will be  bigger this time.    As for those who remain firm and faithful in word and deed  to  the will of the nation, they discern through the clouds of  discord the need for strict adherence to pan-Arab principles and  further commitment to the interests of future generations.

Israel presented a new paper in its talks with Syria, re-formulating what its negotiators called the 'eternal trinity of peace, security and territory'. It was unclear, however, whether the new Israel proposal would meet the Syrian demand for 'total withdrawal' from occupied Arab lands, including the Golan Heights taken from Syria in 1967. Israeli officials would not go into the details of their proposals but indicated they understood that a full peace settlement, including mutual recognition and provisions for maintaining secure borders, would have to include a territorial element. The seventh round of talks has been clouded by doubts over the re-election of US President George Bush, whose chief of staff, Mr James Baker, launched the Middle East peace process. Some Arab delegates, in particular, have speculated whether Governor Bill Clinton, the Democratic presidential candidate, would be as committed to the process. Also, Palestinian negotiators have warned that their credibility as spokesmen for their people is running out. Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, is similarly under pressure to produce results. The US election being less than two weeks away, however, few observers expect an immediate breakthrough in either the Israeli-Syrian or the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations.

No reasons were given for his departure other than that, according to a company statement, he intends to pursue 'other business interests'. Mr Neil McCann, the group chairman, acknowledged Mr Callaghan's contribution to the company saying that his management team had successfully handled the group's transition to the EC single market. Fyffes is a significant banana importer into the UK and Ireland, and under a new EC quota system which was approved last July, now stands to benefit in the wider EC market at the expense of the top 'dollar' producers such as Chiquita, Dole and Del Monte. Fyffes has, however, suffered a number of setbacks in the past two years in its efforts to build a distribution base outside of the British Isles. Having raised IPounds 60m in a rights issue in 1991, the group made a bid for the Del Monte group, which was then in the hands of the Polly Peck liquidator. A Mexican group, however, made the successful bid at a price believed to be around Dollars 500m. A IPounds 52m deal to buy a significant stake in the Swedish fruit distribution group, Saba, was then aborted in the autumn of last year as the ERM currency crisis caused interest rates to soar in both the Swedish and Irish markets. Earlier this year talks were held between Fyffes and Dole, on a possible agreed takeover by Dole of the Irish-controlled group. It is thought that the terms offered were not acceptable to controlling interests within the Fyffes group, however, and Dole subsequently withdrew. Reports in Dublin at the weekend suggested that it was tensions between Mr McCann and Mr Callaghan over control of the company and how to spend its IPounds 100m cash hoard, that have led to Mr Callaghan's departure. Company sources have been unavailable for comment. Mr Callaghan joined Fyffes from the accountancy firm KPMG Stokes Kennedy Crowley, where he had been a managing partner for eight years.

In a telephone interview conducted by  AL-DUSTUR, Dr. al-Tarawinah said: We will not concede any of our  rights. We want to make progress and achieve a qualitative step  forward in the talks in accordance with the agenda and the point  of reference for the peace process. The principles and  constants will remain unchanged, and we will continue to adhere  to the principle of comprehensive solution.    Dr. al-Tarawinah, who is also Jordan's ambassador in  Washington, noted that the achievement of or failure to achieve  progress in these talks depends on what the Israeli side will  present, particularly since the Jordanian stands are declared  and firm and we have Jordanian and Arab rights to which we  adhere.    The chief Jordanian delegate added: Jordan's stand vis-a-vis  the bilateral and multilateral talks has always been clear and  candid. We reduced the Jordanian participation in the peace  talks and our condition to return to the talks was to lift the  siege of al-'Aqabah. Now that this issue has ended and the  American side has announced its agreement on the Jordanian  proposals to this effect -- except for some administrative and  formal problems -- nothing now prevents the participation in and  return to these talks, especially since Jordan has not suspended  its participation in the multilateral talks but set conditions  for its return.    Dr. al-Tarawinah noted that the return to the  Jordanian-Israeli bilateral talks is also based on Jordan's  adherence to and linkage with the concept of comprehensive  solution, particularly since this includes comprehensive  Jordanian and Arab rights. Jordan has its own issues and rights  and now it is time to move toward the Jordanian facts,  constants, and pillars. These Jordanian rights are part of the  Arab rights and issues.    The joint tripartite committee, which will hold its first  meeting today, 6 June, comes after the last round [of bilateral  talks] which was held last February. The Jordanian delegation,  which is led Dr. al-Tarawinah, also includes Michel Marto,  deputy of the Central Bank of Jordan; Dr. Safwan Tuqan,  secretary general of the Planning Ministry; and Dr. Mundher  Haddadin, chief of the Jordanian delegation to the water  committee in the multilateral talks.

After a meeting hosted by President Francois Mitterrand of France, followed by a dinner at the French Foreign Ministry, Lord Owen and Mr Vance expressed their habitual public optimism that the peace talks in New York were about to enter a more positive phase. It had been a good meeting and 'some progress' was made, they said. However, apart from extracting a promise from Mr Milosevic that he would do his best to persuade the Bosnian Serb leader, Mr Radovan Karadzic, to attend the peace talks in New York next week, the mediators do not appear to have won any concrete commitments from the Serbian president. Indeed, he stressed after the first meeting with the mediators and Mr Mitterrand that he had no direct part to play in the peace negotiations. It was up to the warring parties to work out an agreement on the controversial map dividing Bosnia into 10 provinces. Mr Milosevic's attempt to stand aside from the peace negotiations was not at all to the taste of the mediators, who had engineered the Paris meeting with the express objective of persuading Mr Milosevic to put pressure on Mr Karadzic. Mr Mitterrand brandished both the carrot and the stick in his approach to the Serbian president. Though he gave a magisterial outline of Serbia's historical role in Europe, this was offset by his clear warning that, whatever the rights and wrongs of the situation in Bosnia, the international community was determined to take action against Belgrade (in the form of tighter sanctions) if the Serbs did nothing to help end the conflict in Bosnia. Mr Vance and Lord Owen have returned to New York breathing confidence that their negotiations will resume next week, but on past experience, they cannot be sure that either Mr Karadzic or Mr Alija Izetbegovic, the Moslem Bosnian president, will turn up. However, even if both attend the talks in New York, unless Mr Milosevic is prepared to play the ace that he undoubtedly holds, the prospects for peace must still be gloomy.

He was met by Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' at  Damascus International Airport.    Christopher came 4 hours later than what was scheduled and  the American Embassy here did not explain the reason.    He is going to hold talks with Syrian President Hafiz  al-Asad  and hand him the Israeli peace plan on returning the Golan  Heights to Syria. Israel seized the Golan in the 1967 Middle  East war.    According to a statement issued Friday [29 April] by Israeli  Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, the Israeli plan includes Israeli  perspective on phased withdrawal from the plateau and  normalization of relations between the two countries.    Christopher stated in Israel Friday that he is going to hold  important talks here to revive the Syrian-Israeli talks.    He said that the aim the U.S. tries to reach is establishing  a just and comprehensive peace in the region, something which  necessitates enhancing the talks on the Syrian-Israeli track.    During his current Mideast tour, Christopher has already  visited Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Israel.     "

The idea of separate deals and secret talks still  dominates Israeli thinking. Israel's talk about the  comprehensiveness of negotiations is empty and meaningless.  This being the situation, it takes us back to the same old  question: What does resuming or not resuming the bilateral  talks this month, or next month, or even after that, mean as  long as nothing has changed in the Israeli way of thinking?  Perhaps, counting on the U.S. stand to influence the Israeli  position is not really in harmony with the current state of  affairs. This is because Washington behaves toward the peace  process from the position of someone influenced by the Israeli  stand and not someone who influences that stand. For Israel,  this is not new. However, what is new is that nothing has  changed in the U.S. position, just as Israel and its strong  lobbies in the United States have always wanted it. They want  the United States to take Israel's side, not even allowing to  play a neutral role. Neutrality, a balanced position, and the  role of an honest broker are all unacceptable to Israel, because  it cannot tolerate seeing Washington in a position that is not  fully biased toward it, taking into consideration that it relies  on the U.S. support for its aggressions against Arab land and  rights. Throughout the Arab dealings with the U.S. peace  initiative, it has become clear that every time there has been a  difference between the U.S. position and the Israel position  over the peace process, even though it may have been for  considerable reasons in favor of Washington's position and in  the interest of the peace process, the U.S. position did not  take long to move back into line with the Tel Aviv rulers'  position, even though it may have led to a setback in peace  efforts.    Israel's game has been exposed. It is obvious that what it  wants is to impose an Israeli peace through separate deals with  each Arab party. It wants a peace that would allow it to  maintain its military, security, economic, and political  supremacy in order to eventually have a free hand to control  this region after the establishment of this so-called peace.  However, the question is really whether or not Washington is  still committed to the role of an honest and neutral partner in  the peace process. This question should be posed in light of  Washington's pressure on the various Arab parties, through  various means, forms, methods, and names, which all serve the  Israeli position. What is really required of the United States  is that it prove its honesty by pressuring the party that is  obstructing the achievement of a just and comprehensive peace in  the region; namely, Israel. The importance of an answer to this  question lies in the possibilities of the Arab parties returning  to the Washington bilateral talks and the negotiating table at  the end of this month. Will U.S. efforts actually include the  signs of honesty that have long been awaited by the Arabs, or  will the U.S. position continue to swing back and forth within  the circle of Israeli influence?

It outlines the delegation's further  activities in the course of future peace negotiations on Bosnia,  in a situation where the Bosnian Muslims have rejected the  European Union [EU] plan.    The five-point document states that the RS assembly has  withdrawn the territorial concessions it initially offered  because the Muslims have rejected the EU action plan as a  formula for resolving the crisis, according to which they would  get 33.3 percent of Bosnia-Herzegovina's territory.    In the continuation of the peace process the RS delegation,  the platform points out, will proceed from the real state of  affairs -- on the basis of the EU plan -- and the concept of a  union of three republics in ex-Bosnia-Herzegovina.    The RS is a sovereign and independent state constituted in  line with the universal right of a people to self-determination  and it reserves the right to enter unions with other states.  According to the published platform, the capital of the RS is  Serbian Sarajevo (new Sarajevo). A separate peace agreement for  the Sarajevo area, as envisaged under the peace plan, should be  promptly signed in order to facilitate the talks on placing the  city under UN administration.    The RS borders, the platform says, will correspond to the  factual situation on the ground, and also the RS would have an  outlet to the Adriatic Sea (according to international law - the  Corfu Declaration [1917], the Saint-Germain Charter [1919], and  other international treaties), while some territories can be  considered to be disputed and under a special regime.    The borders between the Serb and Muslim states can, for the  purpose of creating unified territories, be established by  political dialogue, taking communications and other factors into  consideration, and in this way a solution to the disputed  territories might be found in a peaceful way.    The borders between the Serb and Croat states in the former  Bosnia-Herzegovina will be defined in the framework of a  comprehensive Serb-Croat solution.    The RS delegation proposes that the three warring sides  immediately sign a peace agreement and enable a modus vivendi in  the expectation of a final solution.    The RS will, the platform says further, continue to take  part  in the peace negotiations on the basis of the EU plans, but it  requests equal treatment in the negotiations. This means the  abolition or suspension of the sanctions and the cessation of  all threats against the Serbs.    Finally, any violation of the integrity of the RS will be  considered as an act of aggression, the platform unveiled by the  RS delegation at the peace talks says.     "

By DANIEL WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER      JERUSALEM      In a letter made public Friday at a conference of Jewish peace activists, the  chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, Yasser Arafat, endorsed an  active role for Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza Strip in peace talks  with Israel.    The statement was the first direct indication from Arafat that he accepts the  offer of such talks and that Arabs in the occupied lands would take the lead in  them. Egypt, which has been working with the United States and Israel toward  setting up Israeli-Palestinian talks, had been pressuring the PLO to give West  Bank and Gaza leaders a prime role.    In his letter, Arafat said that Palestinians in exile also would take part, a  proposal that Israel rejects.    ""The PLO once more leaned over backward and approved the idea of a dialogue  between representatives of the Israeli government and representatives of the  Palestinian people in the occupied territories and the Diaspora,"" the letter  said.    Arafat demanded that the talks be aimed at reaching a ""comprehensive and final  settlement"" of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict based on an election proposal  put forth by Israel, as well as ideas endorsed by Egypt that include a  withdrawal by Israel from territory occupied in the 1967 Arab-Israeli War.    He insisted that the participation of local Palestinian leaders did not mean  the demise of PLO influence. He suggested that Palestinians will accept only a  settlement endorsed by the PLO. For the Palestinians, he wrote, ""the only  guarantee of their own security and their political future lies in the full  participation of the PLO in all stages of the peace process.""    It is expected that if Palestinians from abroad take part, they would be the  most direct conduits for PLO authority.    Nonetheless, the letter from Arafat appears to accept an offstage role by the  PLO at least in initial stages of talks. This willingness may put pressure on  Israel to accept an invitation from Secretary of State James A. Baker III to  hold preliminary talks on the formation of a Palestinian peace panel. Baker  wants to convene a meeting with the foreign ministers of Israel and Egypt to  work out a list of Palestinian delegates.    Arafat's letter provided a surprise finale to a three-day international  conference on peace sponsored by the Tel Aviv-based International Center for  Peace in the Middle East.    Rita Hauser, a peace activist from New York, told reporters that the letter was  received Thursday by telefax from Tunisia, where the PLO is based. She said it  was kept secret until Friday because organizers of the conference were unable  to ""get it fitted in"" the conference's agenda.    However, other sources at the conference said that organizers had worked for  weeks to get such a letter sent. They had backed off at the last minute out of  concern for appearing to interfere in sensitive diplomatic affairs. But the  letter, dated Feb. 17, arrived anyway and the organizers had no other recourse  but to make it public.    In 1988, Hauser played a role in persuading Arafat to make pledges to renounce  terrorism and recognize Israel's right to exist. The pledges, made by Arafat in  Geneva, led to the opening of a dialogue between the United States and the PLO.    A spokesman for Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said today, ""The government is  not interested in the PLO's position in peace talks.""    Israeli politics are convulsed over the issue of whether to enter peace talks.  Shamir's Likud Party is badly split over the prospects. Many of its members  feel that negotiations will inevitably lead to the loss of the West Bank and  Gaza, which the rightist Likud views as part and parcel of Israel.    In an interview published Friday in the Jerusalem Post, Shamir rejected any PLO  role.    ""The only thing (the PLO) should do is dismantle itself,"" Shamir said, ""because  its minimal demand is a Palestinian state, and a Palestinian state cannot  coexist with Israel.""    The center-left Labor Party, which is the other pillar holding up Israel's  coalition government, has set a two-week deadline for movement on negotiations.  Party leaders have threatened to pull out of the government, a move that will  lead either to a new coalition headed by Labor or Likud, or a general election.    The talks also hold risks for Arafat.

The British Government, in order to divert public attention  from its failure to settle the Northern Ireland issue, does not  refuse to engage in any trick and propaganda artifice in and  outside Britain.    A glance at the past history of clashes in Ireland has  symptoms of the defeat of British policies, both military and  political, in this region and the continuous notoriety earned by  responsible persons in England.    The shooting of any person suspected of terrorist operations  is one sample of these policies. Perhaps the most conspicuous  sample of British policy was the killing of three Irishmen  suspected of membership in IRA in Gibraltar by British security  forces in 1988.    After killing them, the British police found out that the  three Irishmen were not busy laying bombs as suspected but in  fact had no weapons with themselves.    The accident caused the families of the three murdered  persons to file a complaint at European courts against the  British Government for trampling on the second paragraph of the  human rights convention of Europe.    The British Government does not have a good record at the  European courts and since 1950, of the 52 files presented  against Britain, the country has been condemned in 30 cases.    On the other hand in the opinion of many non-aligned  observers the government of Britain has itself been one of the  main causes of political chaos and violent actions in Northern  Ireland. The secret researches performed by the government have  also proved this true.    For example, the daily 'INDEPENDENT' last June disclosed  certain aspects of these secret researches which portrayed the  depth of discrimination against those Catholics of Northern  Ireland who want independence from British colonialism.    On the basis of this report London's political-military  control of Northern Ireland, has over the past 20 years led to  gross inequality and the strengthening of the Protestants who  support prolongation of British rule.    Statistical comparison between the two societies of Northern  Ireland indicate high level of unemployment among Catholics at a  rate that is twice as much as Protestants, in addition to  striking differences in housing, hygiene, and education among  the two groups.    In the opinion of the writers of this report, this is the  direct result of the deliberate policies of London for enacting  discrimination against those who want an end to its presence in  the northern part of Ireland.    On the other hand despite the claims of the British  Government for stopping clashes and armed encounters among the  two groups in Northern Ireland, the statistics of those killed  in these incidents indicate another bitter truth.    Statistics show that for the past seven years until 1993  about 220 Protestants were killed by the republicans. This is  while over the same period 368 republican Catholics were killed  by armed groups who are advocates of English rule.    The British Government while showing itself inclined to  peace  to end the bloody clashes in Ireland has in fact, on many an  occasion entered into coalition with rightist parties that are  opposed to negotiations with the Catholics, and has considered  many concessions for the Protestants in controlling Northern  Ireland.    For instance, British Prime Minister John Major late last  summer, in order to benefit from the support of the extremist  Irish Protestant parties in the parliament and specifically the  Ulster Unionists Workers Party, granted them many privileges  including the establishment of a special selection committee in  parliament.    This issue at that time caused independent observers to  raise  objections and voice concern over the grave results of this  political give-and-take and the probable invalidity of the  present political agreements between England and the Republic of  Ireland in connection with the future of Northern Ireland.    According to observers consider the only probable way for  creating a stable peace in Northern Ireland is for the British  Government to stop its discriminative policies against Catholics  and participate in direct negotiations to be attended by all  sides involved [sentence as received].    London for various reasons has thus far evaded this issue  and  occasionally by bringing up diversions and imaginary claims has  tried to mislead public opinion in and outside the country  especially among the powerful Irish community in the United  States.    Last year, too, an independent committee for investigating  the problem of Northern Ireland named UPSAL had said that any  peace agreement in relation to Northern Ireland without  considering the Catholics and Protestants as equals and with  equal rights for declaring their positions was doomed to fail.

Mr John Major and Mr Albert Reynolds met at Chequers yesterday, accompanied by Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, and Mr Dick Spring, Irish foreign minister After the meeting, the two prime ministers said they had made 'steady progress' in the framework document intended to promote talks involving Ulster's main constitutional parties. But the two men acknowledged that sticking-points remained and declined to set a date for the document's completion. 'There are still some very important issues that remain to be resolved,' Mr Major said. Mr Reynolds said: 'You can take it that the gap (between the two sides) is narrower after today's meeting than it was yesterday.' Officials will continue talks today on what Mr Major described as the 'logistics and mechanics' of arranging for weapons in the hands of paramilitaries to be handed over. Acknowledging that there were 'self-evident difficulties' in the process, partly because weapons were hidden in Ulster and the Irish Republic, Mr Major said: 'Clearly it is desirable to have a co-ordinated approach.' He declined to say whether the handing over of weapons was likely to begin in advance of talks between the government and Sinn Fein before the end of the year. The IRA has not yet agreed to hand over any weapons. Questioned on his remarks last week, which appeared to irritate Dublin, that plans for an Ulster assembly were separate from the framework document, Mr Major said it would be a 'misreading' to suggest he was trying to detach one from the other. The process is seen as falling into three 'strands'. One covers the assembly; strand two concerns north and south relations; and strand three covers relations between London and Dublin. Mr Major said on Friday that the framework document would cover strands two and three. Mr Reynolds declined to say whether he would push for changes in the Irish constitution, which enshrines Dublin's territorial claim to Ulster. Mr Major is thought to have told his Irish counterpart that hopes for a settlement depended on a revision of this claim. Moderate unionists, whose support is vital to efforts to forge a settlement, are expected to insist on such a move. Ulster spending plea, Page 9   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

0,FT941-2656 ,"FT941-2656 _AN-ECTARAB5FT 940319   FT  19 MAR 94 / Weary, wiser, but the fight goes on / Testing the depth of the IRA's commitment to its campaign of violence and asks when it might end      By MICHAEL CASSELL   As former IRA volunteers, Shane O'Doherty and Tommy McKearney were ready to kill for their cause and were incarcerated for their crimes. Now, they are united in wanting an end to armed struggle but ada mant that the British and Irish governments' Christmas peace initiative will not deliver it. Both men, each leavened by long spells in jail, are thoughtful, articulate and confound the caricature of block-headed warmongers painted by their opponents. Though they have left the IRA, their republican sympathies and some of their contacts survive. They dismiss as fanciful suggestions that 200 years of physical force against British 'occupation' is about to end. Neither believes the political initiative launched by London and Dublin  - in spite of high expectations of a historic breakthrough and the peace overtures of republican party Sinn Fein - has shifted the mindset of a paramilitary organisation hell-bent on a united Ireland. Mr O'Doherty was the IRA's chief bomb maker in Londonderry in the early 1970s before mounting a letter bomb campaign in 1973. His one-man war maimed and injured 12 people - Mr Reginald Maudling, then home secretary among them. Though he killed nobody he knew he might. He received 30 life sentences at the Old Bailey in 1976 and was freed in 1989. He is now, at 39, a pacifist, and has accused the IRA of dishonour and cowardice. Last year, he completed an English degree at Dublin University and lives in the city, regularly returning to the north to see his mother. He deeply regrets a past which provides him with a special insight into the present state of mind of hard-line republicans and into what might lie ahead. 'It was clear from the day it was published that the Downing Street declaration was going nowhere.' The declaration, signed by Mr John Major and Irish prime minister Mr Albert Reynolds, tried to square the aspirations of Northern Ireland's two main communities by offering rights of self-determination but guaranteeing Unionists that Northern Ireland would remain part ot the UK as long as they wished. 'We've put sticking plasters over Irish politics for centuries and once again the fundamental issues are being ducked. You cannot have two governments without proper constituencies in the north dictating solutions to a hardened, embittered double minority,' says Mr O'Doherty. So why should the IRA be able to? He concedes some IRA men have now reluctantly concluded - heresy until recently - that there will eventually have to be talks with the enemy. 'But many others still don't see the British deserving talks, they see them deserving bombs, no-warning bombs.' The impact of recent attacks on the mainland suggests, 'the probability is that a greater part of the campaign will move to Britain'. Mr McKearney, whose three brothers have died in terrorist violence, is no more optimistic about an end to IRA violence. He came out of jail in 1993 after serving 15 years for the murder of a part-time soldier in the Ulster Defence Regiment, part of the UK army. Now he is home again, living with his welcoming, elderly parents in a neat bungalow on a hillside in South Tyrone. He says the Downing Street declaration - the very title calculated, he says, to make republicans wince  -has altered nothing. 'This is not a sea-change. This is exactly where we were before. It is the status quo and I resent both governments suggesting anyone who rejects it must be some form of lunatic.' He adds: 'The Downing Street document was a fait accompli guaranteeing the union for ever and a day. Forty per cent of those in the north are annexed into a state against their will and don't want a UK connection while 50 per cent reject Dublin. We need new thinking to produce a mutually acceptable compromise.' But if new thinking is what is needed, more violence may be all that is on offer: 'The question the IRA asks itself is how does it keep the issue in front of the British until proper negotiations take place? Bombs and bullets will not resolve the conflict but have kept the organisation in the picture.' Both men quickly expose the yawning gap in understanding between republicans and British governments of all persuasions which has fuelled the fight and in 25 years prematurely terminated 3,000 lives. London and Dublin win almost universal domestic and international support for insisting upon a permanent cessation of violence before talks. 'The IRA is expected to trust perfidious Albion? It is, in any case, arrogant to suggest the violence and terrorism is one-sided, that the IRA is the offender and the British are peacemakers,' says Mr O'Doherty, who joined the IRA in protest at the 1972 Bloody Sunday killings, when 13 civilians were shot dead by British troops. 'Britain tries to hijack the moral high ground as though it has nothing to answer for. It has injured people on the streets, immunised its own murderers from prosecution and committed terrible injustices. 'There are three armed struggles in Northern Ireland involving the IRA, the loyalist paramilitaries and the British. We are all covered in blood and all carry the responsibility for the mess and for clearing it up. The IRA will not lay down its weaponry and put a question-mark over the moral value of its struggle and the sacrifices of its volunteers on the basis of the deal on offer.' Both men believe the British government will swing on the hook of hypocrisy in its refusal to talk. 'They talked to the IRA during two ceasefires in 1972 and 1974, they have been talking again in the last three years and they talked during and after the Warrington bombs,' says Mr O'Doherty. 'We all know lines of communication have been open since the hunger strikes. Which is the principle at stake that has not already been breached?' asks Mr McKearney. So what must happen, in the eyes of hardline republicans, if the anguish is ever to end? The British government will first, says Mr O'Doherty, be expected to show some humility in a declaration repenting for 'centuries of injustice'. At the same time, he believes, the IRA will not countenance an end to armed struggle without the repatriation and eventual release of prisoners to whom it is unswervingly loyal. The British government has insisted there can be no amnesty for people who are not political prisoners but simply guilty of vicious crimes. According to Mr O'Doherty: 'The IRA will not have the British talk about a peace which entails the continuing retention of IRA prisoners. If the provisionals held hostages in return, would the British claim the conditions existed for a settlement?' Both men agree that the big failure in republican thinking is to see the British government as the only key to peace. A million unionists, acknowledges Mr O'Doherty, will not be suppressed, and they will have to be courted in the same way the British government must deal with the IRA. Unionists have to be reassured that, in any new arrangement, their constitutional rights are guaranteed, says Mr McKearney. He suggests 'something like a confederation or a unitary state or a canton which breaks the connection with the UK but does not necessarily involve parting'. Mr O'Doherty has in mind Britain and Ireland sharing sovereignty and responsibility for the north. Such language renders unionists apoplectic and London and Dublin unmoved. The governments insist on a ceasefire, underwrite the democratic will of the majority and restate their commitment to a peace initiative which, in trying to be all things to all people, threatens to satisfy none. The history of Northern Ireland, however, is replete with surprising ironies as well as tragedy. Both Mr McKearney and Mr O'Doherty spent several years in the same jail as the loyalist paramilitaries they were pledged to kill. They talked and mixed and came to see other side's point of view. They even struck up friendships. The trick is to repeat it in the world outside.   Countries:-  IEZ  Ireland, EC.   Industries:-  P8651 Political Organizations.   Types:-  CMMT  Comment  Analysis.

The US decision to grant Mr Adams a visa was met with outrage by unionists in the province, who warned that the Sinn Fein leader would fully exploit the visit for propaganda purposes. Some Ulster politicians now expect Mr Adams to use his visit to hold out the prospect of a temporary ceasefire by the IRA in order to extract maximum publicity from his short trip and to cast Sinn Fein as the peacemakers. British government sources in Northern Ireland, however, made it clear that any such gesture would be regarded as meaningless and that only a full renunciation of violence and a permanent ceasefire would help the peace process move forward. But the decision was given a cautious welcome by Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, who said the visit was acceptable if it helped bring closer the prospect of peace. Mr John Hume, leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party, and representatives of the Alliance party are also expected to attend today's conference called by the National Committee on American Foreign Policy. Unionists said the decision meant the US had relinquished any right to act as an intermediary in any efforts to bring peace to the province. The Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the hard-line Democratic Unionist party, accused the US administration of 'kow-towing' to the Boston Irish lobby. He will meet Mr Ray Seitz, the US ambassador in London, later this week to discuss the US decision. Mr Jim Molyneaux, the Ulster Unionist leader, accused the Clinton administration of 'presidential wobbling'. But Mr Adams claimed the decision to grant him a visa would advance the entire peace process in Northern Ireland. Before leaving for New York he said he thought the US could play an influential role in resolving the Ulster conflict. 'They can encourage the British without taking sides, and move the situation on,' he said. Asked whether he now renounced violence - one of the stipulations originally laid down for a visa - Mr Adams replied: 'My attitude is quite simple and straightforward - I want an end to violence.'

A report prepared by the CBI Northern Ireland over the past six months and released two weeks into the IRA ceasefire says a permanent cessation of violence and a political settlement could have a profound impact on the local economy. The CBI calls on the British government to develop a strategy which maintains existing public-expenditure levels but gradually redirects spending on law and order into a programme of wealth creation to offset job losses among security-related activities. The CBI warns that cuts in expenditure on security could mean substantial job losses and a sharp reduction in the number of army personnel in the province. Security spending in the province was almost Pounds 1bn last year, nearly three times the per-capita level in the rest of Britain. The knock-on effect could also mean extensive job losses. But the CBI also estimates that any losses could be offset by the creation of 29,000 jobs and up to 20,000 vocational training places by 1999. It says, however, that significantly higher levels of employment growth might be feasible given a revival of the province's declining manufacturing base. The report suggests some jobs would come as a result of a rise in inward investment. In the past 20 years external corporate investors have created 500 jobs a year in Ulster and the CBI says this could now rise within two or three years to at least 2,000. Other jobs, it says, should also emerge in the tourism industry, about 3,000 in the short term and up to 10,000 in the longer term. Any rise in funding for education and training might add another 1,500 jobs by 1999 and there would also be more in transport infrastructure, housing improvement and health and environmental services. Mr Doug Riley, chairman of CBI Northern Ireland, said that Ulster's business community believed the province was 'entering a new era' which would have to be built on co-operation. The CBI says the government will have to develop clear, long-term policies for public expenditure in full partnership with the private sector if it is to reinforce the benefits of peace. Maintaining high public spending in the province will be essential. Peace - a Challenging New Era. CBI Northern Ireland, Fanum House, 108 Great Victoria St, Belfast BT2 7PD. Free.

The talks about all the aspects of the Yugoslav crisis show the  common concern for peace, and the readiness of both sides to  contribute to a positive solution for Bosnia [words indistinct].

Jordan made no official response last night to Mr Rabin's offer to travel to Amman for informal peace talks, or his invitation to meet King Hussein in Israel. However, the Jordanian ruler has previously refused all offers of separate official talks with Israelis either in Jerusalem or in Amman. No immediate reaction was forthcoming from either Lebanon or Syria, but President Hafez al Assad, the Syrian president, has also professed the utmost resistance to visiting Israel. The only Arab leader to have made the trip was President Anwar Sadat, the assassinated Egyptian leader, in a gesture which helped forge peace between Cairo and Israel, but which ostracised Egypt from the rest of the Arab world. Senior Palestinian officials in Amman claimed that despite Mr Rabin's offer to seek a breakthrough in the peace process, the Israeli premier was avoiding what they called the 'pre-requisites for peace'. 'Our problem with Rabin is that he wants to sell himself as a peacemaker, but he has to prove himself with deeds, not words,' said one official. He said that Palestinian delegation at the peace talks wished to see Israel first accept in full the Geneva convention, which bans Israel, as an occupying power, from changing the identity of the West Bank and the Gaza strip. The official said that if Mr Rabin wishes to be serious about peace he must show 'genuine readiness' to halt all settlements on the West Bank. Palestinian officials said that Mr Rabin's offer to talk in neighbouring Arab capitals echoed calls from the previous Likud government for a normalisation of relations between Israel and its Arab neighbours. However, Palestinian groups and the Arab governments participating in the peace talks insist that Israel must first withdraw from the territories occupied in 1973 before there can be any normalisation of relations. The Arab delegations to the peace talks, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon and the Palestinians, have consistently rejected Israel's call for the negotiations to be conducted in the region.

Like a ghost  without a face and without a voice, who, from one of his 25 safe  houses in Belfast or his bomb-proof office on Falls Road, would  terrorize Britain with the mere mention of his name, which was  synonymous with fear, bombings, and mysteries.    Now Gerry Adams has come out of the shadows. The charismatic  leader of Sinn Fein (the Northern Irish party that is in  practice the political wing of the IRA), the man who has  survived dozens of attacks by Protestant Unionists and the  innumerable diplomatic traps of the oldest conflict in Europe,  has started showing his beard and his open smile around the  world. Like a real statesman.    First America, last week the Basque Country. Yesterday, he  arrived in Italy, where he will visit Venice, then Turin, for  the presentation of his book -- surprisingly, a narrative work.  It is called, ""The Road and Other Stories."" It is all set in  the poor and desperate streets of West Belfast, the Catholic  ghetto of the Northern Irish capital, where Adams was born and  where the guerrilla warfare is fiercest.    ""To describe it as a diplomatic offensive is perhaps going  too far,"" he said dismissively, persuasive, and polite. ""But  when the American Government granted me a visa, I accepted  invitations from organizations and friends. The visit was a  great success for Sinn Fein and for the cause of the Republican  movement. I was invited to visit the Basque Country a year ago,  and at last I accepted. I visited Italy in 1987 and I pledged  to return if ever one of my books were to be translated. Of  course, this has all happened at a rather busy time for the  negotiations on Northern Ireland, but I could not refuse.""    [Orizio] On 15 December 1993, there was the historic London  and Dublin agreement on ""the Northern Ireland people's right to  self-determination."" Sinn Fein asked for clarifications on 20  points. First, London said ""no,"" then it changed its mind.  Yesterday evening you received a partial reply: a ""yes"" to a  referendum in Ulster. Is this a victory? Does British Prime  Minister John Major accept you as interlocutors now?    [Adams] Yes, of course. But relations between Sinn Fein and  the British Government began in secret three years ago and have  never ceased. If there were not the Maastricht Treaty to  approve in Westminster, and therefore if a John Major with  problems had not needed to keep his Unionist votes safe, he  would have officially recognized us as a partner in the dialogue  much sooner. So yesterday's acknowledgement is nothing new.    [Orizio] But now Major is talking openly about a referendum,  to determine the future of Northern Ireland. This is something  new.    [Adams] Before making an assessment of the substance of the  British document, we will have to analyze its 21 pages  thoroughly. Permit me to say, however, that a 21-page reply to  just one of the points that we raised shows that we were right  to want to look into the matter more thoroughly and that we were  in good faith. Of course, we are clear about how the ""right to  self-determination"" would express itself, but we believe that  the entire people of Ireland, and not just of Northern Ireland,  are entitled to express themselves. Be that as it may, if this  British reply helps the dialogue to continue, it really is  welcome.    [Orizio] Are Major's domestic political problems influencing  the negotiations?    [Adams] Yes, and in a very negative way. Major's position is  so precarious that the prime minister is effectively being held  hostage by a group of members of parliament of the Tory Right,  who are holding him for ransom precisely over the Northern  Ireland issue. Without this problem, the negotiations would be  much further advanced.    [Orizio] But there is again more shooting going on in Ulster  than before. Why?    [Adams] It is the Protestant terrorists that are responsible  for almost all these bloodthirsty incidents. The other day they  killed two Catholic workers, 10 days ago an old lady who was  watching television. They are trying to frighten people. But  the worst thing is that they shoot with weapons supplied by the  British Government, as we have proved with documentary evidence.  These weapons came via South Africa and were brought in by a  British agent.    [Orizio] The British Government, however, accuses you  Republicans of having taken weapons from Iran, in exchange for  the elimination of political adversaries of the Ayatollah.    [Adams] It also accuses us of managing a drugs racket to  finance the struggle. It is all lies. Ridiculous stories.  Tehran has denied it, the IRA has denied it, and the Dublin  government has denied it. The fact is that it is all British  propaganda. After the support gathered during my visit to  America, London decided to respond by trying to discredit us.  But no one in Belfast believes these things.    [Orizio] Leaving these accusations aside, is there a hope of  peace now?    [Adams] I believe so. People want peace and the  international climate is favorable. Dialogue has resolved two  crises that seemed insoluble -- the Middle East and South  Africa. Now it is up to us. The political process of dialogue  must be started. We republicans believe in it.

Mr Tom Hartley, the national chairman of the IRA's political wing, said in Dublin a response would come only after Sinn Fein's so-called 'peace commission' had completed a series of public debates and consultations on the peace process in both parts of Ireland. This would take place over the next six weeks. The statement came as a visit to the province by Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, coincided with a fresh upsurge in terrorist violence. A woman soldier was shot and seriously injured in a republican area of north Belfast. But troops returned fire, arresting two men and seizing a loaded gun. Separately, the IRA said it had 'made a joke' of the 'colossal sums' spent by the government to fit police and army vehicles with updated armour-piercing weaponry. This followed a rocket attack in east Belfast on Tuesday night which left three policemen injured. Mr Rifkind, who was meeting security chiefs and soldiers, used the visit to hint that the number of troops there could be cut if the IRA responded positively to the UK-Irish declaration. 'Obviously if there was peace in Northern Ireland it would have very important implications for the security force presence which was needed,' Mr Rifkind said. Sinn Fein said the first public debate under its consultation process would be held in Londonderry on January 28. It would be followed by three others in the Republic up to February 19. Mr Pat Doherty, Sinn Fein's vice-president, said 'numerous groups' had requested meetings with the party, including Protestant organisations in Northern Ireland. This 'external consultation' as Sinn Fein calls it, is to take place in parallel with a series of internal party debates. Mr Doherty said that initial soundings within the party taken since the declaration was published on December 15 suggested there was 'an element of disappointment'. He added: 'But we wish to explore whether there is a genuine opportunity for peace in this document.' Mr Hartley confirmed that Mr Gerry Adams, the party president, had written to both the British and Irish prime ministers for 'clarifications'. Downing Street said yesterday it had not yet decided how to respond to Mr Adams' letter.   Countries:-  IEZ  Ireland, EC.   Industries:-  P9721 International Affairs.

Ms Marjorie Mowlam, shadow Northern Ireland secretary, said ahead of this week's international investment conference in Belfast that measures taken on the economy were crucial to the stability of the peace process. Voicing concern about the government's economic strategy in Ulster she warned that an important opportunity would be missed unless ministers thought 'strategically and long term' about economic regeneration and restructuring. Aid packages from Europe, the US and elsewhere were 'crucial pump-priming resources', she said. But co- ordination was vital to make sure that money was not just 'thrown at high-status projects which do not assist infrastructure growth'. She said public investment was bearing the brunt of cuts in the government's public spending plans for Northern Ireland, unveiled last week, which would result in a Pounds 75m real terms reduction in the budget by 1997-98.

President Hafiz al-Asad held telephone contacts with King  Husayn of Jordan and Lebanese President Ilyas al-Hirawi. He  received a telephone call from President Clinton in which the  peace process and the Security Council resolution were  discussed. A meeting of the Arab parties in the Washington  talks is expected to be held soon in order to discuss the  resumption of these talks. This is in light of international  developments and the conviction of the peace process cosponsors  and the entire international community about the importance of  carrying out intensive efforts to implement the Security Council  resolution and achieve peace in the region.    This is not the first time that Syria has taken the  initiative and contributed to the rescuing of the peace process.  It has done so several times, because it sensed, as it senses  now, a serious international trend to see a just and  comprehensive solution in the Middle East, based on the  resolutions of international legitimacy, and leading to a real  and lasting peace.    Security Council Resolution 904 was unanimously adopted. It  stands as a clear and strong condemnation of Israel and its  practices. For the first time in the history of the  Arab-Israeli conflict, the resolution calls for international  protection for our kinsfolk under occupation. Prominent  Security Council members demanded that the protection be real  and broad, and include our kinsfolk in occupied Jerusalem. For  his part, President Clinton announced that peace with Syria is  of the utmost importance, and hailed Syria's sincere peaceful  trends.    It is natural that Syria works to employ this international  trend in the interest of the just and comprehensive peace for  which it is calling, and in a way that puts Israel to the test.  Israel should either bow to the will of international peace or  drop its last mask and face the world's strong criticism and  whatever measures the international community might take.    Undoubtedly, the peace process -- despite Israel's  intransigence and procrastination -- took an important step  forward in the adoption of Security Council Resolution 904. Tel  Aviv's rulers have no excuse for evading the requirements of the  peace process, especially exchanging land for peace. Israel's  rulers will no longer be able to use the Arab desires for peace  as a pretext, because they are the most sincere desires. The  international community, especially the United States, has felt  Arab eagerness for peace and Syria's serious contribution to  repeatedly salvaging of the peace process from collapse as a  result of Israel's practices and the designs of its rulers.    As all admit, peace cannot be made in vacuum, but should be  based on the resolutions and the objective bases represented in  Security Council Resolutions 242, 338, and 425, and the  principle of land for peace. In other words, Israel has no  choice but to return the occupied Arab territories and recognize  the Palestinian people's national rights. These stand as the  essence of the Security Council resolutions. Any Israeli delay  and procrastination designed to evade these resolutions will  only increase tension in the region, and may lead to new brutal  actions by Zionist settlers that will be firmly and decisively  rejected by the international community.    If Resolution 904 asks Israel to disarm its settlers, then  any new criminal action by settlers will surely lead to broad  international protection in the occupied territories. However,  Israel is skillful in the arts of procrastination and  maneuvering. It has been carrying out a large-scale policy of  deception since 1948. It has always shown a disdain for the  principles and resolutions of the international community. For  more than two years, it has been aborting the peace talks in  Washington. If these talks are expected to produce a just and  comprehensive solution in the Middle East, the international  community should place its full weight behind efforts to  implement its resolutions, support its credibility, and end the  Israeli occupation.    It is important for the international community to double  its  efforts so it will not face new Israeli massacres that may  destroy the whole peace process.     "

KNU president Gen Bo Mya told 500 guests, who attended his  67th birthday celebrations at his Manerplaw camp opposite Mae  Sariang district, that the Karen always wanted national  reconciliation but their three offers for peace talks had not  received any response from SLORC. Gen Bo Mya criticised other  minority groups for giving up their armed struggle against  Rangoon.    ""The KNU will definitely conduct peace talks with SLORC if  the negotiations are on equal terms to sincerely obtain rights  and freedom in all economic, social and political fields for all  Burmese groups. The peace agreement reached separately with  various minority groups does not guarantee a true peace.""    Gen Bo Mya, who leads the strongest anti-Rangoon minority  group, said the KNU would not join SLORC at the negotiating  table until Rangoon accepted all these conditions.    The truce talks, if agreed on, could be held in a third  country such as Thailand which cherished ""the constructive  engagement"" policy with SLORC, Gen Bo Mya said.     "

How do you view the future  of these talks? What is Lebanon's role in these talks?    [Fadlallah] In my opinion, in Lebanon the dimensions of the  peace talks are far greater than in other countries because we  have factions that differ on the peace talks. There is a group  that accepts the concept of absolute peace and another group  rejects it in toto. Another group wishes to accept it  conditionally while yet another group wants to reject it if  there are any conditions. Thus, I believe that in Lebanon, any  cultural or political move on peace or other issues has far  greater consequences than in other countires.    As for the future of peace, the talks lack an element of  greatness and effectiveness which could culminate in some  definite outcome in the future. This is because the problems  between the Arabs and the Zionist regime have some difficult  conflicts that cannot be resolved in a year.    In any case, I do feel that the talks are moving toward  peace. This is because the regional and international  situations--with all they entail--exert pressure on all sides to  sign the peace accord. Of course, this pressure is directed more  toward the Arabs than Israel. The present political and  security situation in the region has endangered the interests of  the big governments, the United States in particular. [passage  omitted]    If the Arab and Islamic worlds were to wake up from their  prolonged slumber, it is possible that they could foil the U.S.  and Zionist plans, but the problem is that we do not see any  basic political revolution. What we see here is only political  talk or political plans. In fact, those who reject the peace  process do not have any definite or formulated program on how to  handle the various stages of the peace plan. Therefore what we  see are mere airy notions, slogans, plans and stances, most of  which have no relation to other stances and programs.    Thus, when we look at international realities and the  current  weakness in the Arab and Islamic world, as well as those who are  opposed to the talks, we conclude that in the course of one or  two years the talks will fall into the groove that was  envisioned for them. Many people believe that if the peace  talks do not yield any results by the end of 1994, they will be  postponed to after the U.S. elections, as the Americans usually  begin preparing for the next presidential elections two years  after a new president takes office. Meanwhile, the American Jews  will be able to take advantage of this opportunity to put the  necessary pressure on the talks, which will then halt these  talks. It is to the Zionists' advantage to keep the talks like  this and not to let them make any headway, but at the same time  they want to get whatever they want from the talks.    Lebanon does not have a fundamental role in these talks, as  it usually keeps in step with Syria with regard to relations  with the Zionist regime and on the subject of peace talks. It  is no secret that Lebanon's position is closely linked with the  Syrian stance. It is natural that this would prevent Lebanon  from falling into internal or external schemes for a separate  peace with the Zionist regime. This relationship between  Lebanon and Syria--even though it is considered to have some  weak points--has some positive aspects too.    [ETTELA'AT] How do you assess the latest events in Lebanon,  the revelation of those responsible for the bombing of Sayyidat  al- Najat Church, and the Lebanese Government's clash with the  Lebanese Forces led by Samir Ja'ja'? Is it expected that the  Lebanese Government will step up its confrontation with other  groups in Lebanon?    [Fadlallah] It is natural that there should be a U.S. plan  for Lebanon, namely, that the army take over the security bases  in Lebanon. This would enable it to exert political pressure.  The United States is seeking to do this with all its might. The  United States has chosen the Lebanese Army as a means to this  end.    It is not too farfetched to believe that on the domestic  level, there has been some sort of agreement with Syria. But  the Army's complete control or deployment is not as negative for  Lebanon as chaos and disarray would be harmful to it. But many  politicians believe that this Lebanese fear of chaos and  disarray may be misused to impose new restrictions in Lebanon,  which would not be in the interest of public freedom. We do see  such stances, which are opposed to freedom, in Lebanon.    In the newspapers, in the general political atmosphere, and  in some of the government sources in Lebanon, there is talk of  pressure on some groups, especially Hizballah. This is because  Hizballah is considered the representative of the opposition  forces, considered to be under Iran's support and orders. It is  the only armed group that still has its weapons, because its  weapons are used in the resistance of the occupation of south  Lebanon. This has prevented pressure from being exerted on it  by the Lebanese Government.    In the circumstances, the Lebanese Government will not  permit  the suppression of Hizballah or of the Islamic Resistance. This  is because the Islamic Resistance Movement has lawful local,  regional, and international reasons for existing and the  governments are forced to accept them. The Islamic Resistance  Movement is a popular movement that demands the withdrawal of  foreigners from these territories.    From this angle, the Lebanese Government, an ally of the  Syrian Government, cannot resort to crushing the Resistance,  because Syria would not agree. Any confrontation of the  Resistance by the Lebanese Government would also generate  problems, which could usher in a return to civil war in Lebanon.  Despite this and without resorting to tackling the issue of the  Islamic Resistance directly, the Lebanese Government will take  measures to implement some plans that would place Hizballah in a  position of weakness.    [ETTELA'AT] How do you view the role of the Islamic  Resistance in the south?    [Fadlallah] In my view, the Islamic Resistance Movement  enjoys freedom of action politically and militarily. But it may  encounter major difficulties if the talks achieve results and  peace with the Zionist regime. Then the conditions in the Arab  world will exert pressure on the Islamic Resistance. There  could be efforts to embroil the Islamic Resistance in  differences and internal dissent, just as we witnessed clashes  in the past between the Hizballah and Amal movements. The  Resistance will face greater hardships and problems but this  does not mean it will succumb to them. The Islamic Resistance  may have other choices in the resistance of the Zionist regime  and these may be different from those they have now.    [ETTELA'AT] How do you view the effect of the Gaza-Jericho  Accord and a regional economic accord between the Arab countries  and the Zionist regime on Iran, from the security and economic  point of view?    [Fadlallah] The Zionist regime is using the Gaza-Jericho  Accord as a gateway to the Arab world through the Palestinians.  The Zionist regime is using the Palestinians as a bridge to  link it with the Arab world by signing economic agreements.  This is why we see the Zionists giving greater importance to  talks on economic issues with the Palestinians, as their  objective is to gain economic influence in the Arab world and  the Middle East.    The U.S. role in this regard is to abolish the concept of  the ""Arab world"" so that it can create a strategic, political,  and economic region in the Middle East within an international  order which conforms to U.S. interests. It is for this reason  that the United States speaks of the Middle East and not of the  Arab world, and is considering using Turkey as a strong factor  in security, political, and economic transactions in the region.    I imagine that the future position of the Islamic Republic  of  Iran will be difficult as the United States is proposing to  embargo it unless it accepts U.S. conditions. In the U.S.  scheme of things, a toppling of the Islamic system is not  necessary, as long as it conforms to U.S. plans in the region  and retreats where U.S. policies are concerned. This is  something that Iran has not accepted so far.    Therefore, the current economic situation will exert greater  pressure on the Islamic Republic of Iran as economic relations  increase. This will also be true from a security point of view.  Iran should be especially prepared, as this plan has some  dangerous elements. We have complete faith that the leadership  of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Ayatollah Khamene'i, and  President Hashemi- Rafsanjani, will follow these developments  through the Supreme National Security Council or other bodies.  It is also the obligation of the Muslim Iranian people to ward  off these new plots -- that is the economic, security, and  political embargo by the United States -- and they should remain  steadfastly their leadership.

[Ljubljankic] We still demand the return of our occupied  territory, in which massacres and ethnic hostilities continue.  In fact, this is the demand of our parliament and we cannot  concede it. On the basis of the Geneva conference and the peace  proposals presented therein, the return of four percent of our  territory to the Muslim areas is to ensure our interests and we  cannot abandon it.    [ETTELA'AT] How do you view the Bihac adventurists in view  of the situation currently prevailing in Bosnia-Herzegovina?    [Ljubljankic] Fikret Edic is a die-hard communist who has  never defended Muslim interests. He is colluding with Bosnia's  neighbors -- the Serbs and Croats -- to undermine the stamina of  the Muslims at a time when Bosnia-Herzegovina is gasping in the  throes of a life and death struggle.    Edic has reaped much profit in this manner, which he is now  spending on catering to the needs of the rebels. This is an act  of treason to the motherland and he is a traitor in our eyes.  The Bosnian army is successfully defending Western Bosnia  against the Serbs and the forces of the traitor Edic in most  difficult conditions and we are trying to approach Edic's  command base in Valica Klarosa [name as transliterated].    [ETTELA'AT] What is your assessment of the future of Bosnia-  Herzegovina in the event of the division of the country into  three ethnic parts? Will peace return to Bosnia-Herzegovina if  such a partition takes place?    [Ljubljankic] Bosnia-Herzegovina has always been considered  a culturally diverse society with much variety among the various  minorities. Then, a century ago we saw the end of five  centuries of Ottoman rule, which had been able to insure  tolerance and coexistence among the religions. At present we  are in a situation in which we are forced to be realistic.  There may be ethnic divisions, but that concept will not bring  peace.    The basic condition of peace -- that is, justice -- has not  been taken into consideration.    [ETTELA'AT] What is the best way of providing assistance to  Bosnia-Herzegovina in view of the arms embargo against your  country?    [Ljubljankic] There is no other way to assist  Bosnia-Herzegovina at this moment. The best way would be to  provide financial assistance so that the country can strengthen  its economy and purchase weapons.    [ETTELA'AT] What effect do the practical and theoretical  stances of the Islamic countries, including that of the Islamic  Republic of Iran, have on the enemies' aggression? What are  Bosnia-Herzegovina's expectations of the world's countries and  how do you feel these are being met?    [Ljubljankic] The Islamic countries are all endowed with  growing economic power. We expect them to use this economic  power to exert pressure on the Western countries so that the  arms embargo imposed on us will be lifted. In every city of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, there are churches alongside the mosques.  Unfortunately because of the fascist ideas of ethnic cleansing,  all the mosques in the cities under Serb and Croat occupation  have been destroyed.    The idea of dividing the country into ethnic regions is a  new  concept that never existed before in our country. We would  prefer that Bosnia-Herzegovina retain its unique heritage in the  world; this is quite a practical concept. [passage omitted]    If the arms embargo is lifted, we can solve our problems  quickly. Even if this does not happen, politico-economic  pressure would help boost the Muslims' stance at the peace talks.    [ETTELA'AT] The recent talks in Geneva and Brussels are the  latest efforts to end the Bosnian crisis. In your opinion, will  these be successful?    [Ljubljankic] The Geneva and Brussels talks give the  European Union an opportunity to prove that those countries are  sincere in doing something for Bosnia-Herzegovina on the  political level. Unfortunately, the European countries are not  able to motivate the Serbs to grant even a few concessions.  Europe lacks the necessary ability and instruments to get these  concessions; this is due to the absence of the political  determination to use all necessary force.    The talks are not successful at present; they merely  motivate  the Serbs to perpetrate greater atrocities, so that the cities  in Bosnia-Herzegovina are being shelled and civilians killed.    [ETTELA'AT] What is your opinion of the possibility of the  Islamic Conference Organization [ICO] participating in the peace  talks that are being held in Europe?    [Ljubljankic] This proposal, which was presented by the  other sided at the peace talks, will not be accepted within the  framework of the current talks.    Perhaps in the new talks this could get more consideration  for Bosnia-Herzegovina, a totally new round of talks that should  be based on documents by the United Nations and the CSCE. The  ICO should influence the talks by using its political and  economic power as leverage.     "

They also denounced the 27-month-old Arab-Israeli peace  process and demanded that the Palestine Liberation Organisation  (PLO) renounce its Sept. 13 autonomy agreement with Israel and  leave the peace talks altogether.    Calls for retribution for the attack in the Ibrahimi Mosque  in Hebron, where an Israeli settler opened machine-gun fire on  worshippers early Friday, were a dominant theme for a  demonstration in this camp of nearly 100,000 residents.    ""Where are you Saddam, where are your missiles,"" chanted the  crowd, repeating after half a dozen masked youths perched atop a  pickup truck mounted with loud speakers. They were referring to  Iraqi President Saddam Husayn, who fired more than 40 long-range  missiles at Israel during the 1991 Gulf War over Kuwait.    For many residents of this squalid camp, President Saddam,  despite Iraq's defeat in the war, remains a hero who was  entrapped by the U.S. and other Israeli allies into a war aimed  at eliminating Iraq's military power which they saw as a  potential threat to the Jewish state.    ""Would the Israelis dare to slaughter Palestinians if Iraq  was as strong as it was before the war?"" asked Husayn who wore a  headdress to conceal his face.    The situation in al-Baq'ah appeared under control, but  residents said emotions ran high and that they could not rule  out individual acts of violence similar to an attack in downtown  Amman where a British tourist was stabbed by a native of Hebron.    ""People are enraged and seething with anger and frustration  over their inability to do anything to avenge the killings,""  said an elderly grocer in al-Baq'ah. ""Many people here are from  Hebron and no doubt some of their relatives were among the dead  and injured at Ibrahimi Mosque.""    Black flags hung over electric poles and men and women  gathered at street corners listening to radios and exchanging  information to find out whether any of their relatives were  among the victims of the attack.    Rejection of the peace talks with Israel was another  dominant  call of the protesters as they wound through the narrow streets  of this camp, one of 11 camps housing nearly 300,000 Palestinian  refugees in Jordan.    ""No to peace and yes to the gun,"" they chanted, demanding an  end to Palestinain participation in the peace negotiations. ""No  to self-rule, yes to holy war.""    Despite the relative strength of PLO Chairman Yasir  'Arafat's  mainstream Fatah among al-Baq'ah residents, many of those taking  part in the protest said they felt the PLO-led peace talks with  Israel were getting nowhere.    ""As the talks get from one round to another, it is becoming  increasingly clear that Israel has no intention of returning the  land to us,"" said Walid Nash'at, who was seven when his family  fled their home village in the West Bank in 1967.    ""I supported the autonomy accord from the very beginning,  hoping that it would lead to a just solution to our problems,""  said 'Amr, an electrician who declined to give his second name.    ""But it seems that our problems are only getting worse, if  Israelis can massacre Palestinians with impunity,"" he said.    Muhammad 'Uwaydah, an Islamic Action Front (IAF) member of  Parliament from al-Baq'ah, told the rally: ""Today's killing has  proved that there cannot be any coexistence with Israel.""    ""I call on the Palestinian leadership to withdraw from the  peace talks,"" he said as the crowd shouted: ""Allahu Akbar"" and  ""Jihad (holy war) is the only road to Palestine.""     "

Whichever direction Ulster takes from what the high command of the provisional IRA calls an 'historic crossroads', it will be too late for Mr Sean McDermott, the 37-year-old Catholic shot dead by loyalist gunmen just 12 hours before the midnight ceasefire began. But, for the baby boy born to Lisa Stewart in Belfast's city hospital six hours and six minutes into the peace, there is the chance of a life free of the troubles which began the year his mother was born. Whether the province is finally awakening from a 25-year nightmare, which by last night had claimed 3,170 lives, or is preparing for something worse, will now begin to unfold, fitfully and unpredictably, over the next weeks and months. The rows over the calculated decision of the IRA not to commit itself to the 'permanent' ceasefire demanded by London and Dublin and on the untimely return to Ulster jails of four republican prisoners, which hinted at secretly agreed concessions by London, will not be the last. They will appear trifling compared with what lies ahead, and the leadership qualities and goodwill of everyone involved will be severely tested. The timing of a breakthrough delivered by the republican movement came as a surprise after nearly nine months of private prevarication and public point-scoring on the contents of last December's Downing Street declaration  -London and Dublin's best shot at establishing an universally acceptable blueprint for a lasting political settlement for Ulster. Though the announcement came suddenly, the underlying shift in attitudes has been more gradual. Upbeat predictions had been made before in the land of false dawns, but this time they reflected a perceptible change in attitudes within the community. Under the leadership of Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein - the IRA's political arm  -has been pursuing for seven years its own Irish peace initiative. Its efforts - against a background of dwindling public support and a growing recognition that consent, not coercion, was the only strategy supported in both north and south - have been met from outside with contempt. But Mr Adams has managed to cultivate within republican ranks a culture of debate and the notion of political negotiation as an alternative to the Armalite. The leadership of Sinn Fein and the IRA appear to understand that the ability to kill has not brought much progress towards British withdrawal and a united Ireland. While there is no deviation from its ultimate objective of a 32-county Irish republic, it is prepared to try an alternative route. According to Mr Adams: 'Irish nationalism has sufficient political confidence, weight and support to bring about the changes essential for a just and lasting peace.' While the IRA and Sinn Fein have made the running - manipulating and sometimes winning the propaganda battle with London - the unionists have seemed to be outflanked and at risk of being swept along by events. Twenty years ago, hardliners in the Protestant community were able to combine forces to bring down the newly established power-sharing executive, demonstrating a unity and resolve which is no longer evident. Now, the broad body of unionists face a stark choice. They can try to wreck any new political initiatives to preserve a status quo no longer acceptable in London, or they can help forge a compromise package of political and constitutional change. Confronting them as they choose will be a formidable coalition stretching from Washington to west Belfast. Whatever happens Protestants intend to keep a tight grip on the rock which guarantees Ulster a place in the United Kingdom for as long as the majority wishes. For Mr John Major, maintaining the unionists' trust will be of paramount concern - hence reports of a prime minister 'livid' over the return to Ulster of IRA prisoners. Hence, too the fact that it was Mr James Molyneaux, the patient, profoundly sceptical leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, who was first into Downing Street after the ceasefire announcement. So far, Mr Molyneaux remains on board and behind a Downing Street declaration he once dismissed as 'a dead Christmas tree'. And he will be called on to try contain the loyalist paramilitary threat to further progress. Yesterday, hopes were rising that, while further revenge attacks by loyalist extremists cannot be ruled out, they might suspend violence if reassured about Ulster's right to self-determination. Mr Major, whose bold, joint initiative with Dublin has brought republicans to the negotiating ante-room, will be less concerned about the continuing self-exclusion from any future talks of the Rev Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionist Party. The hope is that, eventually, his still-potent voice will be undermined by political momentum. Provided the IRA ceasefire holds, Downing Street is unlikely to delay much longer recognition that the IRA action is intended to be permanent. This would mean that initial, exploratory contact between British government officials and Sinn Fein could take place before Christmas. Sinn Fein dialogue with the Dublin government will begin earlier, with Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish premier, anxious to embrace northern republicans in his proposed north-south Irish Forum for Peace and Reconciliation. The forum could be operational by October. Mr Adams, on a path perhaps even more dangerous than Mr Major's, will need rapid evidence that the ceasefire is paying dividends to keep his supporters behind him. The UK government is likely to oblige with an early end to the broadcasting ban on Sinn Fein. Equally important for British ministers will be success in their joint efforts with the Irish government to piece together the pivotal framework document on which political and constitutional progress can be based. The document could be finalised next month, and will include a power-sharing Ulster assembly and a number of cross-border institutions. It will also incorporate changes to the Irish constitution, possibly involving a referendum, renouncing Ireland's territorial claim on the north. In return, Britain will amend the 1920 Government of Ireland Act which gives Westminster 'supreme authority' over Northern Ireland. The gesture is seen by Britain as largely symbolic, given subsequent legislation enshrining the principle of majority consent for changes in Ulster's constitutional position. The format for planned bilateral exploratory talks between Sinn Fein and British government officials is undecided. But secret discussions between the two sides in 1993 envisaged exchanges involving three representatives from each side. These talks will enter totally uncharted waters and could easily expose the obstacles that cause the peace process to come unstuck. Under the heading 'practical consequences of ending violence', will come the intensely emotive and complex question of all-round demilitarisation, without which further progress will be impossible. Any hope of bringing all parties to round-table talks will stand or fall on the removal of terrorist weaponry and the threat that it could be used again. Sinn Fein and the IRA will be equally adamant in demanding a comparable de-escalation of British military and security forces, including a withdrawal of British troops initially to barracks and ultimately back to the mainland. The issue of IRA prisoners will prove as intractable. 'Our prisoners come first and last. If they are not released, you can forget the whole thing,' a senior republican source says. Downing Street has rejected a general amnesty, and unionists intend to keep Mr Major to his word. Only when the matters of weaponry and prisoners have been resolved can the crucial constitutional issues be addressed in wider talks aimed at securing a comprehensive, negotiated political settlement. At their heart is the issue of self-determination and what Sinn Fein calls the loyalist 'veto' over moves towards a united Ireland. The going here will be no easier. Republicans have now embraced the principle of unionist consent, but only in the context of the right to self-determination of the Irish people as a whole. In other words, Ulster can have its referendum but only the decision of all the people of Ireland will count. Mr Adams also insists that Britain has a responsibility to persuade unionists that their best interests lie in 'the creation of an agreed and stable Ireland'. Mr Major, however, will not join the persuaders or withdraw safeguards for unionists. A shift on either could see him destroyed at the hands of Westminster's Ulster unionists and unhappy Tory MPs. The agenda for agreement looks impossibly daunting but then, until recently, the prospect of any progress between two historically and diametrically opposed forces appeared fanciful. If the politicians have their doubts, an Ulster opinion poll yesterday showed only 9 per cent of Protestants and 58 per cent of Catholics believe the ceasefire will last. Suspicions are held equally deeply on both sides; those of Ulster's Protestant community who can contemplate negotiation with those they consider mass murdererers do so only because the prize of peace is desperately sought. There are understandable suspicions that the IRA's gesture is a sham, and that the organisation is only intent upon further destabilising the province before returning to violence when it can justify a resumption. Republicans believe they have cause to doubt the good intentions of a British government they say has betrayed them too many times in the past and which wants to trap them into a peace before replacing Ulster on the political back-burner. The IRA and Sinn Fein know that the passage of time would make any return to violence harder to justify and would lose them any credit recently won from a relieved domestic and international community. But, as the week ended, there was an unfamiliar, enjoyable peace along the Shankill and up the Falls, across the Highfield estate to Andersonstown. Republicans have a gaelic battle cry of Tiochfaidh ar la] - our time will come - while hardline unionists shout 'No surrender]' The two sides remain divided by a gulf of historic proportions but the overriding hope is that the gap may just have started to close.

They did not make any press statements but an Iranian  diplomatic source told IRNA after the 45-minute meeting that the  talks ""went very well.""    ""They discussed bilateral relations and the situation in the  Balkans and the Middle East.""    Meanwhile, Balkan Greece and the Islamic Republic of Iran  are  to exert joint efforts to end the bloodshed in  Bosnia-Herzegovina (B-H).    ""I will soon contact Bosnian President Mr. (Alija)  Izetbegovic, with whom we have close ties, to discuss the  European Union's (EU) peace proposal, but peace should be just  and honorable,"" Velayati made it clear to reporters after talks  with his Greek counterpart Karolos Papoulias.    The Greek minister said he briefed Velayati on the efforts  of  the EU to find peace in B-H, and added that Greece as the  current president of the EU, will exert efforts for peace in B-H.    Velayati and Papoulias held 60-minutes of talks on a wide  range of issues before being joined by the delegations of the  two countries.    Papoulias said they discussed issues of common interest, the  Balkans and the situation in former Yugoslavia, and Velayati  briefed him on the problems in the Persian Gulf region.    ""We held very significant talks and we reached good results  in all sectors,"" the Greek foreign minister stressed.    He said Velayati will send a special envoy to Athens to meet  with Greek economy undersecretary to discuss ways to boost  bilateral commercial and economic ties.    Velayati described the talks as ""very friendly,"" and said he  had extended an invitation to his Greek counterpart to visit  Tehran. A Greek diplomatic source told IRNA Papoulias is  expected to visit the Islamic Republic in March.    Earlier, speaking to IRNA, Papoulias said Athens will help  in  promoting EU-Iran dialogue and in bringing Tehran closer to the  12-member European bloc. Greece assumed the rotating six-month  EU presidency on January 1.    When asked about his recent talks in Washington, Papoulias  declined to disclose the contents of his discussions with senior  American officials.    Velayati arrived in Athens Thursday night for a 24-hour  working visit, accompanied by Hoseyn Nuqrekar Shirazi, deputy  commerce minister, 'Ali Ahani, the director of West European  affairs at Iran's Foreign Ministry, Ibrahim Rahimpour, director  of East European affairs, and other Foreign Ministry officials.    Greece was the third leg of Velayati's Balkan tour. He  visited Bulgaria and Romania and will fly to Turkey Friday  afternoon.    The Iranian foreign minister will meet the leader of the  Political Spring Party Antonis Samaras before leaving Athens.    Samaras visited Tehran in 1991 when he was the foreign  minister under the conservative new democracy government.    An Iranian diplomatic source told IRNA that Velayati's visit  to Bulgaria and Romania was of outmost important. ""We have an  annual trade exchange of around dlrs 1 billion with Bulgaria and  Romania together, 70 percent of which is Iran's oil exports,""  the diplomat told IRNA requesting anonymity.    He said Tehran has welcomed the new atmosphere in East  Europe, ""the atmosphere of freedom, democracy and parliament.""    Iran was thinking of opening an embassy in the only European  Muslim-majority state of Albania, he added.     "

As Ulster Unionist MPs said privately that they were looking for an 'enduring' agreement that would result in Northern Ireland being governed more like other parts of the UK, the prime minister held out the prospect of the province's constitutional status being written into a new Anglo-Irish agreement. No deal is expected to be struck until hours before tonight's vote.

IT  IS BASED ON FOREIGN MEDIA CONTENT AND BEHAVIOR AND IS  ISSUED WITHOUT COORDINATION WITH OTHER U.S. GOVERNMENT  COMPONENTS.  FBIS TRENDS-22APR94-JORDAN         King Tempers Statement on al-'Aqabah Issue and Peace Process            King Tempers Statement on al-'Aqabah Issue and Peace Process      SUMMARY                                 In an apparent effort to reassure the international community  that Jordan remains committed to the peace process, King Husayn  has issued statements that appear to soften an earlier ultimatum  linking Amman's continued participation in Mideast peace talks to  a change in the procedure of UN-mandated Multinational  Interdiction Force (MIF) inspections of ship cargo bound for the  Port of al-'Aqabah, which Jordanian media characterize as a  severe hardship for Jordan's economy.  Although the King's recent  remarks make it clear that Amman wants to remain a full  participant in the peace process, the government may find it  difficult to justify its participation amid increasing anti-U.S.  sentiment unless progress on the al-'Aqabah issue is forthcoming.                          END SUMMARY      Recent statements by King Husayn have signaled Amman's continued  commitment to the peace process and its conviction that a  solution to the al-'Aqabah issue is imminent.  Addressing a news  conference during the visit of Austrian President Klestil, the  king characterized the present mode of al-'Aqabah inspections as  ""totally intolerable,"" but added that the government had ""an  indication that the problem is being addressed, and we hope that  we will have a positive response soon"" (Jordan Television, 16  April).  More recently, Husayn took pains to emphasize Amman's  role in the peace process, stating that ""we in Jordan have  reiterated our position in terms of our readiness and  determination to work seriously to implement the provisions of  the agenda . . . approved after the signing of the Palestinian-  Israeli agreement in Washington"" (Jordan Television, 16 April).  Echoing the king's conciliatory tone, House of Representatives  speaker Tahir al-Masri stated that there are ""clear and strong  signs"" that a resolution of the al-'Aqabah issue is at hand.  He  reiterated Jordan's ""strategic"" interest in the peace process,  adding that a resolution of the al-'Aqabah issue would ""reflect  positively on Jordan's stand toward the peace process"" (Paris  Radio Monte Carlo, 15 April).     The statements mark a departure from the king's strong statement  to the five ambassadors of the UN Security Council permanent  members on 28 March asserting that the resumption of talks with  Israel was contingent on resolving the ""completely unacceptable  situation"" in al-'Aqabah, which constitutes a ""direct affront to  Jordan's dignity"" (Jordan Times 29 March).  The king's statement  came amid the backdrop of a flood of articles in Jordan's semi-  independent press criticizing the slow progress in reaching an  accommodation with Washington on changing the mode of the MIF  inspections.      Media Protest Escalation of al-'Aqabah Searches      Although Jordanian media have long criticized the MIF inspections  of ships bound for al-'Aqabah port as an economically burdensome  by-product of the UN sanctions against Iraq, the issue has taken  on a highly politicized dimension in recent months and has  dominated press editorials as a result of a perception that the  stepped-up MIF searches constitute U.S. pressure on Amman to sign  a peace agreement with Israel.  In February, Jordanian media  began noting a substantial increase in the frequency of MIF  interceptions of Jordan-bound ships (See Note 1), and press  articles viewed the phenomenon as ""harassment"" and U.S. arm-  twisting to force Jordan to sign a unilateral peace treaty with  Israel and initiate an end to the Arab boycott of Israel (Al-  Ra'y, 1 February).     (Note 1) A Jordan Times report noted that a ship held for  inspection at the Straits of Tiran on 17 April was the 13th  vessel intercepted by the MIF this year, compared to a total of  20 for all of 1993.  The report concluded that since none of the  more than 1,700 ships inspected since the inception of the  process had been found to be carrying cargo in contravention of  the Iraq sanctions, the inspection regime is a ""deliberate  harassment aimed at pressuring the Kingdom to make sweeping,  illogical concessions to Israel in the peace talks"" (19 April).     At the same time, some Amman papers were reporting that the U.S.  appeared receptive to a proposed land-based procedure for the al-  'Aqabah inspections that would ease the economic cost to Jordan,  and expressed optimism that the U.S. would act swiftly on the  issue.  Al-Dustur cited the spokesman for the Jordanian  delegation to the talks with Israel, Marwan al-Mu'ashshir, as  saying that during the king's January visit to Washington, the  U.S. Administration had ""welcomed the idea of replacing sea  searches by an international on-land inspection of the goods  bound for Jordan through the Gulf of Aqaba.""  Al-Mu'ashshir even  hinted at a possible quid pro quo by Amman, noting that while a  final decision on the Arab boycott issue rested with the Arab  League, ""the secondary and tertiary boycott can be studied, and  ways can be worked out to deal with this matter"" (1 February).     In the wake of a subsequent lack of movement on the al-'Aqabah  issue, coupled with the mid-March UN Security Council renewal of  the economic embargo against Iraq, press editorials stepped up  their anti-U.S. rhetoric (Jordan Times 22 March, Al-Ra'y 21  March), and government resolve to deal decisively with the matter  crystallized.  Only hours before the arrival of U.S. special  envoy Dennis Ross in Amman, the Jordanian House of  Representatives issued a statement calling on the government to  suspend its role in the peace process ""until the U.S.-led  blockade on the Red Sea port of al-'Aqabah is actually lifted""  (Jordan Times, 23 March).  The highly charged atmosphere  surrounding the Ross visit was reflected in the press, which  noted coolly that while Ross said Washington would ""study""  Jordanian proposals to change the MIF procedures, he ""refused to  make any promises that these pressures would be lifted"" (Akhbar  al-Usbu', 24 March).      Government Signals Displeasure      In further indications of Jordanian displeasure with the slow  progress of negotiations on al-'Aqabah, the government chose to  cancel a high-level trip to Washington and lowered its level of  representation at various multilateral peace talks committee  meetings.  However, Jordan's decision to downgrade its  representatives at multilateral meetings--rather than boycott the  sessions altogether--signaled its reluctance to risk serious  disruption of the peace negotiations.     --In place of an official delegation, Amman sent an observer to  the 7 April multilateral talks on environmental issues ""because  we are still awaiting Washington's decision on the Port of al-  'Aqabah blockade,"" according to Foreign Ministry officials cited  by Al-Ra'y (7 April).     --Similarly, Jordan reduced its level of representation at the  Oman multilateral talks on water rights to observer status (Al-  Dustur, 17 April); in the previous four sessions of the water  committee, Amman had participated with a six-member official  delegation  (Amman Radio, 19 April).     --Crown Prince Hasan reportedly canceled a visit to Washington  scheduled for 20 April ""following the U.S.-Jordanian tension  resulting from the al-'Aqabah Port blockade""  (Al-Majd, 18  April).     --Amman declined to host a regional conference on economic  investment slated for 1O April that was to have included an  Israeli delegation (Al-Majd, 18 April).      Student Protest Underscores Domestic Discord      Reflecting one facet of the domestic pressures the government  faces on the issues of al-'Aqabah and the peace process from an  increasingly vocal press and public, the Jordan Times reported a  demonstration of between 500 and 1,000 University of Jordan  students against the al-'Aqabah inspections, noting that the  fundamentalist-oriented ""Islamic bloc"" dominated the event.  The  newspaper reported that the students called on the government to  ""withdraw from the peace process altogether"" (21-22 April).  They  also ""set fire to U.S. and Israeli flags,"" and ""raised posters  supporting His Majesty King Husayn's pan-Arab policies and  condemning Washington's arrogant policy,"" according to Akhbar al-  Usbu' (21 April).      Implications      The recent escalation in the number of al-'Aqabah inspections-  -and the accompanying public and press perception of the MIF  searches as being a form of U.S. political pressure--have posed  considerable challenges to the government's stated intent to  continue its active role in the peace process.  A modified  arrangement at al-'Aqabah that would ease the strain on the  domestic economy is clearly what Amman is seeking.  Such an  accommodation would likely go a long way toward easing internal  pressures on the government and permitting further progress on  both bilateral and multilateral tracks of the Middle East peace  talks.

Al-Mu'ashshir even  hinted at a possible quid pro quo by Amman, noting that while a  final decision on the Arab boycott issue rested with the Arab  League, ""the secondary and tertiary boycott can be studied, and  ways can be worked out to deal with this matter"" (1 February).     In the wake of a subsequent lack of movement on the al-'Aqabah  issue, coupled with the mid-March UN Security Council renewal of  the economic embargo against Iraq, press editorials stepped up  their anti-U.S. rhetoric (Jordan Times 22 March, Al-Ra'y 21  March), and government resolve to deal decisively with the matter  crystallized.  Only hours before the arrival of U.S. special  envoy Dennis Ross in Amman, the Jordanian House of  Representatives issued a statement calling on the government to  suspend its role in the peace process ""until the U.S.-led  blockade on the Red Sea port of al-'Aqabah is actually lifted""  (Jordan Times, 23 March).  The highly charged atmosphere  surrounding the Ross visit was reflected in the press, which  noted coolly that while Ross said Washington would ""study""  Jordanian proposals to change the MIF procedures, he ""refused to  make any promises that these pressures would be lifted"" (Akhbar  al-Usbu', 24 March).      Government Signals Displeasure      In further indications of Jordanian displeasure with the slow  progress of negotiations on al-'Aqabah, the government chose to  cancel a high-level trip to Washington and lowered its level of  representation at various multilateral peace talks committee  meetings.  However, Jordan's decision to downgrade its  representatives at multilateral meetings--rather than boycott the  sessions altogether--signaled its reluctance to risk serious  disruption of the peace negotiations.     --In place of an official delegation, Amman sent an observer to  the 7 April multilateral talks on environmental issues ""because  we are still awaiting Washington's decision on the Port of al-  'Aqabah blockade,"" according to Foreign Ministry officials cited  by Al-Ra'y (7 April).     --Similarly, Jordan reduced its level of representation at the  Oman multilateral talks on water rights to observer status (Al-  Dustur, 17 April); in the previous four sessions of the water  committee, Amman had participated with a six-member official  delegation  (Amman Radio, 19 April).     --Crown Prince Hasan reportedly canceled a visit to Washington  scheduled for 20 April ""following the U.S.-Jordanian tension  resulting from the al-'Aqabah Port blockade""  (Al-Majd, 18  April).     --Amman declined to host a regional conference on economic  investment slated for 1O April that was to have included an  Israeli delegation (Al-Majd, 18 April).      Student Protest Underscores Domestic Discord      Reflecting one facet of the domestic pressures the government  faces on the issues of al-'Aqabah and the peace process from an  increasingly vocal press and public, the Jordan Times reported a  demonstration of between 500 and 1,000 University of Jordan  students against the al-'Aqabah inspections, noting that the  fundamentalist-oriented ""Islamic bloc"" dominated the event.  The  newspaper reported that the students called on the government to  ""withdraw from the peace process altogether"" (21-22 April).  They  also ""set fire to U.S. and Israeli flags,"" and ""raised posters  supporting His Majesty King Husayn's pan-Arab policies and  condemning Washington's arrogant policy,"" according to Akhbar al-  Usbu' (21 April).      Implications      The recent escalation in the number of al-'Aqabah inspections-  -and the accompanying public and press perception of the MIF  searches as being a form of U.S. political pressure--have posed  considerable challenges to the government's stated intent to  continue its active role in the peace process.  A modified  arrangement at al-'Aqabah that would ease the strain on the  domestic economy is clearly what Amman is seeking.  Such an  accommodation would likely go a long way toward easing internal  pressures on the government and permitting further progress on  both bilateral and multilateral tracks of the Middle East peace  talks.

In October last year, Burma's biggest ethnic rebel group,  the  Kachin Independence Army, made peace with the junta, or State  Law and Order Restoration Council (Slorc), and now the Karens,  the Mons and the Karennis along the Thai border have begun talks  with the central government.    The junta has benefited from being able to negotiate  separate  peace treaties with each rebel group, a process that also  resulted in the increasing marginalisation of Burman  pro-democracy groups who sought refuge in rebel strongholds.  While the patchwork peace process will probably result in a  cessation of hostilities for the time being, analysts say  fundamental differences between the Slorc and the rebels must  still be resolved before any long-term solution can be reached.    ""There's a fundamental difference between the Slorc's  perception of how to solve the ethnic issue and what the  minorities themselves have been demanding throughout the years  of civil war,"" a Rangoon-based analyst told the REVIEW. ""The  minorities and their Burma allies in the DAB (Democratic  Alliance of Burma) are basically advocating a modified version  of the federal system that existed before (the first military  coup in) 1962.    The Slorc, on the other hand, wants a system similar to  China's -- let the minorities do what they want within their  respective areas as long as they don't interfere with national  politics. Bring them to the capital dressed up in their  colourful costumes to attend conventions and congresses, but  don't let them have a say in the running of the country as a  whole.""    Rangoon's actions so far lend credence to this analysis.  When the first talks were held with the Kachins in the border  town of Panghsai near China in late 1991, the government  representative, Col. Kyaw Thein of the powerful intelligence  apparatus, stated clearly that he wanted a separate deal with  the Kachins only. He also referred to the Burman members of the  DAB -- various pro- democracy groups, student organisations and  an association of dissident Buddhist monks -- as ""a nuisance,""  indicating that they would not be part of the peace plan.    ""It's the pro-democracy movement that is the main enemy. The  strategy is to neutralise the ethnic groups in order to  eliminate what's left of the Burman opposition,"" another analyst  in Bangkok said.    If that is indeed the government's goal, it is succeeding.  Since late 1990, the Karen headquarters at Manerplaw has also  been the main base not only for dissident students, but also for  fugitive MPs, who were elected in May of that year but prevented  from assuming office, as well as numerous activists from what  was Burma's main prodemocracy party, the National League for  Democracy.    A number of recent events have effectively separated the  Burman opposition from the ethnic rebels at Manerplaw. The  current peace talks -- which the Burman dissidents are opposing  -- are only one example. In September last year, five leading  Burman activists left Manerplaw to travel to the United States  to lobby at the United Nations. They have been barred from  entering Thailand by security authorities in Bangkok, whose  connivance they would need to return to Manerplaw.    Thai participation in brokering the peace talks is evident  also in the pressure that has been placed on the ethnic rebels  to negotiate with Rangoon. The Mons were the first group along  the Thai border to strike a deal with the Slorc in late  December. The Karennis, who are closely related to the Karens,  met government representatives in their area in early January.  A meeting in the border areas also reportedly took place at  about the same time between the Karen rebel leader, Gen. Bo  Mya, and Lieut.-Col. Thein Swe, the Burmese defence attache in  Bangkok.    Originally, the DAB's stated policy was not to talk to  Rangoon's representatives individually but to insist on a  political settlement that included the entire front. Under Thai  pressure, this policy now appears to have been abandoned. ""But  even worse is that the ethnic groups lack any kind of  coordination. They're entering into these talks just to see  what the Slorc has to offer, not with a comprehensive,  coordinated agenda,"" a source close to the ethnic rebels said.     "

By NICK B. WILLIAMS Jr., TIMES STAFF WRITER      JERUSALEM      Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir has agreed to a compromise American formula for  selecting a Palestinian panel to preliminary peace talks, Israeli Television  reported Saturday night.    Acceptance by Shamir and his rightist Likud Party could revive the stalled  peace process and forestall a threat by the Labor Party, Likud's coalition  partner, to bolt the unity government.    ""Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir will give a positive response to the American  question on the composition of the Palestinian delegation, senior Likud and  Labor sources said this evening,"" the television report said.    The report was broadcast as Shamir and his loyal Cabinet ministers were  discussing the deadlock at the prime minister's home. There was no immediate  confirmation from the Likud leadership.    ""They (Israeli Television) must know more than we do,"" declared Avi Pazner,  Shamir's spokesman. ""I don't understand on what they base their report.""    ""We will see tomorrow (today),"" when Shamir is scheduled to meet with Labor  Party leaders, Pazner said.    Israeli Army Radio, in a later broadcast, also said Shamir would propose  acceptance of the American formula, a move bitterly opposed by the right wing  of his party. The opponents, led by former Industry and Commerce Minister Ariel  Sharon, reject any peace talks with Palestinians. Sharon's supporters in the  Cabinet boycotted the Saturday night talks.    The television report said Shamir's acceptance would be conditional on a pledge  by the Labor Party to withdraw its threat to leave the coalition if the  stalemate on the peace talks were not broken. ""We have to make our national  choice,"" Labor Party leader Shimon Peres said Friday, reasserting a Wednesday  deadline for a decision.    According to the report, the embattled prime minister agreed to accept a  delegation to preliminary peace talks of Palestinians registered as residents  of the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. Under the formula proposed by  Secretary of State James A. Baker III, that wording could include Palestinians  who had been deported from the occupied territories and those who keep an  apartment or office in East Jerusalem in addition to their home in the  territories.    But according to the television report, Shamir is accepting only the general  wording ""registered as residents,"" which may deflect some of the anticipated  opposition from the Likud right wing, Jewish settlers in the occupied  territories and other groups opposed to the peace process.    The Palestinian delegation would be selected at a proposed Washington meeting  of Baker, Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Arens and Egyptian Foreign Minister  Esmat Abdel Meguid. The Egyptians would front for Yasser Arafat's Palestine  Liberation Organization, with which the Israelis refuse to deal directly.  Israel would retain the right to reject any Palestinian candidate, the  television report said.    Selection of the delegation would be the first step in a long process toward  achieving a peace plan put forward by Shamir last April. The delegation would  work out with the Israelis the procedures for a later election of Palestinian  representatives. Talks between that group and the Israelis would determine the  future status of the occupied territories.    There have been no official talks between Israelis and Palestinians for more  than 20 years, since Israel conquered the occupied territories in the 1967  Arab-Israeli War.    Today's meeting of the so-called Forum of Four -- Shamir and Arens for Likud  and Deputy Prime Minister Peres and Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin for Labor --  will set the stage for a full Cabinet meeting on the peace talks issue  Wednesday. If the American formula is accepted by the Cabinet, Baker is  expected to issue invitations for the Washington meeting, putting the peace  process back on the rails.    The PLO has insisted, among other things, that the Palestinian delegation  include representatives from East Jerusalem, which was annexed by Israel after  the 1967 war. That issue has become the most explosive on the tortuous path to  the talks. Israeli rightists insist that including East Jerusalem Palestinians  in the delegation would raise questions about the legitimacy of the annexation.    Another longstanding PLO demand calls for the establishment of a Palestinian  state in the occupied territories, opposed by politicians in both Likud and  Labor.    The television report made no mention of the agenda of the proposed Washington  talks, beyond selection of the Palestinian delegation. The PLO has called for  an open-ended discussion of all issues once the Palestinian representatives are  chosen and sit down with their Israeli counterparts in what would be the first  meeting of the opposing sides on the confrontation that has racked the Middle  East for decades.    President Bush, asked about the report from Israel, said, ""We have been working  on this for eight months.""    Speaking at a news conference in California after his summit meeting with  Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, Bush said he had no details, but ""I hope  it's true and I hope we can move forward.""

Milosevic said that the offensive of the Bosnian Moslem army  had been going on for weeks before the very eyes of the  international public but that the United Nations had done  nothing to stop it, apart from a few mild warnings.    On the contrary, the Moslem enclave of Gorazde in eastern  Bosnia was used as a springboard for the offensive on Bosnian  Serb positions. By launching air strikes, the U.N. evidently  became involved in the civil war on the Bosnian Moslem side,  which is highly reprehensible and discredits the world  organization as a mediator in the peace process, he said.    U.S. NATO warplanes on Sunday and Monday bombed Bosnian Serb  positions around Gorazde, a Moslem enclave which should have  been demilitarized last spring as one of the six U.N. ""safe  areas.""    Late in March, around 10,000 Moslems, who had been massed in  Gorazde for the offensive, launched a strong offensive on Serb  territories.    After breaking the offensive, the Serb army made a strong  counter-attack and penetrated to a distance of several  kilometres close to the town.    Milosevic said that, in order to surmount the current  crisis,  it would be necessary to reach peace without prejudice  concerning political solutions, rather than to allow an  escalation of war. When there are no more armed conflicts,  political negotiations should be brought to an end, he said.    The Serbian president supported the resumed talks between  Knin and Zagreb and expressed satisfaction over the sucessful  implementation of the ceasefire agreement between the republic  of Serb Krajina (RSK) and Croatia.    The new phase of talks between the two sides, expected to  focus on normalization of economic ties, in itself touches the  problem of the sanctions, which are at this moment the biggest  obstacle to successful talks.    Undoubtedly, all factions who care for peace and an end of  the crisis hope that the talks between Knin and Zagreb would  result in restored economic and communication ties. However, it  is impossible to achieve that while one of the sides (Serb) is  constantly being exposed to sanctions of the international  community, which make such ties impossible, Milosevic said.    The international community and its public will therefore  face a choice of either supporting a normalization of relations  and peace or, through the implementation of the sanctions,  insisting on confrontation.    In that case, the sanctions would be the biggest obstacle to  the peace process and a normalization of relations, Milosevic  said and added that he expected the forces of peace and  cooperation to overwhelm the advocators of war and prolonged  crisis.    The RSK was proclaimed in 1991 in the Serb ethnic and  historical territories within the administrative borders of the  former Yugoslav Republic of Croatia in response to Croatia's  violent secession from the former Yugoslav federation and the  downgrading of the Serbs' status to that of an ethnic minority.    In March 1992, the RSK territory was proclaimed a United  Nations protected area (UNPA).    The talks between Milosevic and Churkin were also attended  by  Yugoslav Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic and Russian  Ambassador in Belgrade Gennadiy Shikin.     "

The sources told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the visit will take  place in the second half of next April. They said that the  meeting will be of some importance at Arab and international  levels in view of the international changes and their effect on  the region and also because of the peace process and its  possible results.    The sources added that the Syrian-Iranian summit will also  cover the Geneva summit results and President Hafiz al-Asad's  talks with U.S. President Bill Clinton on peace affairs and the  region, the Gulf, the situation in Iran, and Iran's relations  with other states. They said that al-Asad might mediate between  Iran and Algeria in an attempt to improve relations.  Syrian-Iranian relations are believed to be strategic. They  have been allies with special ties characterized by depth and  continuity. Iran realizes to what extent these constant  relations with Syria have enhanced Iran's relations with the  Arab world and especially the Gulf states. President al-Asad's  clear pan-Arab policies have succeeded in settling more than one  dispute between Arab states and Iran, including the dispute with  the United Arab Emirates [UAE] over the three islands and  problems in Iran's relations with some Arab states such as Egypt  and Algeria. The sources said that President al-Asad will  convey to President Rafsanjani Egypt's desire to eliminate the  obstacles standing in the way of the improvement of its  relations with Iran.    The sources further said that the al-Asad-Rafsanjani summit  agenda will be full of topical issues, especially regional,  Islamic, and international issues, extraordinary developments  affecting these issues, and other matters of mutual interest, in  addition to the situation in the Gulf, Lebanon, the Palestinian  question, and the effects of the separate Palestinian-Israeli  agreements on the peace process. On the situation in southern  Lebanon, the Syrian and Iranian sides will reaffirm continued  support for the Islamic and national resistance for the  expulsion of the Israeli forces and the liberation of the south.    The summit talks will cover the situation in Iraqi and the  position of the Kurds, particularly in view of the recent change  in that position. Iran is worried about the main Kurdish  parties in the region, especially those which have close links  with the West. Iran and Syria have emphasized in past joint  statements that what happens in Iraq is an internal affair and  something for the Iraqi people to resolve. The two sides will  also review Arab-Turkish relations and the tense situation in  the Kurdish areas of Turkey.    President Rafsanjani has stressed that Iran and Syria are  opposed to any violation of Iraqi territorial integrity and  Palestinian rights.    This will be al-Asad's second visit of its kind to Iran. He  visited Tehran in September 1990.    President Rafsanjani paid his first visit to Syria as  Iranian  president in April 1991. He held talks described at the time as  very successful.    Political observers believe that Syria's participation in  the  peace negotiations with Israel, which Iran strongly opposes, has  not resulted in any Syrian-Iranian misunderstanding and that  Iran's position on this is that it is a matter related to  Syria's views on the issues of peace and the Arab-Israeli  conflict. Iranian Foreign Minister Dr. 'Ali Akbar Velayati has  stated that his country would not have a dispute with such  states as Syria, with whom it enjoys solid and close relations,  over the question of peace agreement. Iran believes that  Damascus is coming under massive pressure to sign a peace  agreement with Israel, and Iran has told Syria that it is  opposed to such an agreement and to anything to do with peace  with Israel.    President al-Asad has said that both countries share the  same  views on Lebanon and both have long supported Lebanon's unity.    Syrian sources say that President Hafiz al-Asad's visit to  Tehran will further enhance Syrian-Iranian relations and raise  them to a more special level, particularly in economic and  cultural fields.

Mr Peres flew in from Jerusalem in a military helicopter to become the first Israeli cabinet minister to be received openly in the kingdom. 'It took us 15 minutes to fly over but 46 years to arrive to this place of peace and promise,' he said on arrival. The talks are the fifth in a series of trilateral negotiations which began last October to focus on areas of economic and infrastructural co-operation between Jordan and Israel. They come a day after the close of bilateral border talks on land and water rights and less than a week before Jordan's King Hussein is due to meet Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, in Washington. All three parties emphasised the historical importance of the meeting, saying it was a critical step on the path towards peace between the two countries. Mr Peres said that a similar meeting had been suggested six months ago but 'at the time seemed an impossibility'. Mr Christopher said that now the ice had been broken, 'high-level negotiations could take place regularly.' But having just arrived from Damascus he was careful to stress that progress on the Jordanian track would not be to the exclusion of Syria, where he is due to return tomorrow. Mr Peres described the planned summit between the Jordanian king and Israeli premier as 'the start of a new era' in Jordanian-Israeli relations, and Mr Majali, who was acting in his role as foreign minister, did not rule out the signing of some kind of agreement or declaration in Washington. However, he warned against optimism that a full peace treaty between the two sides would be signed soon. Instead, peace would come in stages: 'Like a book, the peace will come in chapters. Only when all the chapters have been written can a full peace treaty be signed. Although this is not to say that along the way each chapter can be put into practice,' he said. Earlier in the day, King Hussein said: 'I hope to sign as soon as it is possible. But not next week.' Concrete agreements at the end of the talks were limited to further studies on future projects and economic co-operation, including: A master plan to develop the Jordan Valley into a joint national heritage park. A study of aviation routes to benefit both countries. A commission to promote tourism which will include opening a crossing-point between Aqaba and Eilat, on the Red Sea, for third-country nationals. A site survey for a road linking Jordan, Israel and Egypt along the Gulf of Aqaba. Mr Peres spoke optimistically of open borders, trade and skies in the future where 'farms replace soldiers and greenhouses replace army barracks.' He said that the border dispute in which Israel occupies around 380 square kilometres of Jordanian land was near resolution; 'We can mark out (the border) now while respecting the sovereignty of both sides,' he said.

Although both sides spoke optimistically of resuming talks next week, it is unlikely the two sides can reach agreement on implementing Palestinian self-rule in the Gaza strip and West Bank area of Jericho this month. Fears for the peace accord rose this week as Mr Binyamin Netanyahu, leader of the opposition right-wing Likud party, said he would not honour the agreement if his party was elected to power because he considered the PLO to have reneged on its commitments under the accord. Mr Netanyahu's statement, which reversed an earlier commitment by Likud to stand by the agreement, was intended to encourage opposition to the peace accord and increase pressure on Mr Rabin to open a dialogue with Likud. After an intense series of contacts by telephone and fax and a last minute minor compromise by Jerusalem on the issue of borders, PLO and Israeli officials said they were prepared to restart negotiations in the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Taba next week. However Mr Rabin said a final decision would only be taken today once Israel was certain the PLO had accepted the rules and limits of negotiations. Israeli officials said resumption of the talks was possible after the PLO dropped several demands intended to increase the symbolic sovereignty of Palestinian self-rule and after Israel agreed to meet one PLO demand for the presence of Palestinian flags and policemen at the Jordanian-West Bank border.

In a scarcely disguised rebuke, Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, said he had been 'surprised' by comments by Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister. Speaking after a meeting of the Anglo-Irish conference, Sir Patrick said Mr Spring had apparently gone beyond the 'cardinal principle' that the constitutional future of Northern Ireland would have to be agreed by the province's population and political leaders. But Mr Spring said that it would be wrong for any option for Northern Ireland to be ruled out: 'If we are not allowed to put forward provocative ideas then we may as well all give up.' Irish officials said privately that the two governments had to be prepared for the possible failure of 'round-table' talks on the province. Mr Spring said that 'ultimately, responsibility lies with governments and I think that the governments have to make that quite clear'. The row reflected growing frustration in London and Dublin at the failure of the two governments to restart the talks involving Northern Ireland's main political leaders, which collapsed last November. Unionists say they will not re-enter until the Irish Republic modifies its constitutional claim on the north. Although his row with Mr Spring lowered still further the chances of talks resuming, Sir Patrick again refused to give up yesterday, saying: 'I don't visualise this process failing.' However, Mr Spring, while still commited to 'round-table' talks, has raised the possibility of the two governments going over the heads of local politicians and agreeing a political framework for the province, which might be put to referendums in Northern Ireland and the south. He said options could include shared authority or sovereignty of the province - both under consideration by the UK Labour party. But Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, and Sir Patrick have rejected such proposals.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.     IEZ  Ireland, EC.

Egypt, the only Arab state to have made peace with Israel, appears to be playing a key mediating role in background diplomacy aimed at fulfilling a stated US desire for Syria, Lebanon and Jordan to conclude outline agreements with Israel as part of a comprehensive deal under the terms of the present Middle East peace talks. The US has nominated September 13 for a possible signing ceremony and indicated it could be held at the White House if Syria, Jordan and Lebanon were also placed to join the Palestinians in concluding accords with the Israelis. But Syria and Lebanon both indicated yesterday that this date appeared optimistic. Mr Farouk al-Sharaa, Syrian foreign minister, told reporters in Beirut there had been 'nothing new on the Syrian path' of the negotiations in Washington during the present round. Mr Faris Bouez, his Lebanese counterpart, also said that 'we cannot say there is any progress compared with the previous rounds'. One indication of the intensified diplomatic manoeuvring was the decision of King Hussein of Jordan to postpone a visit to China early next week. A palace spokesman cited a flurry of activity on the Middle East peace front as a reason for the postponement. Mr Arafat held talks in Cairo yesterday with Mr Amr Moussa, the Egyptian foreign minister, after his arrival from Damascus. The two sides are believed to have focused on ways of shoring up Arab support for the PLO agreement with Israel. Arab officials said a statement of support for the Israel-Palestinian deal by the Gulf Co-operation Council, representing six Gulf states, was significant since it ensured a majority within the Arab League for the peace deal. Gulf foreign ministers meeting in Riyadh said the GCC continued to 'support peace efforts. . . in the hope that (Arab-Israeli) negotiations would make substantive progress along all tracks to push the peace process forward.' This was a reference to parallel talks between Israel and Syria, Lebanon and Jordan. On his arrival in Cairo yesterday, Mr Arafat denied that Syrian endorsement for the plan had been lukewarm. He described his talks on Sunday with Syrian President Hafez al-Assad as 'brotherly, warm and dignified'. He told reporters: 'I have thanked President Assad for the meeting, for his understanding and for all the advice he has given, especially in this atmosphere and the developments that the Palestinian and Arab cause is passing through.'

He  called on the cosponsors of the peace process to shoulder their  responsibilities in providing security for the Palestinian  people.    He added that allowing the massacre to pass without  punishment could undermine the peace efforts in the area.  Referring to the racist tendencies in the Israeli Government  itself, he said that the Israeli Government's actions are  characterized by violence against the Palestinians, and that the  massacre has exposed Israel's claim to be a democratic country.    Qaddumi affirmed that the PLO is committed to peace, but is  not prepared to resume the peace talks under these conditions  and until tangible measures are taken to protect the Palestinian  people in the occupied territories.    He said that the massacre has singled out the problem of the  settlements as a time bomb that does not help advance the peace  process.    Qaddumi expressed regret at the recent U.S. position at the  UN Security Council regarding the status of Jerusalem, saying it  causes concern. He affirmed that the Palestinian people are  ready to make sacrifices in order to ensure their legitimate  rights, no matter how long this takes.     "

The paper says that the Arabs have done everything to render  the Washington talks successful. They have offered the  establishment of a just, comprehensive, and durable genuine  peace in the Middle East. However, Israel's response has always  been the intensification of the settlement activity, arming of  settlers, and urging them to commit crimes and destroy Arab  property and houses.    The paper explains that the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre and the  subsequent events are the natural outcome of the Rabin  government's policy of arming settlers and deploying armed  settler patrols throughout the occupied territories. The Rabin  government has ignored their crimes and threats to expel the  Arabs from their homeland en masse. In the same vein, the Rabin  government expanded settlements and allocated large funds from  the U.S. loan guarantees to build new settlements. It also  forced the Palestinian side to accept keeping the settlements in  Gaza and Jericho, where they will act as hotbeds of aggression  and a sword brandished against the Palestinians.    TISHRIN says that Israel is responsible for all crimes and  for the obstruction of the Washington talks. The international  community is dutybound to protect the Palestinian people against  Zionist terrorism. It should compel Israel to comply with the  requirements of peace so that peace may prevail. Such  requirements necessitate full withdrawal by both the army and  settlers from the occupied Arab territories.    For its part, AL-BA'TH stresses in a commentary that the  campaigns of denunciation of the occupation's crimes and glaring  hostility to peace cannot be useful unless these campaigns are  translated into practical pressures to curb Israel's defiance of  the international community, which is looking forward to peace  in this region.    The paper says: Therefore, practical steps must be taken to  prompt the Rabin government to declare its explicit compliance  with the bases of the peace process, so that the bilateral talks  may resume. The paper stresses that otherwise, the peace  efforts will continue to revolve in a vicious circle and the  occupation crimes will continue indefinitely.    AL-THAWRAH indicates that the sinful hands that shed the  blood of our children and brothers in occupied Palestine and  Lebanon are the same hands. Moreover, the fingers and even the  fingerprints are the same. The paper says that even police dogs  could trace the perpetrator and the criminal who masterminded  the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre and the explosion at the Sayyidat  al-Najat Church in Lebanon.    In a comment, the paper asks: Besides condemnation and  denunciation, what will the international community do to stop  the Zionists' crimes? What will it do to curb this racist Nazi  Zionist ghoul?    The paper says that the UN Security Council has an  opportunity now to prove that it is truly a council for  defending the security of those who need it. The UN Security  Council should defend the defenseless Palestinian people from  the ferocious and horrible Israeli machine of aggression, the  paper notes. The UN Security Council's responsibility today is  immense, historic, crucial, and doubled.    The paper adds that the UN Security Council faces major  challenges, especially with regard to safeguarding the peace  process, at whose tables Israel is committing peace massacres  that are not less appalling than its bloody massacres. It has a  responsibility toward protecting the Palestinian people against  the Zionist terrorism. The biggest responsibility and the  biggest challenge is to safeguard the entire international  security against the dangers of Zionism and racism, which thrive  on rivers of blood.     "

Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, telephoned Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO leader, and held him responsible for the safe return of the soldier, Corporal Nachshon Waxman, who was kidnapped by the fundamentalist Hamas group. The head of the Israeli delegation to the peace talks in Cairo, where negotiations are under way over Palestinian elections, was recalled. In Jerusalem Mr Rabin held talks wiith security officials and an emergency cabinet session was called for today. The incident, which comes amid reports that Mr Arafat and Mr Rabin are to receive the Nobel Peace Prize, marks one of the most serious political crises since Palestinian autonomy was established in May after Israel pulled out of the Gaza Strip and West Bank town of Jericho. It follows warnings by Mr Rabin to Mr Arafat to crack down on Islamic fundamentalists, who oppose peace with the Jewish state. Mr Arafat has refrained from confronting the fundamentalists, fearing that any attempt to disarm them or arrest their leaders would result in a civil war. Hamas said it would kill the soldier unless Israel released a number of Moslem militant leaders being held prisoner by Friday. Mr Rabin's office warned that 'any harm to the soldier kidnapped by the Hamas or delay in the return of the soldier is likely to have a very detrimental effect on the future relations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority, and the continuation of the peace process'. 'This is the true test for the Palestinian Authority,' Mr Rabin told Mr Arafat. It was the second time that Israel has sealed off the Gaza Strip, barring Palestinian workers from getting to their jobs in Israel, since autonomy began. The move puts additional pressure on Mr Arafat as the 50,000 workers are the main breadwinners for the impoverished coastal strip. In Gaza, Mr Arafat condemned the kidnapping and accused Hamas of provocation. He spoke to the parents of the kidnapped soldier and promised to do his best to win the release of their son, said his spokesman, Mr Nabil Abuirdeineh. Israel radio reported that Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state who is brokering peace between Israel and Syria, telephoned both Mr Rabin and Mr Arafat over the developments.

0,FT934-4051 ,"FT934-4051 _AN-DLFC8AC2FT 931206   FT  06 DEC 93 / PLO leadership rift widens as deadline nears on Israel talks      By JULIAN OZANNE      JERUSALEM   Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation resumed talks in Cairo yesterday amid a growing PLO leadership rift and recognition that the start of Israel's military withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho will be delayed. The crisis in the PLO's upper ranks deepened after Mr Mahmoud Abbas (also known as Abu Mazen), the man who signed the Israeli-Palestinian peace accord in Washington, refused to participate in a newly formed PLO committee set up to avert criticism of Mr Yassir Arafat's handling of the peace talks. With only seven days left before Israel and the PLO were supposed, under the terms of the peace accord, to sign a protocol marking the start of a four-month troop withdrawal, the two sides remain deeply divided on a complex set of issues. The talks, being held at a secret location in Cairo, have yet to agree the size of the Jericho area; who should control the border crossings between Jericho and Jordan and between Gaza and Egypt; the extent of the troop withdrawal; security arrangements for Israeli settlers; and the timetable for further releases of up to 10,000 Palestinian prisoners being held by Israel. The PLO has until now insisted on keeping the December 13 deadline, being under pressure to deliver results to increasingly sceptical Palestinians. But there were signs yesterday that it was prepared to accept a two-week delay. Mr Nabil Shaath, the chief PLO negotiator, said the organisation was sparing no effort to finish on time in spite of recent comments by Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, suggesting the need for a delay. But Mr Shaath accepted that Israeli reservations about the progress in the talks might force a delay. In Amman, PLO officials said Mr Arafat, PLO chairman, had told the central committee of his Fatah faction that he was reluctantly prepared for a two-week delay in the face of Israeli intransigence on key issues. Palestinians say any delay will arouse suspicions about Israeli intentions and fuel violence by extremists on both sides. The delay will further deepen the PLO leadership crisis. Criticism of Mr Arafat's handling of the peace negotiations has solidified around three senior PLO officials - Mr Abbas, Mr Yassir Abed-Rabbo and Mr Suleiman Najjab. All three are members of the 12-strong PLO executive committee and have been among the most important voices for peace and moderation within the PLO, backing Mr Arafat against more extremist factions. Mr Ahmed Qurie (Abu Ala), the PLO's chief economics negotiator, is also said to have supported the campaign to force Mr Arafat to democratise the PLO, bring in professionals from outside the organisation and allow the PLO's senior officials a greater say in policymaking. In a move to quell the criticism, Mr Arafat had asked Mr Abbas to head a PLO committee to direct detailed peace talks with Israel. Mr Abbas refused the appointment and said he would have nothing to do with the committee. Crackdown threatened for Jewish settlers Page 4   Countries:-  ILZ  Israel, Middle East.

Mr John Major, the prime minister, told the Commons that the proposals would give 'focus and direction' to the so-called three-strand talks, which collapsed last year when the Unionist parties walked out. Mr Major gave no details of the peace plan, but Downing Street said it was an attempt to bring about a permanent settlement of the Northern Ireland conflict. The plan is believed to focus on the establishment of a Northern Ireland assembly and the revitalisation of local government, which has been moribund since the imposition of direct rule in 1974. It also builds on the agreement between the British and Irish governments in Brussels last week, which set out a framework for talks with all Northern Ireland parties except Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA. The plan is aimed largely at the Ulster Unionists, who have long pressed for devolution from Westminster to remove control of the province from the Northern Ireland Office. Initial reaction from Unionists suggested that the government may have to offer further concessions to tempt the parties back to the negotiating table. The Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the hardline Democratic Unionist party, last night warned the prime minister that further talks with the Irish government, due to take place tomorrow in Belfast, could 'bring yet further outrages'. In a letter to Mr Major, Mr Paisley says: 'I implore you to hold it elsewhere.' He believes further talks with the Irish government would inflame the Protestant community. He said that he would agree to talks with the Irish government only if it gave up its constitutional claim to a united Ireland. Mr Paisley said Mr Major had agreed to meet him soon. Mr John Taylor, Europe spokesman for the Ulster Unionist party, the biggest Unionist grouping, welcomed the prospect of fresh proposals but dismissed the round-table format as 'flawed'. He called for the plan to be discussed in a series of bilateral meetings between the government and the constitutional parties. Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, appeared willing to go along with that approach last night. Sir Patrick said the peace process could resume with 'bilateral private discussions to clear things out of the way, bank what is bankable from last time, and to see what ultimately is a really serious obstacle. Then may be the time to sit round the table'. Ministers were also drawing comfort from the measured response of Mr James Molyneaux, the UUP leader, who plans to take wide soundings among UUP members before commenting later this week. Mr Major's decision to offer a fresh incentive to the Unionists to reopen round-table talks marks the end of any prospects for progress on the joint proposals produced by Mr John Hume, leader of the constitutional nationalist SDLP, and Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein. Mr Major yesterday accepted a request from Mr Hume for a meeting at Downing Street to discuss the proposals, but the government has ruled out even indirect contact with Sinn Fein until the IRA declares an unconditional ceasefire. In Belfast, Mr Adams attempted to resuscitate the Hume-Adams proposals by issuing a statement asserting that 'the leadership of the IRA welcomed the initiative and pointed out that it could provide the basis for peace'.

The two sides discussed the trend of the  Middle East peace talks during their half-hour meeting at the  White House, which took place on the invitation of the U.S.  President.    King Husayn's private visit to the U.S. is taking place at a  time when the Jordanian government delegation, during its June 7  meeting with the Zionist regime delegation in Washington,  reached agreements on defining the border lines, sharing water  and economic issues. The agreements were reached during the  presence of the U.S. representatives. Meanwhile King Husayn has  also recently announced his willingness to meet the Israeli  prime minister, Yitzhaq Rabin, and bilateral talks are expected  to be held in Amman and Tel Aviv next month.    According to political experts, the fresh Amman-Tel Aviv  agreement has come along with the U.S. and the Zionist regime's  designs to create division among the ranks of the Arab  countries. The Israeli regime in the wake of the Gaza-Ariha  [Jericho] accord, which was signed last September, and in view  of the opposition expressed by certain regional countries, has  been trying to create division among the Arabs through different  means and with backing of the U.S. In this connection one of  the ways that the main ally of the U.S. -- that is, Israel -- is  pursuing is to strike separate deals with each of the Arab  countries secretly.    From the outset of the Madrid peace talks, the Zionist  regime  has tried to break the framework of the negotiations and have  separate accords with each one of the Arab sides. The  Gaza-Ariha accord was the first step taken in this regard and  the recent accord between Jordan and Israel can be cited as  being part of the same continuing trend. Political analysts  believe that the continuation of such a trend is considered to  be an all-sided pressure that Israel and the United States are  putting on the other parties in the peace talks that do not  agree with the trend. Therefore, although King Husayn is  visiting the United States with the aim of activating the trend  of peace talks with Israel, the trend of developments,  especially during the recent months, speaks of conditions that  favor Tel Aviv.    As a matter of fact what is being shaped is the continuation  of the trend of compromise in which Israel will be taking more  and more concessions from the Arabs.     "

An increasing cycle of tit-for-tat violence by Israeli and Palestinian extremists, united in their desire to sabotage the peace process, has overshadowed the visit by Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, who yesterday vowed to 'energise' stalled peace talks between Syria and Israel. Over the weekend, Israeli settlers living around occupied Hebron shot into crowds of Palestinians, some of whom were throwing rocks. In another incident, a settler fired at an Arab taxi. At least six Palestinians were wounded in the weekend violence in Hebron and one died yesterday in hospital. In an apparent revenge attack, a Palestinian guerrilla belonging to the extremist Islamic Jihad group yesterday attacked a bus near Tel Aviv. One Israeli wounded in the battle later died in hospital and the guerrilla was shot dead by Israeli soldiers. Crowds of Israeli's gathered around the Palestinian's body shouting 'Death to Arabs'. Since the Israeli-Palestinian peace accord was signed in September at least 33 Palestinians and 15 Israelis have been killed. Cabinet ministers, many of whom have criticised the government for not taking firmer measures, attacked the wave of violence by settlers, accusing them of terrorism, murder and other illegal acts to disrupt the peace process. Mr Moshe Shahal, police minister, and Gen Ehud Barak, army chief of staff, promised tougher measures to curb settler violence and the use of force against law-breakers. Other ministers threatened to review the right of settlers to carry weapons. At least five settlers involved in the weekend incidents in Hebron were arrested and police officials said they were looking for others. Mr Christopher, who flew to Damascus yesterday for talks with President Hafez al-Assad of Syria, called for an end to the violence but made it clear that he was concentrating his Middle East shuttle diplomacy on trying to achieve a breakthrough in stalled talks between Israel and Syria over the Golan Heights, occupied by Israel since 1967. Mr Christopher, who hopes to carry messages between Damascus and Jerusalem, was expected to offer Mr Assad an improvement in ties with the US in return for concessions to Israel and a written Syrian clarification of the nature of peace with Israel it envisions. He flies to Amman today to meet King Hussein of Jordan and Mr Yassir Arafat, Palestine Liberation Organisation leader. Tomorrow he will hold a second round of meetings with Israeli leaders before considering a possible second trip to Damascus.   Countries:-  ILZ  Israel, Middle East.

We also discussed the UNPA [UN  Protected Areas] in Croatia, Mr. Hogg said. We did not discuss  Brcko, since our talks did not go into details. I agree with  increasing the number of military observers in the northern part  of Bosnia, Hogg said. I did not arrive with a concrete plan, he  said, but I did come with two important messages. The first one  is the vital importance of an unconditional cease-fire, and the  other one is the recognition of the importance of an overall  peace solution for Bosnia, to be based on the partition of the  territory on the basis of 49 percent to 51 percent. As you  know, this has been under discussion, Hogg said. Hogg also said  that there would be no alleviation of the sanctions until the  war was over and until the peace plan was implemented.    This is how FRY Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic  assessed  the talks between Douglas Hogg and President Milosevic:    [Jovanovic] You see, these talks referred to the topics that  Mr. Hogg mentioned, that is, the situation in Bosnia and the  negotiations with Krajina, and the situation in Kosovo was also  mentioned. We focused on the most current issues. The minister  has already mentioned that it was the work of the contact group  that was the most important, then the need to conclude an  agreement on the cease-fire. We also discussed the great need  and the common interest in negotiations for a political  solution. We agreed that the work of the contact group was very  important and that there was a need for an immediate cessation  of hostilities. The political negotiations have to follow  immediately afterwards. There was not much talk about details.  Mr. Hogg mentioned that there was a need for a 51 percent to 49  percent division. That is not a problem that should halt  negotiations and the cease-fire at the moment.    On the other hand, we pointed to the problem of the  sanctions  that are an absolute problem, which are not only the generator  of the crisis and other problems but also a main obstacle to the  implementation of any political solution, be it for Bosnia or  Krajina, or the Yugoslav space in general. We found the common  ground there that it was vital to remove obstacles on one party  to the implementation of the future political solution.  However, we could not discuss when and how, because as the  minister pointed out, the common stand of the Western countries  is that for the time being -- until the peace agreement is  reached on Bosnia-Herzegovina -- there can be no talk about the  lifting of the sanctions.    However, we pointed out that the sanctions were a form of  hostilities that relate to the entire Serbian nations, not just  to us in Yugoslavia, and that parallel to the cessation of  hostilities in Bosnia-Herzegovina it was necessary to refer to  the need to end other forms of hostilities. The sanctions are  one of these. The media war and the one-sided approach by the  international community to the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina and  the Yugoslav crisis in general is another form of hostility. It  is impossible to stop military hostilities and maintain the  economic and propaganda pressure, as well as psychological and  other forms of hostilities.    We believe that after these talks that all those who are  interested in peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the crisis in  Yugoslavia will better understand the need for one revised  approach to the Bosnian and the Yugoslav crisis -- which is to  remove the unequal treatment of the participants in the Yugoslav  crisis, and particularly the biased approach -- that this would  provide a quick movement forward toward peace and the  stabilization of the entire situation in the Balkans.

Delegation spokeswoman Ms Hanan Ashrawi said all 28 members turned back from the Allenby Bridge in protest after Israeli border guards prevented the five from crossing into Jordan from the occupied West Bank. She said the Palestinian delegation would refuse to leave for Washington until it received guarantees its members would be treated with dignity, even if this meant delaying the start of the talks set for Monday. Israeli authorities prevented the five from crossing because they were under age 35 and did not have a special permit allowing them to return immediately.  The Financial Times   London Page 3  "

[passage omitted]    ""Since the beginning of this year (1993), we have come under  increasing pressure from some Thai sources, most probably in the  line with the Thai government policy of constructive engagement  with Slorc,"" leaders of the three ethnic groups said in a signed  joint letter to one of Thailand's highest institutions.    ""Some forms of pressure involve the threat to push our  refugees back into the war zone or cut off food supplies, and  restricting our travel for medical treatment ...    ""Our understanding is that for positive or constructive  results, pressure should be applied equally to both sides.    ""Actions perceived as not evenhanded could only be  counter-productive,"" they said.    A copy of the Dec 3 letter signed by Karen leader Gen Bo  Mya,  Karenni leader Saw Maw Reh and Mon leader Nai Shwe Kyin was  obtained by THE NATION. [passage omitted]    According to well-informed border sources, the Mon and Slorc  agreed at a meeting late last year in Moulmein, in Burma's Mon  State, to an ""unofficial"" or ""loose truce deal"". The deal  effectively ends the fighting in southern Burma's Thaton, Mergui  and Tavoy areas.    Several more rounds of talks are needed to finalise details  before an actual truce agreement can be concluded, said the  sources.    Burmese southern commander Maj Gen Ket Sein headed the  Burmese negotiating team while Nai Htaw Mon a senior military  affairs officer, led the Mon delegation to the Moulmein meeting.    Meanwhile, the Karenni have delegated a three-member mission  to meet Slorc officials this week, according to a senior Karenni  leader, Abel Tweed.    He said Karenni Deputy Army Chief Maj Aung Mya will head the  team, which also includes Karenni officials Paulu and Shan Reh,  to a ""preliminary meeting"" in Daw Gnew Khu, a small border  village of about two-days walk from the Thai border.    Tweed said no agenda has been set. The forum will look into  the possibilities of further talks.    Tweed conceded that the bilateral talks could eventually  lead  to a military ceasefire, but said the Karenni National  Progressive Party has not abandoned its political objective of  an independent Karenni state.    He expressed the hope that future peace talks would be held  in Thailand, and said the Karenni mistrust Slorc too much to  ever go to Rangoon.    ""They (Slorc) refused to meet in Bangkok or Chiang Mai but  if  there is some progress from the (first) meeting then we may have  the next talks in Thailand... Thai authorities are willing to  host peace talks either in Chiang Mai or Mae Hong Son if both  sides agree,"" said Tweed.    Sources said the Burmese armed forces attache in Bangkok,  Col  Thein Swe, travelled to Mae Hong Son at the end of last year to  propose that the two sides meet.    As for the Karen, their leader Gen Bo Mya sent a letter last  week to Prime Minister Chuan Likphai urging the Thai government  to ""persuade"" or ""pressure"" Slorc to enter into a peace dialogue  with the collective ethnic opposition.    An informed border source said that the Karen group has  finally agreed to meet Rangoon officials to seek out common  ground for further truce negotiations.    The source said the group has already appointed a team to  engage in ""preliminary talks"" with Slorc.    It was not known when they will meet. The source added that  Gen Bo Mya at a meeting last Friday with a senior Thai security  general urged Thailand to host the Karen-Slorc talks.    Bo Mya sent a similar letter, which bears his title as  chairman of the Democratic Alliance of Burma (DAB), to Foreign  Minister Prasong Sunsiri and Interior Minister Gen Chawalit  Yongchaiyut. [passage omitted]    In his letter, Bo Mya accused Slorc of trying to disunite  the  opposition and warned Rangoon's policy of approaching individual  groups would not lead to ""a stable peace"" or a ""comprehensive  solution"" to the problems in Burma.    ""Slorc's insistence, needless to say, could only be viewed  as  a crude attempt to divide the resistance forces and, at the same  time, to improve its international image,"" he said.    ""Moreover, Slorc's approach would never lead to a stable  peace as desired by the people, and a comprehensive solution to  the problems besetting the country.    ""Whatever the circumstances, the DAB is the only  organisation  that can bring about general reconciliation and peace in the  whole country.    ""If you have the means to persuade or make pressure bear on  Slorc, we would like to urge you to use it for the emergence of  a peace negotiation between the Slorc and the DAB as a whole,""  said the Karen leader.

They ridiculed the Israeli plan for Palestinian self-rule presented on Monday, calling it an attempt to negate the whole purpose of the peace process. Israel planned to bring in the first of its experts yesterday to analyse issues involved in its proposals for interim self-governing arrangements in the West Bank and Gaza. Mrs Hanan Ashrawi, spokeswoman for the Palestinian delegation, said the scheme put forward by Israel was a tactic to use the peace process to reorganise the occupation. By proposing two separate legal systems for the West Bank and Gaza, for Jewish settlers and Palestinians, Israel was trying to legitimise the annexation of the territories and set up a formal apartheid system. Efforts are continuing in Washington to find a formula allowing Israel access to Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5.7bn) loan guarantees requested to settle immigrants from the former Soviet Union.

If there is no agreement on a fresh coalition in the next few days, Mr Reynolds, as acting prime minister, will have no choice but to seek an early election.

Mr Radovan Karadzic, Bosnian Serb leader, told the nine-man delegation, which also includes United Nations and European envoys, that UN sanctions on Belgrade must be lifted to make any progress towards an overall settlement, said his spokesman, Mr John Zametica. 'The international community has to decide if it is more important to maintain sanctions or achieve peace,' he said in Pale, the makeshift Serb capital near Sarajevo. The contact group, headed by Mr Charles Redman, the US special envoy, and, Mr Aleksei Nikiforov, the Russian representative, held the first face-to-face meeting with Bosnian Serb leaders since their forces complied with a Nato ultimatum on Wednesday to withdraw from a 20km exclusion zone round Gorazde, the embattled Moslem enclave which is designated a UN safe area. The group was due to return to Sarajevo for more talks with the Moslem-led Bosnian government. On Thursday, Mr Alija Izetbegovic, the Bosnian president, said he would consider a two to three month ceasefire to allow the peace talks to take place. Bosnian Serb leaders were likely to reject the offer. They claim the Bosnian army is preparing to launch an offensive on the northern Serb corridor linking Belgrade with Serb-held territory in Bosnia and Croatia. A senior US official yesterday said Bosnian Serb forces had moved their weapons from Gorazde northwards to the corridor. This heightens fears that Serbs will soon try to widen the corridor. Bosnian and Serbian media yesterday reported fighting around Brcko, at the eastern end of the corridor. Serb leaders have called for a complete cessation of hostilities in a bid to cement their military gains. Their forces control about 70 per cent of the war-ravaged republic. The attempt to revive the peace process also included talks in Norway between Lord Owen, the EU mediator, Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, the UN mediator and Mr Vitaly Churkin, the Russian special envoy. 'The crisis has created new possibilities,' Mr Stoltenberg said. 'We have a stability and calm in Bosnia for the moment which we have not had for a long time.' Mr Stoltenberg said the only chance for a formal end of the fighting and a peace accord soon was agreement between the US, Russia, France, Germany and Britain and the United Nations, The mediators discussed preparations for a meeting of foreign ministers from the five nations along with the United Nations. Meanwhile, Croatia yesterday accused Serb forces of violating the international agreement to withdraw from a 20km zone along the 1,600km confrontation line in Croatia.

The meetings will address the extension of Palestinian self rule from Gaza-Jericho to the rest of the West Bank and Palestinian national elections. The summit between Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and PLO Chairman Yassir Arafat followed recent attacks in which each side accused the other of failing to live up to the pledges of their peace accords. The PLO said Israel had reneged on promises to release Palestinian prisoners and is delaying implementing extension of self-rule from Gaza-Jericho across the rest of the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Mr Arafat was furious when Israel signed an interim peace deal with Jordan and recognised King Hussein's special role as guardian of Islamic sites in future talks over Jerusalem. The PLO claims occupied Arab East Jerusalem as its political capital. Israel in turn accused the PLO of not containing violence against Israeli soldiers who remain in Gaza. Israeli officials said Mr Warren Christopher, US Secretary of State, who met Mr Rabin and Mr Arafat during his regional shuttle earlier this week, had been sympathetic to Palestinian frustrations and had encouraged Israel to revive the momentum of peace talks with the PLO. The tortuous negotiations between Israel and the PLO have been in marked contrast to the smooth and speedy Israeli-Jordanian peace talks. Jordan and Israel continued making swift progress in talks yesterday. Israeli radio said the two sides agreed to joint promotion of regional tourism and would produce a joint tourist brochure within 10 days. They also agreed to begin connecting their electricity grids next week. After the summit Mr Rabin said he had expressed concern about Palestinian violence against Israelis and stressed Israel's abiding focus on security. Mr Rabin strongly criticised remarks by Mr Farouk Kadoumi, PLO Foreign minister, who called on Monday for the destruction of Israel. 'I hope that on the Israeli side and the Palestinian side tension and violence will be reduced, and statements that undermine or are against what we are committed to will not be heard,' he said.

Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO chairman, flew to Egypt for talks on setting up a Palestinian police force, an Israeli team made plans to visit Tunis for talks on refugees, and the US confirmed that it would release Dollars 30m in security assistance to Jordan which it had blocked since the Gulf war. The establishment of Palestinian police units to take responsibility for security in the Gaza Strip and in Jericho after the first stage of Israeli troop redeployment is one of the main priorities for the PLO. Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, stressed on Tuesday that he would judge the PLO commitment to peace on its ability to end violence in the occupied territories. The PLO is expected to hold talks with Hamas, its main rival in the territories which has opposed the peace process, in Yemen later this month. There has been no indication yet from Hamas leaders they are prepared to halt attacks on Israeli forces in the West Bank and Gaza, even after the troops have withdrawn from the main areas of population. Mr Arafat said after talks in Alexandria yesterday with President Hosni Mubarak that he was grateful for Egyptian assistance in training a police force and other professionals. He also described Egypt as the principal architect of the plan to introduce limited Palestinian autonomy first to Gaza and Jericho, asserting that Mr Mubarak had first put the idea to Mr Rabin when the two men met in April. 'It would be unjust to say that Egypt played a role. Egypt was more than a participant in what we achieved. It was a complete and full partner,' said Mr Arafat. His statement followed criticism in Cairo newspapers that Mr Arafat had not mentioned Egypt's role during his speech at the White House on Monday. Mr Amr Musa, the Egyptian foreign minister, said the talks had also focused on convening committees to flesh out the peace pact and arrangements to be taken before the actual transfer of authority from Israelis to Palestinians. 'We discussed certain steps such as negotiations on the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Jericho and Gaza, the committees that will prepare for elections there, and the arrangements and co-ordination with Egypt and Jordan concerning the return of displaced people and matters pertaining to the established administration,' he added. In Amman yesterday officials expressed their satisfaction at the US decision to release the Dollars 30m in blocked aid. The released funds comprise Dollars 15m in economic support, Dollars 9m in military aid, Dollars 500,000 for military training and the remaining Dollars 5.5m for general projects. The decision also reflected US satisfaction at Jordan's improved participation in the imposition of sanctions against the Iraqi regime of President Saddam Hussein. US officials said yesterday they were examining other ways of pushing forward the process, including convening a meeting of potential donors to back the Israel-PLO accord. The State Department on Wednesday hosted a day-long meeting with senior officials from the White House, National Security Council and US Agency for International Development to discuss a possible aid summit. President Bill Clinton also made a 40-minute telephone call to President Hafez al-Assad of Syria to assure him of US support for an eventual Israel-Syria deal. He also urged Mr Assad to rein in 'rejectionist' Palestinian opposition to the PLO-Israeli accord. At least 10 rejectionist groups are based in Damascus. Israel confirmed yesterday that it was sending officials to Tunis for talks on Palestinian refugees. The visit is intended primarily to prepare for next month's multilateral round of talks on refugee issues which were scheduled to run in parallel with main bilateral peace talks in Washington. Jordan also yesterday began asking Palestinians living in the country illegally to register with the police. The measure appeared to apply to residents of the West Bank and Gaza who came to Jordan on temporary visits. Most of them have Jordanian passports but are limited to one-month stays in the kingdom. 'This is only a routine measure to allow them to rectify (the status of) their stay,' said a Jordanian official. 'We will not take any action against anyone.'

The 23, all veterans of the Afghanistan war, were believed  to  have plotted to kill Jordanian Prime Minister 'Abd-al-Salam  al-Majali and Palestinian peace negotiators Faysal al-Husayni  and Hanan 'Ashrawi last year, according to charges being drawn  up against them.    The militants, already detained for more than one month,  were  also suspected of involvement in a series of bomb blasts in  Jordan in January and February.    The official said the militants plotted to kill al-Majali  during an interview, with one of the group posing as a  journalist. However, the interview was postponed.    Al-Majali was leading Jordan's delegation to the bilateral  peace talks with Israel at the time. The Arab-Israeli talks  were suspended after the February 25 Hebron massacre.    The militants also planned to kill al-Husayni and 'Ashrawi  when the Palestinian leaders made one of their regular trips to  Amman, the official said.    Bombs were to be planted in their hotel rooms with the  connivance of a hotel employee, but the plot failed due to the  secrecy surrounding the Palestinian leaders' movements.    The official said the militants were expected to stand trial  at the end of April.    The group's aim was to ""torpedo the peace process and get  alcoholic drinks, bars and cinemas outlawed,"" the official  explained.    On February 6 the authorities said they had arrested two  Islamic militants implicated in the bombings of two cinemas in  Jordan on January 26 and February 1 which injured a total of  nine people. The two had reportedly fought in Afghanistan.    Interior Minister Salamah Hammad said a group of militants  had been rounded up for planning attacks against the Jordanian  parliament and leading political figures.    Nearly 400 Jordanians and Palestinians have returned to  Jordan over the past year after undergoing military training  with the Afghan Mujahedin.     "

Success or failure of the  ongoing bilateral talks in Washington will depend on whether  Israel will go along with a comprehensive and just settlement.    The ball is now in the Israeli court and the world is  looking  to see how far Israeli officials are able to comprehend  international developments after the Geneva summit. By  reverting to shiftiness and the tactic of separate deals, Israel  is thus passing up a valuable chance to achieve a settlement  which it needs even more than the Arabs. A world so impressed  by the outcome of the summit of the age and the personality of  President Hafiz al-Asad continues to hope that the summit will  still be able to push the peace process forward and then achieve  the peace of the brave. The world will not tolerate another  Israeli attempt to bypass the summit. Meanwhile, the U.S.  Administration, which is firmly convinced Syria is seeking true  peace, wants Israel to comprehend the new facts of the new stage  and to help Washington make a go of the American initiative of  the land-for-peace formula. Syria's idea of the land-for-peace  formula is for Israel to effect an unconditional withdrawal from  the occupied Golan Heights and southern Lebnaon, which is being  demanded of the Israeli negotiators in Washington. The Israeli  negotiators are not coming up with any better ideas than the  ones they put forward in previous sessions. Their arrival in  Washington was preceded by the bizarre and unwarranted call for  a referendum to decide whether to withdraw from the Golan -- a  call that runs counter to an international and American support  for the right of the region's peoples to a just, comprehensive,  and durable peace, the peace of the brave.    In another commentary, AL-THAWRAH writes under the headline  ""The New Opportunity:"" The current round of the Washington  talks is an opportunity to relaunch and break the deadlock in  the peace process. Whatever the expectations held out for the  Washington talks, it is important that they prove more  productive than earlier rounds. In which case the optimism that  the talks will yield results will have been justified. For this  to happen, the Israeli negotiators need to adopt new postures  and speak a new language, and stay away from equivocation and  trickery. The paper notes that the Geneva summit gave the peace  process a chance to succeed. But there is the risk of this  chance being lost unless Israel shows seriousness and commits  itself publicly and unequivocally to the parameters of a just  peace as outlined by the Madrid formula and reiterated at the  Geneva summit. Just how serious Israel is will be judged by  whether it will state a clear intention to pull out from all the  occupied territory and admit that a comprehensive settlement on  all fronts without detriment to Arab rights is the only road to  peace.

Mr Rabin's surprise trip came as the government prepared to muster its forces to face right-wing demonstrations and a two-day parliamentary debate over the Israeli-Palestinian peace accord. Over the weekend Mr Rabin and Mr Shimon Peres, the foreign minister, appeared to rule out the possibility of a referendum on the peace deal. Israeli officials said the Alexandria talks would focus on how Egypt could cement the peace agreement, the possibility of Cairo as a venue for further Israeli-Palestinian negotiations and how to make progress in peace talks with Syria and Lebanon. Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, was also in Egypt yesterday where he addressed Arab League foreign ministers but Israeli officials said a Rabin-Arafat meeting was unlikely. PLO officials, preparing for meetings with Israel, Arab states and the World Bank said they were asking the bank to more than double a Dollars 3bn development plan to rehabilitate the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Separately, The Japanese government is considering contributing Dollars 100m a year to Palestinian communities according to weekend press reports. In the occupied territories the Islamic fundamentalist Hamas movement said it had not reached an accord with the PLO, as announced by PLO headquarters in Tunis. Hamas also said it would not participate in elections to a self-rule council and would urge Palestinians to boycott the vote. Also yesterday, the Jordanian government indicated it may postpone multi-party elections to avoid debate on the Palestinian self-rule agreement from overshadowing other issues. The elections, due on 8 November, were to be the first since 1956 in which political parties would campaign. King Hussein and government officials say they fear the elections may become a referendum on the peace process. They also expressed concern that Palestinians who intend to return to the West Bank and Gaza under the PLO-Israeli agreement will distort the result. Jordan's nationalist parties and tribal leaders have been vocal in their calls for postponing the elections. Head of the nationalist party Al Ahd, Mr Hadi Abdul Majali, argues that either Palestinians who will be allowed to return should have their voting rights relinquished or the elections should be postponed.

0,FT942-7418 ,"FT942-7418 _AN-EEYDRAGRFT 940525   FT  25 MAY 94 / Survey of Ireland (1): Goal is to be on the fast track to EMU - As recession lifts, Ireland is in a good position to take advantage of the upswing      By TIM COONE   When the Channel Tunnel linking Britain and France was officially inaugurated earlier this month, most Irish newspapers were quick to note that Ireland was now the only EU nation without a land-link to the rest of the member states. They lamented the fact that the tunnel would reinforce Ireland's isolation and warned that Irish goods would find it more difficult to compete with British ones in Europe's populous heartland. What good are Irish Oscars, Booker Prizes and successes in the Eurovision song contest if they do not produce jobs, they asked? Although Ireland has had some outstanding successes in stealing the European limelight in music, literature and film over the past year, the frustration of not being closer to the economic and political pulse of Europe is strongly felt. As the European parliamentary elections approach, there are no powerful Euro-sceptic lobbies or irate backbenchers berating the government for wanting to be in the fast track to European monetary union (EMU). That goal is a cross-party objective. But Irish fears of economic isolation are perhaps overstated. As the clouds of recession show signs of breaking up, the country appears to be better positioned than many of its EU partners to take advantage of the upswing. The Fianna Fail-Labour coalition, now in its second year, has maintained the central thrust of the economic policy pursued by two previous governments since 1987 - reduction in the debt/GNP ratio and securing price stability. A measure of that policy's success is that inflation in 1993 fell to 1.5 per cent, one of the lowest in the EU. The crisis in the European exchange rate mechanism towards the end of 1992, putting pressure on several European currencies including the British pound, forced the incoming coalition government to accept a 10 per cent devaluation of the punt within weeks of taking office. Despite the turbulence at the time, this has had a salutary effect. Interest rates are now at record lows and heading lower; foreign currency reserves are higher than before the crisis; exports look likely to hit record new levels and consumer demand is showing strong signs of recovery. The fiscal deficit is well under control - Mr Bertie Ahern, the finance minister, felt confident enough to give away IPounds 333m in tax reliefs to the lower-paid in last January's budget, equivalent to 1.1 per cent of GNP. Indeed, the budget's underlying assumption of a 3.8 per cent growth rate in GNP this year is now looking conservative. The latest spate of economic forecasts from independent analysts put the figure closer to 5 per cent, a level which is expected to be sustained up to the end of the century. On that basis, the current budget deficit will be eliminated by 1996, and the EMU target of reducing the debt/GDP ratio to 60 per cent appears attainable by the end of the decade. Provided that inflation is not stoked up again, Ireland has thus positioned itself well to take the fast track to Europe. Yet there remains a fundamental problem at the heart of economic policy-making, as Mr Han de Jong, chief economist at Goodbody, Dublin stockbrokers, points out: 'In conducting exchange rate policy, the authorities are using a basket of currencies with sterling and the DM as heavyweights. The foreign exchange market, on the other hand, has effectively relinked the punt to sterling . . . the perceived poor quality of economic policy-making in the UK is the core of the problem for the Irish authorities and constitutes the paradox of Irish policy intentions,' he said. While the Irish authorities want Ireland to be among the first to participate in monetary union, they are being held hostage to the political fortunes of a UK Conservative party in disarray over Europe. According to Mr de Jong: 'UK politics is a constant potential threat to (economic) stability.' In other economic policy-making areas - notably the deregulation of state enterprises - Irish freedom of action is subject to internal rather than external constraints, but still the process has had successes. Aer Lingus, the state-run airline, has managed to emerge from a big restructuring, aimed at returning it to profitability, without a crippling labour dispute. Unions at An Post, the state postal service, have accepted radical changes to work practices. Both companies are searching for overseas partners. The rail unions are proving more reluctant to accept change at Iarnrod Eireann (Irish Rail), the heaviest government loss-maker, but as practically all of Europe's railways are heavily subsidised, most of the attention will now focus on Telecom Eireann, the state telecommunications company, and on whether a proposed link-up with British telecommunications group, Cable  Wireless, will get the go-ahead from the government. Telecom unions have indicated that they will support a joint venture with a foreign partner - but are opposed to one with Cable  Wireless. The importance of telecommunications to the economy cannot be over-estimated. Over the past 10 years Ireland's telecommunications services have improved dramatically. The recent entry of competitors into the international segment of the market is rapidly bringing down the cost of calls, adding to the continuing tax attractions of setting up business in Ireland, not least in the financial service industries. More than 150 offshore funds totalling some Dollars 9bn are now managed out of the International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) in Dublin, a sector which has grown rapidly in the past two years. A growing number of funds is also being listed on the Dublin stock exchange, which itself is attracting an increasing amount of overseas attention. Inward industrial investment is also continuing to notch up successes. Several new projects - in the health care sector, in telemarketing and in electronics, among others - have been announced since the beginning of the year. (Generous grants and a low tax regime have helped to attract these, despite intense competition from, for example, Scotland and Wales.) Ireland's profile - and its hopes of attracting further investment in both manufacturing and services - will be raised further next month when its team travels to the US to play in the finals of football's world cup in Orlando and New York, accompanied by tens of thousands of supporters. A flood of Italian tourists to Ireland followed Ireland's participation in the 1990 World Cup in Italy. A similar effect is hoped for in the US, traditionally Ireland's main overseas tourist market. An increase in numbers from the US will be especially welcome in the west of Ireland, which is having to come to terms with the reform of the EU's common agricultural policy. This is forcing change in the traditional dairy and beef farming sectors in favour of new industries such as tourism and forestry. Planting of new woodlands and forests has accelerated in the past five years, encouraged by generous grants and incentives which are scheduled to be increased again soon. A forest products industry is already undergoing expansion. This is expected to be as important to the economy, in 20 years, as the food industry is now. So Ireland's position at the edge of Europe is not the disadvantage it is frequently made out to be. Its comparative advantages have been recognised and economic and political stability is fostering a positive climate for inward investment by companies positioning themselves for growth in the European market. Much more would be possible, too, given a satisfactory resolution of the island of Ireland's most intractable problem - Northern Ireland, an issue which has absorbed large amounts of ministerial time over the past year. While prospects for peace in the province have come tantalisingly closer than at any time in the past 25 years, as a result of talks with the UK government leading up to the Downing Street Declaration, the government has had to accept that its suggestion last year that 'peace by Christmas' was possible was wide of the mark. It may be some way down the road yet. Nevertheless, even on this issue, there are signs of the same movement, which, in other areas, is leading to hopes of a more prosperous and stable future for Ireland in the twenty-first century.

In their open and cordial talks with Slobodan Milosevic the  representatives of the Russian parliament expressed support for  Serbia's peace efforts and voiced their unanimous stand that  economic sanctions against the FRY should be lifted  unconditionally, according to a statement released by the office  of the Serbian president. These sanctions are essentially an  expression of discriminatory policies, something that is at odds  with the principle of equality in international relations. The  economic blockade of the FRY imposed by the international  community is in deep contravention of modern and democratic  commitments to integration in the worldm, since it is one of the  most inhumane actions taken against a people at the end of the  20th century, it was said at today's meeting between President  Milosevic and the Russian parliamentarians.    In the opinion of the members of the Russian parliament,  Russia should help, with its principled and objective attitudes  to the parties in the Yugoslav crisis, to find a just political  solution, something that is totally incompatible with the  continuation of the unreasonable economic blockade against the  FRY. Stressing that Serbia holds in high regard Russia's  balanced and impartial attitudes, as well as its peace efforts  aimed at bringing an end to the civil war in  ex-Bosnia-Herzegovina as soon as possible and establish a just  and stable peace in these lands, President Milosevic pointed out  that in this context it is of great importance to restore the  impartial role of the United Nations in the peace process in  ex-Bosnia-Herzegovina and to abandon the policy of pressures,  threats, and imposed solutions on the part of the international  community. During the talks it was stressed that Serbia  advocates an end to all hostilities and a political solution  secured through a negotiating process.    FRY Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic also took part in  today's talks between President Milosevic and the Russian  parliamentarians.     "

The guarantees obtained here in Washington should help all this  to be implemented effectively and as soon as possible.    Two of the six agreements signed are, so to speak, of a  general nature. One of those two agreements obligates the  signatories to support the formation of the federation between  Croats and Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and the other to  support the development of economic and military cooperation  between the Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation and the Republic of  Croatia. There are also four separate documents: the  preliminary agreement on the confederal relations between the  Republic of Croatia and the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina,  the agreement granting the Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation access  to the sea via the territory of the Republic of Croatia, the  agreement granting the Republic of Croatia free passage through  the territory of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation, and finally,  the agreement on the constitution of Bosnia- Herzegovina, which  will be sent to the Constitutional Assembly for discussion and  adoption.    After the signing ceremony, President Clinton had separate  talks first with President Izetbegovic, and then with President  Tudjman.    The Republic of Croatia and the whole of the Croatian nation  highly appreciate the role of the United States and President  Clinton in reaching the agreement on creating the Croat-Bosniak  Federation and the confederation between the future  Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation and the Republic of Croatia.    This is said in a statement by President Tudjman following  his talks with President Clinton.    These agreements will be important for halting the war in  the  former Yugoslavia and the creation of conditions for permanent  peace and stability of the new world order in this part of  Europe. The United States' leading role -- moral, political, and  in the security sphere -- is of paramount interest for uniting  efforts for preserving peace on the part of the most important  world factors -- the United Nations, the CSCE, the European  Union, NATO, and individual states. The role of the pope and  the Vatican are of paramount importance in the ecumenical  efforts to restore peace and encourage cooperation between the  nations and religious communities in different crisis areas.  This is also said in a statement issued after President  Tudjman's talks with President Clinton.    President Tudjman also held talks with European Union  Foreign  Ministers Van der Broek, Claes, Kinkel, and Papoulias. A  luncheon offered in honor of Presidents Tudjman and Izetbegovic,  and the Croatian and Muslim delegation by U.S. Secretary of  State Warren Christopher is under way.     "

Former Israeli Prime  Minister Yitzhaq Shamir said he wanted peace, but peace in  return for peace. This means peace, plus the Arab territories  Israel occupies.    For his part, current Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin  has announced that he wants peace, but he wants peace without  any commitment to comprehensive withdrawal from the Golan. This  means he wants Syria to give him peace, without committing  himself to abandoning occupied Syrian territory.    Strangely, Rabin accuses Syria of not being ready for peace,  as if peace is something detached from the Israeli occupation  and the UN resolutions, especially Resolution 242, which says  acquisition of land by force is illegal.    The U.S. initiative that launched the peace process in  Madrid, and then in the Washington talks, considered  implementation of Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338 the  basis for reaching a just and comprehensive peace in the region  in accordance with the principle of exchanging land for peace.  This exchange does not mean part of the land. It means all of  the occupied land. This cannot be subject to bargaining under  any security, political, or interest pretexts.    If Israel really wants peace and does not want to obstruct  the implementation of the U.S. initiative, it would have  approved the principle of comprehensive withdrawal from the  Golan in return for full peace. But Israel does not want peace  unless it is subject to its expansionist logic. This is what  Rabin recently stated openly when he said he is not prepared to  pledge full withdrawal from the Golan to Syria. Who, then, is  responsible for stalemating the peace talks and for the lack of  progress in the peace process? Is it not Israel, whose leaders  sometimes speak about conditional peace, and at other times  about withdrawal from the Golan or about secret talks to abort  the Madrid and Washington talks?    Mixing the cards with Syria will not take place as Rabin  hopes because Syria stands with a peace in which it will never  relinquish a grain of its national soil. This fact was  emphasized by President Hafiz al-Asad during the summit he held  in Geneva with President Clinton, who in turn stressed the U.S.  commitment to realize a just and comprehensive peace.    After the U.S. emphasis of its commitment to the peace  process, and in light of the Israeli positions that obstruct the  implementation of the U.S. initiative, the Israeli leaders stick  to the logic of occupier, thus rendering U.S. credibility  hollow, especially because Rabin knows, more than anyone else,  that the answer he gave to U.S. Secretary of State Christopher  during his latest visit to Israel was the main reason for the  stalemating of the peace talks.

0,FT931-11158 ,"FT931-11158 _AN-DBDCDAD5FT 930204   FT  04 FEB 93 / Israeli PM defiant over right to deport: Peace talks still in doubt      By HUGH CARNEGY and REUTER      JERUSALEM, WASHINGTON   MR Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, insisted yesterday that Israel retained the right to carry out future mass expulsions of Palestinians and implied that the US had condoned the deportation in December of 400 alleged Islamic militants to Lebanon. His remarks, during a defiant speech to an angry parliament, seemed certain to deepen Palestinian rejection of an earlier compromise offer by Israel on the expulsions and further complicate prospects of resuming Middle East peace talks which the US wants to reconvene within weeks. His offer to bring home around 100 of the 400 Palestinian deportees stranded in Lebanon has already been rejected by Palestinians who insist they will not return to the negotiating table until every deportee is brought back. Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, is to visit the region later this month to try to achieve an early resumption of the peace talks, Mr Amr Moussa, Egypt's foreign minister, said in Cairo yesterday. Responding to criticism of his compromise on the expulsions from right-wing opposition MPs, Mr Rabin said: 'The principle remains of our ability to remove for a limited time hundreds of inciters, leaders, organisers. You never succeeded in doing that.' Washington's acceptance of the compromise offer 'created a groundwork of understanding for a subject that America in principle opposed and opposes. But it accepted this reality - and in unprecedented dimensions,' he said. The Clinton administration says Monday's offer by Israel to repatriate a quarter of the deportees immediately and shorten to no more than one year the exile of the remainder removed the need for any further action by the United Nations Security Council to enforce resolution 799 calling for the immediate return of them all. But Mr Rabin's remarks are certain to stiffen the Palestine Liberation Organisation's insistence that only full compliance with resolution 799 will suffice to restart peace talks. One of the key concerns of both the PLO and Hamas, the Islamic fundamentalist organisation to which most deportees allegedly belong, is to ensure that the expulsions do not create a precedent for future mass deportations, perhaps the most sensitive political issue in the occupied territories. Palestinian leaders in Jerusalem yesterday summoned western diplomats to warn that they would not accept any early call to resume peace negotiations. 'We told them that if they issue invitations to the talks, they know our participation is suspended. We cannot continue the peace process before all the Palestinians return,' said Mr Saeb Erekat, a senior delegate to the talks. Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, acknowledged that continuing the talks with Syria, Lebanon and Jordan without the Palestinians was unrealistic. Reuter adds from Washington: Diplomats said yesterday the US had been forced to call off Middle East peace talks on regional issues scheduled for next week because of the dispute over Palestinians deported by Israel. Two sessions were due to convene on February 9, one in Rome on regional economic issues and the second in Washington on arms control. A session on refugees was scheduled the following week in Oslo.

The government  did so as a gesture to encourage national reconciliation. UNITA  has not accepted that gesture by the government. UNITA demands,  needs, or requires more ministerial portfolios. It has demanded  far more than what it deserves. Our government has already  noted that it will not make any more such concessions. So, this  was an offer the government made UNITA and now the government is  unwilling to negotiate that offer.

0,FT944-13340 ,"FT944-13340 _AN-EJ1D8AACFT 941028   FT  28 OCT 94 / Syrian talks make progress, says Clinton: Israelis disappointed at meeting with Assad      By JULIAN OZANNE      JERUSALEM   US president Bill Clinton said yesterday he had made significant progress in talks with President Hafez al-Assad of Syria aimed at edging Israeli-Syrian peace negotiations forward. But the Israeli foreign ministry described the Clinton-Assad meeting as a 'great disappointment' and said Mr Clinton had boosted Mr Assad's prestige in the Middle East by his visit but had come away empty-handed. After four hours of talks with the Syrian president in Damascus, Mr Clinton said he had made progress but was not free to discuss the details. He said Mr Assad's remarks yesterday, in which he pledged to 'hasten the march of peace', went beyond anything he had said before. 'Syria has made a strategic choice for peace with Israel. Syria is ready to commit itself to the requirements of peace for the long term, to transform the region from a state of war to a state of peace, and to allow Arab and Israeli to live in security, prosperity and stability,' Mr Clinton said in a speech to the Israeli parliament last night. 'I believe something is changing in Syria. Its leaders understand that it is time to make peace. There will be still a good deal of hard bargaining before a breakthrough but they are serious about proceeding . . . We will walk with you on the road to Damascus for peace with security.' Israeli officials, however, said Mr Assad had merely restated Syria's hardline position demanding a full Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Golan Heights and had embarrassed the US president by saying that no US official had ever proved Syrian involvement in an act of international terror. 'For us the visit would have been a success if Clinton had been able to broker direct talks between our foreign minister and the Syrian foreign minister,' said a senior Israeli foreign ministry official. 'The least we expected was something firm about terrorism.' Mr Clinton said later he regretted that Mr Assad had not taken the opportunity to publicly condemn acts of terror against Israelis. Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, said that although Mr Clinton had brought no breakthrough, Israel would not be discouraged and would continue to be patient and determined and pursue any avenue which remained open to reach peace with Syria and Lebanon. Diplomats said Mr Assad was happy that Mr Clinton had renewed US commitment to an Israeli withdrawal from all land occupied in the West Bank, Arab East Jerusalem, the Golan Heights and southern Lebanon. But Mr Rabin warned: 'Jerusalem is not open for negotiations. It is not a matter for bargaining . . . Jerusalem was and will be the eternal capital of the state of Israel, under Israeli sovereignty - the beating heart of the Jewish people.' Mr Clinton had to cancel his scheduled walkabout around Jerusalem in the face of Palestinian opposition.

The committee and the parties to the conflict agreed that  pursuant to the mandate given by the meeting off the IGADD  summit held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia on 6 and 7 September 1993,  the negotiations shall take into consideration the previous  efforts in search of a solution to the conflict, namely talks  held in August 1989, Addis Ababa, December 1989 in Nairobi, May  to June 1992 and April to May 1993 in Abuja and May 1993 in  Nairobi.    The committee expressed serious concern at the continued  human suffering, misery, famine and disease in the war-affected  areas. It was agreed that the parties to the conflict shall  allow access to relief agencies to ensure that the relief  assistance is delivered to the suffering people in those areas.    The committee also expressed deep concern that the long  drawn-out conflict was a threat to peace and security in the  sub-region. In reference to their stated commitment to the  IGADD peace initiative including their readiness to immediately  embark on negotiations, the parties to the conflict agreed to  send to the peace talks high-level delegations with a full  mandate to negotiate. The committee called upon the parties  concerned to the conflict to exercise restraint and desist from  escalating hostilities, including actions that might jeopardise  the IGADD initiative, in order to create a conducive atmosphere  for the conduct of negotiations.    The IGADD committee decided that the standing committee of  ministers of foreign affairs shall conduct the peace  negotiations under the supervision of the chairman of the IGADD  committee and directed the standing committee to start the  negotiating process immediately.    The IGADD committee further appealed to the international  community to continue supporting the initiative. [passage  omitted]     "

0,FT944-8281 ,"FT944-8281 _AN-EKUDAACVFT 941121   FT  21 NOV 94 / Leading Article: No bad thing for Ireland   The outside world in general, and Britain and Northern Ireland in particular, have been watching with some confusion and alarm as the Irish government pulled itself apart over the past week. Just as the peace process in Ireland offers a real chance of relief for the bombed and battered population of the north, the coalition in Dublin appears to have collapsed over what outsiders might regard as a domestic squabble. It would be wrong, however, to dismiss the issues involved in the disintegration of the Irish government, and the resignation of Mr Albert Reynolds as prime minister and leader of Fianna Fail, the largest party, as irrelevant to the peace process and the future of Ireland. Far from it. The confrontation between Mr Dick Spring and his Labour party, on the one hand, and Mr Reynolds' party on the other, has exposed some vital questions about the democratic process in the Irish republic. The first is whether the country can claim to be a genuinely secular state while the Roman Catholic church continues to wield a pervasive influence in political life, a subject of enormous concern to the northern Irish protestant population. The second is the tradition of making blatantly political appointments to the Irish judiciary. The third is the question of accountability of politicians for their words and actions, an important component in an open and flourishing democracy. On all of these concerns, the Irish republic would appear to have emerged strengthened as a democratic state from the events of the past week. The confrontation in the coalition blew up over the insistence of Mr Reynolds on nominating his friend and attorney-general, Mr Harry Whelehan, as the next president of the High Court, the second highest judicial office in the land. Mr Whelehan was already a highly controversial figure for his role in seeking to prevent a 14-year-old rape victim from travelling to Britain for an abortion. His obvious reluctance to extradite a self-confessed paedophile priest to face charges in Northern Ireland compounded the impression that he was unduly influenced by the most conservative elements in the Catholic church. The fact that both have now been forced to resign - and that their resignation has been welcomed by the Irish population - suggests that the trend towards a more secular state is growing, as is the pressure for clean government. Both misled their cabinet colleagues and parliament, and both have been held accountable. Mr Spring now faces a tough decision whether to reform the coalition with Fianna Fail under its new leader, Mr Bertie Ahern. On balance, he would appear wise to do so, at least to bring minimum disruption to the peace process. Mr Ahern has a good record as a successful negotiator and broker of tough compromises as a trade union leader, and labour minister. Mr Spring has proved some important points. Now the most crucial thing is to keep the peace process on track.   Countries:-  IEZ  Ireland, EC.   Industries:-  P9199 General Government, NEC.     P8651 Political Organizations.

The Palestinians' Central Council or 'mini-parliament' is also likely to lay down guidelines for Palestine Liberation Organisation participation in any proposed peace process. PLO officials have expressed strong reservations about the latest US Middle East peace mission. They fear the US will seek to exclude the PLO from the process. But the organisation, sidelined regionally and internationally since its support of Iraq in the Gulf war, is anxious to use any opportunity to re-establish working relations with Egypt and the Gulf states. Mr Abdullah Hourani, a member of the PLO's Executive Committee or 'cabinet', said yesterday that 'co-ordination between Arab positions is important. . . in particular, total agreement between the PLO and Jordan on all stages in the peace process.' The Central Council is likely to review the PLO's performance during the recent crisis and to discuss ways to revive its flagging fortunes. Among options to be discussed are convening a session of the Palestine Nations Council, the Palestinian 'parliament', to express confidence in the PLO leadership. There has also been talk of seeking UN backing for elections in the occupied territories for delegates to the PNC.  The Financial Times   London Page 3  "

The signs of progress came on the eve of the resumption of suspended peace talks between Israel and its Arab neighbours, due to begin in Washington today. Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, said Israel was 'pretty close' to reaching agreement with the PLO after he met Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman, in Oslo on Saturday. Mr Peres said Mr Ahmed Qurie (Abu Ala'a) of the PLO and Mr Yoel Singer, an Israeli legal adviser, would meet in Paris during the week to summarise points of agreement and exchange documents. Mr Peres said there was a more than 50 per cent chance a final agreement could be reached when he meets Mr Arafat again at the Davos Economic Forum in Switzerland next Sunday. In Cairo Mr Arafat said: 'There are some points we haven't agreed on but there are some obstacles we managed to overcome.' Neither Mr Peres nor Mr Arafat confirmed the details of the progress reached in Oslo. Mr Arafat yesterday briefed President Hosni Mubarak on the Oslo talks. Officials said Mr Amr Moussa, Egyptian foreign minister, would visit Jerusalem today to help consolidate any achievements. Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, endorsed the view that progress had been made in Oslo. 'I believe an Israeli clarification and its position in principal matters of security has begun to bear results.' Mr Rabin also said he was ready to meet President Assad without any prior conditions in order to advance the peace process. Following the meetings in Cairo, Mr Arafat was scheduled to fly to Saudi Arabia for the first time since the kingdom severed ties with the PLO for siding with Iraq in the Gulf war.

During a visit to the province later today Mr Major is expected to publicly acknowledge for the first time that the government is now operating on the 'working assumption' that the end to violence is permanent. He is likely also to spell out the terms and timetable for talks with Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, to bring the republican movement into the negotiations for a new constitutional settlement. Speaking ahead of a planned summit meeting on Monday with Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, Mr Major will signal the end of the exclusion orders banning Mr Gerry Adams and other prominent Sinn Fein members from visiting the British mainland. Senior Unionist politicians predicted that Mr Major would also signpost the essential elements of the govern-ment's tests for the IRA to demonstrate its good faith. In the meantime, he is likely to seek to underline his own determination to secure peace by announcing a phased withdrawal to barracks of British troops in the province. The prime minister's visit comes after a meeting of senior ministers yesterday which gave him a free hand to press on towards talks with republican leaders by Christmas. Downing Street said the government was moving towards adopting a 'working assumption' that the IRA ceasefire was permanent. The summit between Mr Reynolds and Mr Major will be their first face-to-face meeting since the IRA and loyalist ceasefires. The two will discuss the joint framework document with which they hope to inject momentum into political talks involving Ulster's main constitutional parties. In Dublin yesterday, Mr Reynolds met Mr Adams to discuss progress on the peace process and plans for a cross-party national forum for peace and reconciliation. Mr Adams said: 'The momentum for real peace is still there, and is building.' But he criticised the 'hesitant, faltering and begrudging' UK response to the IRA ceasefire.

The 23, all veterans of the Afghanistan war, were believed  to  have plotted to kill Jordanian Prime Minister 'Abd-al-Salam  al-Majali and Palestinian peace negotiators Faysal al-Husayni  and Hanan 'Ashrawi last year, according to charges being drawn  up against them.    The militants, already detained for more than one month,  were  also suspected of involvement in a series of bomb blasts in  Jordan in January and February.    The official said the militants plotted to kill al-Majali  during an interview, with one of the group posing as a  journalist. However, the interview was postponed.    Al-Majali was leading Jordan's delegation to the bilateral  peace talks with Israel at the time. The Arab-Israeli talks  were suspended after the February 25 Hebron massacre.    The militants also planned to kill al-Husayni and 'Ashrawi  when the Palestinian leaders made one of their regular trips to  Amman, the official said.    Bombs were to be planted in their hotel rooms with the  connivance of a hotel employee, but the plot failed due to the  secrecy surrounding the Palestinian leaders' movements.    The official said the militants were expected to stand trial  at the end of April.    The group's aim was to ``torpedo the peace process and get  alcoholic drinks, bars and cinemas outlawed,'' the official  explained.    On 6 February the authorities said they had arrested two  Islamic militants implicated in the bombings of two cinemas in  Jordan on 26 January and 1 February which injured a total of  nine people. The two had reportedly fought in Afghanistan.    Interior Minister Salamah Hammad said a group of militants  had been rounded up for planning attacks against the Jordanian  parliament and leading political figures.    Nearly 400 Jordanians and Palestinians have returned to  Jordan over the past year after undergoing military training  with the Afghan Mujahedin.     "

The concession to the PLO came after Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman, said a package of guarantees allowing the Palestinians to return to the peace negotiations may be reached at today's meeting in Vladivostok between Mr Andrei Kozyrev, Russian foreign minister, and Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state. The two countries are co-sponsors of the Middle East peace process. PLO officials said yesterday under the agreement Russia and the US would back a United Nations Security Council resolution condemning last month's Hebron mosque massacre and providing for the deployment of an international force in the territories to help protect Palestinian lives. Israel would promise to speed up the peace talks on implementing Palestinian self-rule and would complete a military withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and West Bank area of Jericho by April 13. In return the PLO would resume talks in Washington and Paris next Monday. The outlawing of Kehane Lives and Kach, two militant orthodox Jewish groups which glorify violence against Palestinians in the Israeli occupied territories, has been one of the PLO demands for returning to talks. Both groups, which have only a handful of activists, are followers of Rabbi Meir Kehane, a slain Jewish racist who believed violence against Arabs sanctify Jews, reveal God's glory and bring the coming of the Messiah closer. Kach has been banned from parliamentary politics since 1988 because of its racist electoral platform which demanded prison terms for Arabs and Jews who had sexual relations. Mr Baruch Goldstein, the Jewish settler who massacred 30 Palestinians in a Hebron Mosque last month, was a member of Kach. Mr Michael Ben-Yair, attorney general, compared the two organisations with the Islamic extremist Hamas movement which rejects peace talks and advocates violence against Jews. Mr Ben-Yair said the two groups wanted to create a Jewish theocracy in the biblical land of Israel and force the 2m Palestinians living in the territories to leave. The cabinet unanimously endorsed the ban after reports from the police and internal security that members of the two organisations were involved in murders of Arabs.

Analysts  say the talks may face some difficulties, because rumors are  going around that UNITA intends to derail the negotiation  process. Joao Ligio, our correspondent in the Zambian capital,  is on the telephone to give us more details:    [Begin Ligio recording] It is three days now since  Mulungushi  Conference Hall has seen any activity in connection with the  Angolan peace process. UN Special Representative Alioune  Blondin Beye closed the hall's doors and left for Luanda on yet  another charity mission. However, his absence has not meant  that the government and UNITA teams have been idle. Instead,  they have been working at finding consensus concerning the  operation of the future National Police. To keep the talks  going, before leaving, the UN special representative handed over  to the negotiators the theoretical formulas that are contained  in a document regarded as the final draft in a bid to reduce the  gap between the two sides.    Without meetings and without Blondin Beye constantly  summoning them, the two sides now have more time to learn about  the general situation (?in Angola), where the specter of war  continues to loom large. Within this context, reports have been  reaching Lusaka about certain developments on the battlefield.  The effect of those reports has been to undermine the optimism  that had marked these talks at one stage.    It is known that the UNITA leader has called an emergency  meeting of the UNITA Political Commission. That meeting began  on 21 January and it is not being attended by any of the  officials in the team to the Lusaka peace talks. (?He) has also  issued a communique in which Cubans and Russians are accused of  holding talks with the Angolan Government concerning a return of  Cuban military forces to Angola. That communique adds that UNITA  will not make any concessions in connection with the Riot Police  issue. Such developments are in clear contrast with what a  reliable source in the Black Cockerel movement has said: He  asked journalists here in Lusaka not to mix the country's  internal developments with developments at the talks. According  to that source, the main obstacles concerning the specific  principles that will govern the future National Police have been  overcome and the next 24 working hours could see an end to the  existing deadlock over the percentages of men from both sides  that will join the Riot Police. Should this be true, it will  signal the end of discussions relating to point one in the  second round of the Lusaka peace talks.    The UNITA communique came as no surprise to the Angolan  Government team, whose officials believe that UNITA constantly  resorts to such ploys when discussions concerning a point on the  agenda are drawing to a close, particularly if the mediator is  absent.    When asked whether the talks might break down as a result of  these new developments, officials on both sides said they did  not believe that would happen. Nevertheless, UN Special  Representative Blondin Beye will have to work very hard to  restore optimism to the talks, when he comes back. [end  recording]     "

Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, said he would formally propose the new round of talks when ministers from the 'contact group' nations of the US, Russia, France, Germany and the UK meet in Brussels on Friday. Contact group envoys travelled to Bosnia yesterday for talks aimed at getting the warring sides to agree to come back to the bargaining table, while Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary general, also came to Sarajevo in a bid to salvage the battered credibility of his organisation. In what a UN official decribed as a 'critical, high- stakes' mission, Mr Boutros Ghali will meet Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic and Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and lay out the conditions for the continuation of the UN operation in Bosnia. He will try to broker a ceasefire in the war-torn territory, and, in particular, around Bihac, the north-western Moslem enclave, where infantry clashes yesterday were reported to the west of the UN 'safe area'. Mr Boutros Ghali is expected to meet an angry reception in Sarajevo, where many resent the UN's failure to lift the 32-month Serb siege. His last visit in December 1992 is remembered bitterly for his remarks that he could think of a dozen places even worse than Sarajevo. His visit coincides with intense diplomatic efforts to overcome deep splits in the international community over Bosnia and the peace process. In a bid to get the Bosnian Serbs to return to the bargaining table, meanwhile, envoys from the five-nation contact group yesterday also travelled to Sarajevo, for talks with the Moslem-led Bosnian govern ment. The representatives were also due to meet Bosnian Serb leaders for the first time since they rejected a western peace plan - a partition of Bosnia - in July. This meeting followed talks with President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia in Belgrade on Monday. The contact group has been split in recent days by sharp disagreements over policy, but the US has shifted its position towards that of its European allies in an effort to salvage Nato unity. The international mediators appear to hold out hope of reviving their peace plan to divide Bosnia roughly in half between the Moslem-Croat federation and the Bosnian Serbs, who control 70 per cent of the war-torn country. The peace process will get an additional boost when Serb rebels from Croatia sign an agreement on Thursday on restoring economic links with Zagreb, the Croat capital. A close associate of Mr Milosevic yesterday said Belgrade would maintain a direct link with Serb-held territory in Croatia, which would step up pressure on the Bosnian Serbs to sign a peace deal. But the Bosnian Serb leadership, which over the past two weeks has revelled in the eruption of a serious transatlantic feud over Bosnia, is waiting for territorial concessions. James Blitz adds: Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, highlighted the fears of European governments over the growing violence in Bosnia by raising the possibility that UN troops might have to be withdrawn from the region. Mr Major told MPs in the House of Commons that he had been angered by 'lurid and misplaced criticism' of Unprofor which had appeared in the US press in recent days. He said the protection forces in Bosnia were not a combat force and had not been equipped for such a role.   Countries:-  BAZ  Bosnia-Hercegovina, East Europe.     GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Bosnian Moslem and Croat leaders last night signed the remaining documents in the peace package proposed by international mediators. But the Bosnian Serbs maintained their refusal to endorse the most controversial elements of the peace plan, notably the map of the 10 semi-autonomous provinces into which Bosnia would be divided. It was nevertheless the first significant development in the negotiations in New York chaired by Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen since all the warring Bosnian parties endorsed the mediators' constitutional framework for Bosnia in Geneva at the start of the year. The United Nations Security Council last night welcomed the signing of the documents and called for a 'cessation of hostilities by all parties' in Bosnia. It said it stood ready to take the 'steps required' to bring a peace settlement - an indication it could tighten economic and political sanctions if necessary to put pressure on the Serbs. After talks with General Philippe Morillon, the commander of UN forces in Bosnia, Mr Milosevic offered to host ceasefire talks between Gen Morillon and Gen Ratko Mladic, the commander of the Bosnian Serb army in Belgrade today. 'We want to support efforts . . . for a complete ceasefire in Bosnia-Hercegovina,' Mr Milosevic said. He has voiced similar sentiments before, and the real test of his sincerity will be the extent to which he is prepared to put pressure on both Gen Mladic and Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader. The immediate effect of yesterday's signing by Moslems and Croats of the provincial map and interim arrangements for the administration of Bosnia until elections are held, is to isolate Mr Karadzic. In Washington, the White House, echoing a television interview given by President Bill Clinton on Wednesday night, said that arming Bosnia's Moslems would have to be an option to be considered if the Vance-Owen peace process failed because of Serb intransigence. However, Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, cautioned against the selective lifting of the UN arms embargo on the former Yugoslavia. Among the objections to such a step were the difficulty of securing united Security Council approval and the additional threats that might be posed to existing humanitarian operations in Bosnia. Instead, Mr Hurd envisaged a further tightening of the economic embargo on the rump Yugoslavia, exempting only humanitarian supplies, but involving air, sea and river blockades, particularly on the Danube, and the impounding of cargoes. After hesitating for many weeks, Mr Alijah Izetbegovic finally signed both the map dividing Bosnia into 10 semi-autonomous provinces and the interim arrangements covering the period between the conclusion of a peace settlement and the holding of elections in Bosnia.

A draft statement issued by a Norwegian Foreign Ministry official, said: 'The two delegations went home for consultations and will meet again in the next few days.' The Norway talks were supposed to resolve differences between the two sides which have held up phase one of implementation of the peace agreement: an Israeli military withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and West Bank area of Jericho. Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, said before the end of the talks in Norway that he would only attend a critical summit scheduled later this week with Mr Yassir Arafat, Palestine Liberation Organisation chairman, if progress was made in Norway. Cabinet ministers who met in Jerusalem stressed that the government was united in refusing to make any compromise with the PLO over control of borders - the issue at the hear of the disagreement between the two sides. Officials said Israel wanted Mr Arafat to withdraw his demand for joint control and joint patrols on the borders between the Gaza Strip and Egypt and between the West Bank area of Jericho and Jordan. In return Israel, would allow a substantial Palestinian presence at the borders and would be more conciliatory on the other outstanding differences: the size of the Jericho area and the role of the Israeli army in protecting settlers who will continue to live in Gaza-Jericho. Officials say that behind the differences is a misunderstanding between the two sides, with Mr Arafat trying to win symbols of sovereignty from Israel in an effort to portray the interim self-rule period as the embryo of a Palestinian state. 'There is a basic gap in positions,' Mr Benjamin Ben Eliezer, housing minister, said. 'Yassir Arafat thinks that this is a process to establish a Palestinian state. We are talking only about a transitional period of autonomy to test whether co-existence is possible.' The gap between the two sides appears not to have been bridged in Norway, and the announcement that both sides were returning home for further consultation before another round of talks was seen in Jerusalem as meaning an inevitable further delay in the summit meeting. Both sides fear that further delays will fuel spiralling Arab-Jewish violence by extremists bent on sabotaging the peace agreement. Officials said the decision to resume talks at a country mansion in southeastern Norway, site of the secret talks which produced the Israeli-Palestinian agreement last September, was taken as both sides trusted the Norwegian brokers and had failed to make any progress in bilateral talks.

By NORMAN KEMPSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER      WASHINGTON      Former President Jimmy Carter said Tuesday that Syrian President Hafez Assad,  for years a leader of the Arab ""rejection front"" that is opposed to any  relationship with Israel, is ready to acknowledge Israel's right to exist and  to engage in direct peace negotiations with Jerusalem.    Carter, who held 7 1/2 hours of talks with Assad in Damascus earlier this  month, said the Syrian leader authorized him to report that Syria is ready to  talk about a peace treaty to replace the hostile truce that has prevailed since  the end of the 1973 Middle East War.    ""There is no doubt in my mind that Assad's attitude toward the peace process is  much more constructive than it was before,"" Carter said in a speech to the  Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.    Carter left little doubt that Assad's acceptance of Israel's continued  existence is based more on a recognition of harsh political reality than on a  change of heart.    Assad has not dropped his insistence on an international conference as the  vehicle for Middle East peace negotiations, Carter said, but the Syrian  president now is ready to move directly from the conference to face-to-face  talks with Israel. This procedure is at the heart of the peace plan advocated  by former U.S. Secretary of State George P. Shultz.    Carter said Assad envisions a conference attended by the United States, the  Soviet Union, Britain, France, China, Israel and the Arab nations as a forum  for public debate, while acknowledging that the real negotiations would be held  directly with Israel.    ""He was ready to adjourn immediately after expressing Syria's best case to the  world, to (move to) direct bilateral talks with Israel in order to resolve all  the differences that exist between Syria and Israel,"" Carter said.    He added that Assad said he agrees that the international conference should  have no power to impose an accord or to veto any pact hammered out between  Israel and the Arabs. In the past, Assad insisted that the international panel  must have real powers.    Israel has objected to the international conference format because it has  feared that the outside powers might side with the Arabs to force a settlement  on Israel.    In Israel, a spokesman for Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said Carter made no  mention of any switch in Syrian policy.    ""Not a word,"" said Avi Pazner, the spokesman. ""I was present when Carter met  with the prime minister, and there was no talk of something so dramatic.""    Carter visited Israel after his talks with Assad in Damascus.    A State Department official said Assad's private acknowledgement to Carter of  Israel's right to exist stops far short of a public statement by the Syrian  leader.    However, William B. Quandt, a Middle East expert during the Carter  Administration and now on the staff of the Brookings Institution, said that  Assad seems to have gone beyond his former position.    ""My guess is there is some real movement, but it is hard to say how much and  how serious and what the intentions are,"" Quandt said.    Syria broke diplomatic relations with Egypt in 1978 after the late President  Anwar Sadat agreed to negotiate a peace with Israeli Prime Minister Menachem  Begin.    Carter said that Assad might have been motivated by a realization that the  Soviet Union, Syria's chief arms supplier, would be unwilling to support  another war against Israel.    Carter said he believes that Assad would agree to a treaty that would turn the  Golan Heights into a demilitarized zone.

The Russian diplomats are keeping the text of  the message a secret.    The outcome of the Palestinians' peace talks with Israel  depends on Syria' stance. It was owing to Syria's and Jordan's  refusal to continue the talks following the Hebron massacre that  the Arab-Israeli negotiating process ran into delay five weeks  ago.    What is more, it has not proved possible to organize  bilateral talks between Syria and the Jewish state, prompting  Russia -- as one of the two sponsors of the Near East settlement  process -- to pay particular attention to President Hafiz  al-Asad.    Following his visit to Damascus I. Ivanov returned to Moscow  while V. Posuvalyuk went on to Amman to hand the King of Jordan  a message from Yeltsin.    The high-ranking Foreign Ministry staffers' visit to  Damascus  and Amman obviously marks a fresh attempt by Russian diplomacy  to preserve its role as one of the patrons of the Near East  negotiating process after Moscow's recent peace initiative  failed to meet with support from the parties to this process.    The boost to Russian foreign policy in the region is  occurring amid the resumption of the peace process. Talks  between the Israelis and the PLO have continued in Cairo.  [passage omitted]     "

The latest tour of Israel and Tunisia made by Russia's  Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev made it crystal clear that  Russia has been back to the Middle East peace drive.    Since peace negotiations were first set in motion in Madrid  in October 1991, Russia's role has not been particularly  significant as Russia's participation has only been in  accordance with formalities.    Now, Russia is not anymore hesitant to take attitudes which  are inconsistent with those taken by the United States.    It also stressed that it could take advantage of its  traditional influence with Palestinians and some Arab countries  to help revive the PLO-Israeli peace negotiations, suspended  since the Hebron massacre of at least 30 Palestinian worshippers  in Ibrahimi Mosque on February 25.    Russia has declared that it supports the Palestinian demands  of providing protection for the Palestinian people in the  occupied lands and has proposed that another international  conference, along the lines of the Madrid Conference, be held to  break the stalemate of the peace talks, though the U.S. and  Israel have rejected this proposal.    Kozyrev toured Israel and Tunisia Friday [11 March] for  talks  with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and PLO Chairman Yasir  'Arafat on ways of continuing PLO-Israeli negotiations, with  emphasis on the draft resolution put to the U.N. Security  Council on the Hebron massacre.    After his talks with 'Arafat, Kozyrev said the PLO chairman  has signaled willingness to continue negotiating with Israel,  while 'Arafat said that the Palestinian leadership expects  obvious and explicit guarantees from the co-sponsors of the U.S.  and Russia for safeguarding the Palestinian people in the  occupied Arab territories as well as Islamic and Christian  shrines.    As Kozyrev was having talks with 'Arafat in Tunis, Russia's  representative to the U.N. put forward a draft resolution on the  Hebron massacre to the Security Council.    Official Palestinian sources said that the U.S. and Israel  said they are not satisfied with the provisions of the draft  resolution on the Hebron massacre now discussed by the Security  Council, but they are ready to accept it should the PLO be  committed to continuing PLO-Israeli negotiations.    The sources said that the draft resolution condemns the  Hebron massacre, calls for international presence in the  occupied Arab territories and urges the Israeli Government to  take further measures to disarm Jewish settlers in the occupied  lands.    The resolution also asks the U.S. and Russia to monitor the  implementation of the resolution, which is expected to be voted  Monday.    Tunis-based Arab diplomatic sources said that Russia's  flurry  of diplomatic activity in the Middle East can further strengthen  the Palestinians' attitude and exert pressure on Israel and the  U.S. to help speed up the Middle East peace process.

He began  his talks in a meeting with Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz at the  Foreign Ministry. After a news conference, the two proceeded to  the Presidential Palace, where a meeting was held with President  Ilyas al-Hirawi, Chamber of Deputies Speaker Nabih Birri, and  Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri. President al-Hirawi held a  dinner banquet in honor of Hurd, which was attended by Birri,  al-Hariri, Buwayz, and a number of ministers.    At a news conference following his talks with Buwayz, the  British foreign secretary said that his visit to Beirut has two  goals: The first is to learn all the latest developments  regarding the peace process that pertain to Lebanon. He said:  We in Britain realize that peace must be comprehensive and  involve an agreement between Israel and Lebanon as well as the  implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 425 to open the  way for the implementation of the al-Ta'if Agreement and to  enable Lebanon to regain its full independence. This is  important to us.    Hurd added: The second goal goes beyond the peace process.  You in Lebanon are embarking on a reconstruction process after  the war with skill, enthusiasm, and dynamism, as anyone would  expect from the Lebanese on economic issues. I am anxious to  understand what is happening so that we in Britain can translate  this into cooperation and assistance, and this is what I did. I  am pleased to note that our British exports to Lebanon increased  quickly in the last month of last year. I am very pleased that  British companies are interested in the airport project. I hope  that the increasing exchange of trade and ministerial visits  will help promote such cooperation.    He added: I want cooperation to expand to include the  cultural field, cooperation between our armed forces, and  cooperation in combating drug trafficking.    Hurd explained that he did not come as a mediator in the  Middle East negotiations. But Britain has an interest in the  success of the peace process, and if it can do something to  help, it will do so without becoming a mediator.    Hurd said: Lebanon is a principal partner in the Middle East  peace process. Peace must be comprehensive. We welcomed the  September agreement between the PLO and Israel. We think that  this is a very important step forward. But it is clear to me  that it will not become final until agreements are concluded  between Israel and Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon. We are  maintaining close contacts with the Jordanians, the Israelis,  and the Syrians. He noted that the summit meeting between  Presidents Clinton and al-Asad is very important and expressed  the hope that it will advance the negotiations on the  Syrian-Israeli track and make it possible to overcome the  difficulties. He noted that he is in touch with the U.S.  secretary of state on the peace process.    Hurd affirmed Britain's support for UN Security Council  Resolution 425 and said: All these matters are linked to the  al-Ta'if Agreement, which we strongly support. These matters  must be implemented in stages. Resolution 425 and the al-Ta'if  Agreement-- which we support--are the basis for progress and for  Lebanon regaining its complete freedom.    Minister Buwayz said:    [Begin recording] [Buwayz] I would like first to welcome His  Excellency Minister Douglas Hurd on his visit to Lebanon. As  you know, and as I have already said during my visit to the  United Kingdom, Britain has a long history that qualifies it to  understand the problems of this area. There is no doubt that as  Arab foreign ministers we have repeatedly called for effective  participation by the European countries. When we refer to the  European countries, we include Britain, of course. We think  that in view of Britain's historical role in the Middle East, it  is qualified to play a role in bilateral negotiations and in the  peace process.    The talks between us dealt with the regional situation, the  peace process, and ways to promote economic and cultural  cooperation between Lebanon and Britain. We think that  Lebanon's democracy, its free economic system, and the  effectiveness of the Lebanese private sector provide numerous  common denominators between the two countries and peoples and  make it possible to discuss ways for fruitful cooperation.    [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, did Secretary Hurd suggest  anything new to advance the peace process?    [Buwayz] Mr. Hurd is closely following the peace process.  There is no doubt that as a result of his visit and becoming  acquainted with the Lebanese views on the occupied territory in  the south, he will be able to play a role in one way or another.    [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, [words indistinct]  implementation of Resolution 425?    [Buwayz] I think that you have heard Mr. Hurd clearly state  Britain's frank position on this resolution. I imagine that  Britain is known for its firm views and positions.    [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, do you regard the British role  today as complementing the U.S. role [words indistinct]?    [Buwayz] I imagine that there is cooperation between  Britain,  the United States, and a number of European states to promote  the peace process.    [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, what about the British role in  the reconstruction of Lebanon? Were there new developments on  this matter?    [Buwayz] Of course, we held talks on this matter. As you  know, British companies specialize in various sectors. I think  that Britain is interested in Lebanon because of its democratic  system and free economy and because of the things we have in  common. [end recording]     "

In an interview with the newspaper AL-AHRAM to be published  in its 17 April issue, Rabin said that in a telephone  conversation following the Israeli bus blast, he and Palestinian  Chairman Yasir 'Arafat agreed on the need to continue the peace  process, because it is the best response to the enemies of peace  by the Israeli and the Palestinian sides.    The Israeli prime minister affirmed that the objective of  U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's visit to the region  at the end of this month is to boost the multilateral talks and  to attend the signing of the agreement on implementing the  Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles, if they reach  agreement.    Rabin clarified that the peace efforts with the Palestinians  must proceed simultaneously along two parallel roads,  concentrating on the negotiations to reach agreement on  implementing the Gaza-Jericho First agreement and to confirm  that violence and terrorism will not hamper the negotiating  process or attempts to reach agreement to implement the  Declaration of Principles.    Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin said in his interview  with AL-AHRAM that agreement was reached between the Palestinian  and the Israeli sides in a meeting in Cairo recently that  anything that is agreed upon during the talks will be written  down and initialed.    He pointed out that what Israel is trying to do with the  Palestinians is to find a formula for peaceful coexistence  without any clear or dividing lines, because there are no  dividing lines in reality. In this context, he mentioned the  corridor linking Gaza and Jericho.    Rabin said he would head for Moscow on April 24 to meet  Russian President Boris Yeltsin. This visit will be preceded by  another visit by Palestinian president Yasir 'Arafat to Moscow.  But Rabin ruled out the possibility of a meeting between him  and 'Arafat then.    Rabin said that Israel tried to start secret talks with  Syria  but that Damascus refused to cooperate, despite the fact that  none of the agreements between the Arabs and Israel since 1977  could have taken place had they not been preceded by secret  talks.    Answering a question on relations between Israel and the  Arab  countries, Rabin said that peace between Egypt and Israel broke  the hostility between Israel and the Arab countries. He stated:  Undoubtedly, Egypt is the biggest and most important Arab  country. Peace with Egypt has proven that peace can be  established and preserved.    On the siege imposed on Gaza and the West Bank towns, the  Israeli prime minister denied that there are any instructions  banning the entry of food and medicine to the Gaza Strip. He  said he agreed to exclude doctors, nurses, and Palestinian  employees of international organizations from the ban on  entering and leaving the occupied territories.     "

This Syrian desire to achieve a just and  comprehensive peace was not conceived on the spur of the moment,  but a strategy that has been adopted by Syria for many years.  The objective of peace has been, and still is, the heart of  Syria's policy. Syria has responded positively to every call or  initiative to establish peace based on the resolutions of  international legitimacy and the return of Arab rights to their  owners.    Since past initiatives have not achieved their objectives,  and the last two and a half years of talks have not achieved  peace thus far, we must lay the blame at the feet of the  Israelis. Israel has foiled each and every call or initiative  to achieve peace in the past, obstructed and hampered the  current peace process, and prevented the achievement of any  results worth mentioning.    Today, it seems there will be a new opportunity to push the  peace process forward if Israel abandons its previous stands and  deals positively with the substantive queries the U.S. secretary  of state carried with him from Damascus. The queries deal with  the basic issues and not with formalities and unimportant  issues. We do not believe the bases of a just and comprehensive  peace need further explanation or clarification, for the peace  process is based on specific and clear principles; namely, the  UN resolutions and the land-for-peace principle. When all the  parties declare their adherence to these principles, then peace  will be within reach. The more this or that party departs from  these principles, the more dim become the prospects to achieve  peace.    Syria has announced its stand toward peace. It is a stand  based on the UN resolutions and the land-for-peace principle.  This stand has not and will not change. By the same token,  Syria is concerned about establishing the peace of the brave in  the region, and is committed to the peace process until it  achieves its goals; it adheres to its right to restore every  inch of the Golan and the occupied territories.    Syria said it will not accept half solutions and partial  withdrawals. Moreover, it did not take part in the Madrid  conference and the Washington negotiations to bargain over its  territory and rights, but joined the peace process out of its  desire for a just and honorable peace and because the peace  initiative is based on UN Security Council Resolutions 242 and  338, which are in harmony with Syria's peace strategy.    Any peace that is not established on firm bases will be  threatened with collapse at any time. Any peace that does not  liberate all the occupied Arab territories and restore all the  usurped rights cannot be established. It is either  comprehensive peace or no peace. Withdrawal must also be full,  for it is impossible to achieve peace with the continuation of  occupation. Syria has sought and is still seeking a just and  comprehensive peace that can last and hold. This peace, which  is based on the resolutions of international legitimacy, is the  only means to end the whirlpool of wars and aggression, and  restore rights to their owners. If the other party is ready for  such peace, it will find reciprocation from Syria. Only then,  can the peace process proceed toward the objective aspired by  the region and the world. The ball is still in the Israeli  court. Israel must answer these substantive queries. And, in  light of their answers, we can then talk about the progress or  retreat of the peace process. The opportunity is still  available to achieve the aspired peace.     "
0,FT942-16805 ,"FT942-16805 _AN-EDHDEAB7FT 940408   FT  08 APR 94 / Adams dashes hopes of ceasefire extension      By MICHAEL CASSELL, TIM COONE and DAVID OWEN   Hopes that the IRA might react to widespread pressure by extending its three-day ceasefire, which ends at midnight tonight, appear to have been dashed by Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein. With Downing Street yesterday rejecting Mr Adams' latest request for direct talks, and the IRA facing renewed calls from Dublin, nationalist politicians and church leaders to prolong the ceasefire, the Sinn Fein president said he believed it was 'unlikely, even logistically, for the IRA to extend its suspension'. With the ceasefire drawing to an end and fears rising of a return to violence in the province, both sides were trying to hold each other responsible for the deadlock in the peace process. Downing Street last night formally rebuffed Sinn Fein's demand for direct dialogue, denying that London had brought about a stalemate. But its carefully crafted two-page letter was markedly less blunt than the curt four-paragraph response it made to a previous letter from Mr Adams in January. Yesterday's response, signed by a senior official, said any pause in the movement towards peace was 'because of the continuing violence, and Sinn Fein's failure unequivocally to renounce violence as a means of achieving political ends'. Downing Street also reiterated Mr John Major's pledge that the government would be ready to enter preliminary dialogue with Sinn Fein 'within three months' in the event of a permanent end to violence and a commitment by Sinn Fein to the democratic process. Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, yesterday broke off his holiday in Cyprus to say that an extension to the ceasefire was 'essential' if the strong momentum for peace was to be maintained. His message was repeated in a hard-hitting speech by Mr Dick Spring, Irish foreign minister, who called the IRA ceasefire 'pathetically brief' and called for it to be permanently extended. Mr Spring used a conference in County Kerry to challenge republican leaders to display 'vision and courage to build', rather than to destroy. He insisted that the Downing Street declaration remained the only way forward for political progress in Northern Ireland and that a renewal of violence would 'not appreciably change the basic realities in the declaration'. He said Sinn Fein's failure to specify its concerns over the declaration had given rise to 'understandable worries' that the party's aim was to draw both governments 'into a world of verbal mirrors and shifting goalposts' and to enter political negotiations 'on a basis of armed conflict'. Mr Spring also criticised unionist leaders for their 'dogmatic refusal' to join talks, which he said they should do out of 'enlightened self-interest'.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

The talks, centring on the transfer of limited powers to the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho, are due to be completed by mid-December. The Palestinians, while welcoming this week's release of 617 prisoners, stressed that many more of the estimated 11,000 still held had to be freed to win greater popular support. They insisted that prisoners from factions other than Fatah, headed by Mr Yassir Arafat, had to be included. 'We are not happy,' Palestinian delegate Ziad Abu Ziad said. 'We are trying to make peace between Palestinians and Israelis, not between Israel and a faction of the Palestine Liberation Organisation. If peace has a broader base it will have wider support.' Israel has so far refused to free prisoners belonging to radical Islamic groups, such as Hamas and Islamic Jihad. Premier Yitzhak Rabin of Israel said yesterday that the agreement with the PLO provided only for the release of a limited number of prisoners at this stage. How many more could be freed would depend on progress made in the peace talks. In Damascus, one of the radical Palestinian groups opposed to the outline peace agreement said it had agreed with Fatah to end clashes in the Gaza strip. The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine said the agreement was reached during talks between representatives of both groups.   Countries:-  ILZ  Israel, Middle East.

MTA claimed in a statement yesterday it had killed 150 of  Rangoon's troops and injured about 100 others.    The statement claimed the MTA had also captured three  government bases and destroyed a dam which has flooded the Mae  Sai River near Tachilek.    The main column of MTA soldiers have moved closer to  Tachilek, a government-controlled border town opposite here, MTA  sources claimed.    The opium warlord's army lost 17 guerrillas and suffered 39  injuries during the fighting described as the heaviest in 40  years.    The war has sent a large number of Burmese villagers across  the border but many have been sent back by Thai authorities who  have beefed up security along the border to prevent the fighting  from spilling over.    Troops from the Third Army and Border Patrol policemen have  been sent to man border passes along the Thai-Burmese frontier.    Tachilek has been nearly deserted since the fighting began.    Young men have left the town to stay closer to the border in  apparent preparation to cross over leaving women children and  the aged behind for fear of being recruited to become arms  porters.    The Burmese border town, which only days ago was bustling  with trading activity, has become quiet because of the drastic  drop in Thai and foreign tourist arrivals.    Tachilek is now being defended by about 500 government  troops.    Military sources said Rangoon's military drive against Khun  Sa's MTA was aimed at opening up a strategic route in the Shan  State for the government force to attack three minority rebel  groups along the Thai western border.    The sources claimed SLORC [State Law and Order Restoration  Council] planned to open an all-out military campaign against  the Karen National Union [KNU], the Karenni Nation Progress  Party [KNPP] and the New Mon [State] Party [NMSP] if peace talks  failed.    Rangoon has negotiated a peace settlement with eight  northern  minority groups. The Kachin Independent Organisation, the  second largest member of the anti-Rangoon Democratic Alliance of  Burma [DAB] has become the latest rebel movement to lay down  arms.    No headway has been made in peace talks between SLORC and  the  KNU, the KNPP and the NMSP because Rangoon wants negotiations to  be held in Burma and the others, especially the KNU, which is  the largest member of the DAB, wants the talks in a neutral  country.    The sources said Rangoon was expected to declare all-out war  with the three rebel factions if the peace talks failed, by  telling the world it had done its best to stop the armed  struggle.     "

0,FT941-5647 ,"FT941-5647 _AN-ECFAYAA2FT 940305   FT  05 MAR 94 / Middle East peace process on the rack: The Hebron massacre has left PLO leaders enfeebled and put the talks with Israel in jeopardy      By MARK NICHOLSON   In public the leaders of the Palestine Liberation Organisation in Tunis this week have expressed deep anxiety over the prospects of salvaging the peace process in the aftermath of the Hebron massacre. In private Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO chairman, and his close lieutenants are near to desperation. Not since Mr Arafat's famous White House handshake with Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, to seal the outline accord on Palestinian self-rule and Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho, has the credibility of that deal looked in greater jeopardy. Neither, in the eyes of Mr Arafat's rioting constituency in the occupied territories, has that of the Tunis-based PLO leadership who negotiated that deal in secret Oslo talks. Mr Arafat will not have needed the television pictures of Palestinian militants burning his effigy last week to impress on him the gravity of the threat to his already waning authority within the territories. Several PLO leaders in Tunis also received threats to their lives from Palestinian groups this week. But the uncomfortable truth for Mr Arafat and his colleagues is that, from their distant villas in suburban Tunis, they see little they can do to inject any impetus to the peace process. The Palestinian negotiators of the Oslo accord say they cannot hope for the minimum popular support for resumed talks without, at the very least, more substantial guarantees for the protection of Palestinians from militant settlers than Israel has so far offered. For this, they are depending upon the unlikely prospect of these being volunteered by the Rabin government, or perhaps forced upon it by international and, specifically, US pressure. Palestinian support for the Oslo accord, and for Mr Arafat himself, were diminishing fast enough in the territories before the Hebron massacre. Twelve weeks have passed since the supposed deadline for the start of an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho without the PLO leadership having anything to show for it on the ground. Even the ever-optimistic Mr Nabil Shaath, the chief PLO negotiator in the Gaza-Jericho talks, felt that three more painstaking weeks of talks were in prospect to complete the deal before the Hebron killings landmined the process. Since Hebron, PLO leaders now speak of the situation in the territories as 'explosive' and 'volcanic'. According to Mr Ahmad Quorieh (Abu Ala), one of the negotiators and most ardent proponents of the Oslo deal, 'the seeds of a real conflict have been sown'. The PLO leadership in Tunis is watching with horror the potential for a renewed, full-blooded  - and for them uncontrollable - intifada (uprising), and one largely founded on frustration with their efforts. Senior PLO officials see no way out of the crisis other than by politically acceptable measures from Israel, a return to negotiations on the Gaza-Jericho accord, and its swift implementation. 'That accord will be enough if the Israelis begin to take real measures that people can see,' says Mr Quorieh, who also warns that the whole process may be at stake if the original April 13 deadline for withdrawal is missed. And although some PLO leaders said this week that these talks can only resume if Israel begins to discuss the future of the settlements in the occupied territories - which is unlikely - they have in fact set far more modest 'requirements' for returning to the peace table. These are an 'international presence' to ensure security for Palestinians and 'further' disarming of militant settlers than Mr Rabin has offered. PLO officials say they cannot believe these gestures are beyond the Israeli cabinet's ability to deliver. 'Both we and the Israelis took a risk when we entered into this process,' says Mr Abed Rabbo. 'We have to take a risk now.' In fact, the PLO is also taking a risk with what it considers the modesty of its 'requirements'. PLO leaders express the hope, rather than any firm conviction, that if they are met and talks resumed, this might be enough to quell the anger in the territories. But as one Tunis-based diplomat puts it: 'How much cheer will the people in the territories get from seeing the resumption of talks, when all they've seen from them is delays?' If the Gaza-Jericho talks can somehow be hauled back on track, the premium will be upon concluding them rapidly. But this will be difficult. Not only is there much to resolve in the security talks - Israeli officials have not been as optimistic as Mr Shaath in this respect - but parallel talks in Paris on the economic aspects of self-rule are much further from resolution. In addition, diplomats in Tunis seriously doubt whether the PLO would be ready by April 13 to assume their responsibilities after an Israeli withdrawal. A Palestinian police force is far from readiness, committees and administrators remain to be named. And while the post-Hebron crisis commands the full attention of Mr Arafat and his small coterie of trusted leaders, decisions on these and a host of other matters are being further delayed. In the meantime, the PLO leadership can only lobby and hope that the political mood in the occupied territories does not spin irrecoverably out of their control. For the moment, neither Mr Arafat nor the other executive committee members of the PLO sound optimistic. Three weeks ago the PLO chairman said he thought the peace process was losing credibility. This week, asked whether Palestinians would back him if he simply decided to resume the peace talks in the absence of further concessions, he replied: 'No, frankly. No. Because the peace process has lost credibility.' Mr Arafat knows his own credibility in the territories is also now in the gravest doubt. And barely anyone believes the present fragile peace process could survive the final loss of that.   Countries:-  ILZ  Israel, Middle East.     TNZ  Tunisia, Africa.

0,FT933-15138 ,"FT933-15138 _AN-DGKANABCFT 930710   FT  10 JUL 93 / Row hampers talks on Ulster      By RALPH ATKINS   SIR PATRICK Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, is to try again to cajole unionist and nationalist leaders back into 'round-table' talks - in spite of a yawning gap that has emerged between the British and Irish governments. The row over Northern Ireland's future that erupted on Thursday may signal the end of a common approach between the two governments. As if conceding that talks will not re-start in the autumn, as envisaged by the UK, the Irish government is floating the possibility of the two governments going over the heads of local politicians. Mr Dick Spring, Irish foreign minister, has gone further. He has raised the idea of 'joint sovereignty' in Ulster. He was slapped down on Thursday by Sir Patrick. Mr Spring had broken the 'cardinal principle' that agreement must be reached by consent. The squall reflects shifts in thinking both in London and Dublin. The British government has become more overtly unionist. More importantly, the prime minister departed from the usual script - that Northern Ireland should remain part of the UK so long as a majority of its population wished to remain - to say he was behind the union. The shift may be partly because of the Conservatives' increased reliance on the votes of Ulster Unionist MPs at Westminster. More probably, it is just that the frustration of failing to re-start talks has provoked frank opinions. Irish officials believe unionists must not be allowed to make the running. But Mr Spring is also keen to make a mark for his Irish Labour party, the junior partner in the Irish government coalition. There is a desire to build on the 1985 Anglo-Irish agreement which gave Dublin a token say in the affairs of the north. What will happen next? The most optimistic scenario is that unionists will be so encouraged by the UK's apparently hardened line that they will re-enter talks, dropping their insistance that the Irish government has first to modify its constitutional claim on the north. Perversely, a row between the British and Irish governments may soothe unionist fears about their constitutional future. More realistically, however, the Irish government's remarks will only further delay the resumption of talks. So Mr Spring's remarks could become self-fulfilling and the only way ahead would be for the two governments to come together and map out a future for Northern Ireland.

Speaking after Saturday's [19 February] 90-minute meeting in  London with Mr. Major, the Taoiseach [prime minister] warned the  IRA and Sinn Fein they would not have a better opportunity to  enter the political process. He denied setting a deadline of  March 17 for a Sinn Fein response to the Downing Street peace  declaration. Both he and Mr. Major had made it clear the door  to peace would not be closed, said Mr. Reynolds.    ""We are not closing the door to peace, we are not going to  lock that door and throw away the key."" But he added: ""I do not  think the overwhelming support of the Irish people can be  ignored. This is a new opportunity, there is never going to be  a better offer on the table and I cannot see what justification  there would be for the continuation of violence or the taking of  one more innocent life.""    During their meeting at Downing Street on Saturday both  leaders agreed to resume the three-strand Northern Ireland talks  process.    Mr. Reynolds told Irish radio the talks would be based on  the  principles enshrined in the declaration. ""The new starting  point will be the peace declaration. That has not been clear up  to now, we finally agreed it on Saturday. We also agreed that  it is a three-stranded process and not an internal settlement as  some people were suggesting.""    Mr. Reynolds said it was helpful that Mr. Major had  reaffirmed his commitment to the declaration. ""It was important  that the British prime minister said it because I think there  were people who were suspecting that maybe the British  Government in some way or another were not behind the  declaration.""    Mr. Reynolds quashed hopes that the Sinn Fein annual  conference next weekend would deliver a response to the Downing  St. declaration, saying: ""I never expected that forum to be the  forum at which the response would be put together."" But he  hoped sufficient people would recognise that the road to peace  was ""a better road to choose to pursue their political  objectives rather than the road to violence which in the last 25  years has been carried on by paramilitaries on both sides.  There will be no military victories.""    Mr. Reynolds said: ""We want people to sit back, study  exactly  where they have come from, where they are at and which road has  the best chance of advancing the cause of nationalism. We  believe the peace process is the only road.""    Earlier, Mr. Reynolds told BBC Radio 4's The World This  Weekend that progress was likely within a month.    ""Saturday's meeting cleared the air and we have now agreed  on  the basis for the new talks, which is that the peace declaration  will form the basis for the resumption of talks. That will be  the new starting point,"" he said.    And Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew told the  same programme that no party, including the Rev. Ian Paisley's  hardline Democratic Unionists, could be allowed to veto progress  of the peace talks.    Meanwhile, Irish Deputy Premier Dick Spring called on the  IRA  and Sinn Fein to show ""leadership and courage"" and accept the  Downing Street peace declaration.    But speaking on BBC1's Breakfast With Frost programme he  conceded that the IRA and Sinn Fein might never respond to the  peace initiative.    John Hume, the SDLP [Social Democratic Labor Party] leader,  said he did not agree with the view that the Declaration was  unacceptable to Sinn Fein.    He told the London Weekend Television Walden programme: ""My  reading is that they are still giving it detailed study, which  is what I expected, given the nature of that organisation.    ""Their immediate reaction is suspicion and that is what I  expect. But they have not rejected the Declaration. They have  asked for clarification.""    Mr. Hume said that peace in Ireland was above party  politics. ""I am putting it above party politics myself in the  dialogue that I have been engaged in, so I would feel that what  the British Government should do now is to directly clarify to  them whatever they want clarified.""

They  discussed the massacre at the Sayyidat al-Najat Church in Zuq  Micha'il, developments in Lebanon, and the suspension of the  bilateral talks following the massacre at the al-Ibrahimi Mosque  in Hebron. Hambley handed President al-Hirawi a message from  U.S. President Bill Clinton expressing the feelings of the  American people and their strong support for Lebanon in foiling  the attempts of those who are trying to infringe upon its  independence.    After the meeting with President al-Hirawi, Hambley said  that  the visit was intended to express condemnation of the carnage at  the Sayyidat al-Najat Church, which caused the death of innocent  people. He reiterated his country's support for the peace  process and its emphasis on continuing these steps toward peace.  He noted that President Clinton had stressed his support for  President al-Hirawi and, through him, to the other Lebanese  leaders and people.    Responding to a question on continuing the talks after their  suspension in the wake of the Hebron massacre, Hambley said that  his country is trying to find a suitable atmosphere for a  resumption of the talks and the peace process in the region. He  noted that his country is contacting all parties and expects the  parties to resume talks in Washington soon.     "

'I believe the way ahead is clearer than many people may imagine,' he said. Everybody in Northern Ireland, the Irish Republic and in Britain wants peace, he said. Ipso facto, round-table talks on the province should resume as soon as possible. He may have been naive but the immediate effect of his speech was, on balance, positive. Talks will probably start after next month's local elections in the province - only the Rev Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionist Party appeared unhappy with that prospect last night. Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, may meet Unionist and nationalist leaders beforehand in order to pre-empt disputes over procedural points. But the government's only fresh contribution to breaking the political deadlock that has gripped the province since the 'troubles' started nearly 25 years ago was in one line at the end of Mr Major's speech: 'When they talk, we will put proposals before the participants. We must press ahead.' There were no official clues about what such government proposals might involve. But indications from Whitehall are that the package will be a synthesis of ideas already discussed by Unionist and nationalist parties during previous talks that ended in November, rather than a fresh approach. If Mr Major is to do more than act as a catalyst to talks that end, once more, in failure, the government's proposals will almost certainly have to bridge a divide that has stymied a trail of government initiatives over the past two decades. Any signs that Mr Major has found a magic formula that has proved elusive before are scant. As suspicious as ever of the UK government giving ground to the nationalists, Mr Paisley, yesterday castigated Mr Major for suggesting there was a political solution to terrorism. He wants tougher security and an end to the Irish Republic's constitutional claim on the north that gives 'oxygen' to the republican paramilitaries. More subtly, more moderate Ulster Unionist MPs were urging that Northern Ireland be treated like any other part of the UK - code for excluding the Irish Republic from any practical involvement. In contrast, Mr John Hume, leader of the mainly Roman Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party, wants Northern Ireland's political machinery set firmly in an all-Ireland context. Such complexities could emerge in discussions on how talks resume. Unionists want low-key bilateral talks focused on restoring democracy to the province and attach priority to Dublin giving way on its constitutional claims. The SDLP will want assurances that there will not be interim agreement on any proposals until the whole agenda has been resolved - including Northern Ireland's position within the British Isles. Building on public revulsion at recent terrorist atrocities, Mr Major appeared to have won enough goodwill to ensure such obstacles to talks will be overcome. But it will only be a return to where the politicians were last November.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P9111 Executive Offices.     P8651 Political Organizations.

Department spokeswoman Christine Shelly,  commenting on Pyongyang's statement that the Armistice Agreement  is null and should be replaced by a peace pact, said that ""We  cannot accept its claim that the armistice is `useless' or  `invalid.'""    ""Our position is that the Armistice Agreement remains in  effect. We are proceeding on that basis,"" Shelly said.    Pyongyang officials have demanded negotiations with  Washington on the matter, a move interpreted here and in Seoul  as an attempt to blur the current international focus on the  North Korean nuclear row and to engage the United States in yet  another form of dialogue.    North Korea insists that talks on the peace agreement should  be held exclusively between it and the United States since South  Korea is not a signatory of the 1953 armistice pact.    ""...We note that in February 1992, North and South Korea  agreed that questions of peace and security on the peninsula  should be resolved primarily through inter-Korean dialogue,""  said Shelly. ""We strongly support that approach.""    The spokeswoman added that Washington will abort all talks  with Pyongyang if the latter goes ahead and refuels a nuclear  reactor without the presence of International Atomic Energy  Agency (IAEA) experts. North Korean officials have repeatedly  threatened to go ahead with the refueling if the IAEA continues  to make inspection demands on the process.    Reminding that inter-Korean talks can play an important part  in resolving the nuclear impasse, Shelly said Washington hopes  the two Koreas will resume dialogue in the near future.     "
0,FT934-1231 ,"FT934-1231 _AN-DLUC5AAHFT 931221   FT  21 DEC 93 / Ulster peace hopes set back by amnesty demand: Sinn Fein call for release of prisoners angers Unionists      By DAVID OWEN and TIM COONE   Hopes of peace in Northern Ireland were jolted yesterday when Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, called for all IRA prisoners to be released from jail as part of a negotiated settlement. His demand angered Protestant leaders. One Ulster Unionist MP immediately warned that his party's 'tentative approval' of the Major-Reynolds peace initiative could be withdrawn. The row broke out after Downing Street again rejected an amnesty for IRA prisoners. But officials acknowledged that all prisoners could have their sentences reviewed under standard procedures which took account of their likeliness to re-offend. The dispute came as the IRA claimed responsibility for a bomb explosion which injured a soldier and a civilian in west Belfast last night. It was the first claim of responsibility since the Major-Reynolds declaration. The IRA appears to be signalling there will be no extended Christmas ceasefire before any decision to end violence. The attack followed the explosion of two incendiary devices in London during the evening which police said bore the hallmarks of the IRA. However, Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, earlier said the fact that the paramilitaries were considering the implications of the peace process was 'very encouraging'. Speaking in Brussels, where EU foreign ministers yesterday endorsed the Downing Street Declaration, Mr Spring reiterated Dublin's view that 'the whole question of prisoners' would have to be looked at if a permanent cessation of violence was achieved. Seeking to exploit a suggestion by Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, on Sunday that London might be ready to consider the future of hundreds of IRA prisoners, Mr Adams said a negotiated settlement would 'remove the symptoms as well as the causes of the conflict. 'As part of this it is obvious that all prisoners must be released,' he said. In a strongly worded statement, the Sinn Fein president also criticised Mr Reynolds' weekend warning that the IRA faced a tough security clampdown if it did not respond positively to the peace initiative. 'The issuing of ultimatums by London and Dublin while we are considering their document is most unhelpful,' he said. Mr Ken Maginnis, the Ulster Unionist security spokesman, said he was 'not at all impressed' by Mr Adams' statement and warned the two governments not to 'hand hostages to fortune' to the IRA. He said: 'We thought the joint declaration . . . was a definitive statement  -with all its shortcomings we accepted it on that basis. If we are going to go beyond the joint declaration . . . then of course there will be a very quick withdrawal of that tentative approval that has been given by the majority of people in Northern Ireland.' The government's response was welcomed by Mr James Molyneaux, the Ulster Unionist party leader, who said on BBC radio there could be no question of an amnesty for convicted criminals. If the government reneged on that 'they would be destroying the whole authority of the judicial system'. The incendiary devices in central London were at a pub in Victoria, which forced the evacuation of hundreds of passengers from the Victoria coach station, and at the Royal Mail's Mount Pleasant sorting office, just north of the City. Nobody was injured. A third device, found at a City sorting office, was made safe.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.     IEZ  Ireland, EC.   Industries:-  P9721 International Affairs.

He said yesterday that he had received 'thousands of invitations' from the US to explain the recent ceasefire declaration by Sinn Fein and the IRA, and he planned to visit as soon as possible. Mr Adams is barred from visiting the US, and his application aims to test how receptive the Washington and London governments are to the recent IRA ceasefire. A State Department official said in Washington last night that no formal visa request had been received. But if his intention was to advance the peace process Mr Adams would probably receive one. The official was also reported to have said that the Clinton administration was considering a request from a unionist delegation to visit Washington. 'I think it's safe to say that the US is going to - as President Clinton said - support this effort of peace in every possible way,' the official said. Mr Adams last applied for - and obtained - a US visa in February in spite of a strong public protest from the British government that the IRA had not renounced violence. On that occasion the White House overruled the advice of State Department officials and agreed to a 72-hour visit by Mr Adams, having become convinced that it would contribute to the peace process. White House officials who feel vindicated by that decision are likely to recommend granting a visa again, although the State Department remains sensitive to the complex issues at stake. The State Department yesterday also pointed out that the US admitted Mr Joseph Cahill, a Provisional IRA leader with a criminal conviction, at the end of last month. Senator Chris Dodd yesterday met Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish premier and suggested that Mr Adams, Mr Reynolds and Mr John Hume, leader of the mainly nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party, should visit the US to participate in a hearing on the future of Ireland before the Senate foreign relations committee. Mr Dodd, as chairman of the subcommittee on western hemisphere and Peace Corps affairs, would be one of the senators responsible for inviting Mr Adams on behalf of the Senate committee. Political aides to Mr Dodd said yesterday that the senator believes there should be a role for the US in Irish reconciliation and that 'Mr Adams should sit at the table'. The British government may formally urge President Clinton not to grant Mr Adams a visa until the IRA gives a firmer indication that it has permanently abandoned its military campaign. But officials are aware that the survival of the IRA ceasefire depends in large measure on Mr Adams being able to show his supporters that the 'unarmed struggle' is producing political results. Mr Adams plans to give his next US trip a higher profile than his last one, hoping he will be heralded as a peacemaker and not a terrorist. Will they bid for peace?

In an apparent response to the tough Palestinian action Israel quickly announced it would allow the immediate return home of 25 more of the 400 Palestinians it deported last December, in addition to the 101 whose return was agreed in January. A PLO spokesman in Tunis said the Palestinian negotiating team would be cut from 14 members to three. It would also suspend the work of three sub-committees. However, the PLO has carefully stopped short of withdrawing from the peace process, launched in Madrid 18 months ago. The Palestinian decision follows two weeks of growing frustration in Washington and worsening violence in the occupied territories. Members of the negotiating team were bitterly disappointed by a new Israeli document tabled last Thursday on ideas for an interim self-governing authority in the West bank and Gaza Strip. They said it was little different from previous proposals, offered no real transfer of authority, and contradicted the whole basis of the peace process. The Palestinians say Israeli troops have killed at least 18 Palestinians since the peace talks reconvened last month, while the economy is suffering because workers are banned from crossing into Israel. They also claim Israel has reneged on a promise to speed the return of the Palestinians deported last December to southern Lebanon, and to improve conditions in the occupied territories. It seems unlikely that the small Israeli concession on deportees will be enough to persuade the Palestinians to return a full complement to the Middle East peace negotiations. The Palestinians had already halted work on the sub-committee dealing with human rights. Work has now also been stopped on committees on self-government and the issues of land and water.

The mood in the occupied territories and Israel itself contrasts strongly with the upbeat assessment of the peace process provided by President Bill Clinton and Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, after more than three hours of talks at the White House on Monday. A spokesman for Mr Rabin said he would be returning three days earlier than expected from the US in order to address the problem of worsening violence. The clashes yesterday between Palestinian demonstrators and Israeli troops at the Khan Younis refugee camp in Gaza were said to be the worst since the outbursts which followed the deportation of 415 Palestinians by Israel to southern Lebanon in December. Palestinian negotiators insist they will not resume peace talks until Israel makes a public commitment not to resort to mass deportations. Mr Clinton said on Monday that the deportation issue had already been dealt with and had not featured in his talks with Mr Rabin. This further angered the Palestinians and Mrs Hanan Ashrawi, the spokeswoman for the negotiating team, said it was a mistake for the US and Israel to think they could just push the issue to one side. In Gaza, doctors said that a 17-year-old boy died after being shot in the chest.

Their hands raised in the Serbian Orthodox three-fingered salute, 55 deputies of the self-styled Bosnian Serb parliament voted in favour of the constitutional principles for a future state of Bosnia-Hercegovina, with 15 against. The result was deceptive, achieved after two days of fierce debate during which most deputies attacked the international community and pledged never to forego 'holy Serbian goals'. The vote coincided with agreement by Bosnia's Moslem leaders to an immediate ceasefire after recent clashes with their nominal Croatian allies. This followed the intervention of international mediators, Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen. The co-chairmen of the Geneva peace conference on former Yugoslavia had flown to Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, yesterday for talks with President Alija Izetbegovic of Bosnia and his prime minister, Mile Akmedzic. Earlier, Mr Mate Boban, the Bosnian Croat leader, had ordered his troops to stop fighting Moslems over disputed territory. After the vote by Bosnian Serbs and the Moslem-Croat truce, it was announced that peace talks would be resumed in Geneva on Saturday. Although the Bosnian Serbs have formally accepted the constitutional framework for Bosnia-Hercegovina, providing for a unitary state divided into 10 semi-autonomous provinces, it was clear that most deputies were still deeply opposed. 'We have to choose between war and peace,' Mr Momcilo Krajisnik, the hardline speaker of the Bosnian assembly, said. 'The decision was taken under international pressure and threats of isolation.' His statement was a clear reference to the pressure to which Mr Karadzic and the deputies had been subjected by President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia, anxious to see an end to the conflict and international sanctions against Serbia. At the assembly meeting in a converted canteen, Serbian leaders assured deputies they were not renouncing the creation of a separate Bosnian Serbian republic. They emphasised that the most vital part of the Geneva peace process still lay ahead - talks on the detailed map of the provinces into which the country would be divided. Croatia and Slovenia were yesterday admitted to the International Monetary Fund, allowing them to join the World Bank and giving them access to IMF loans, writes George Graham in Washington.

At yesterday's weekly cabinet meeting, ministers from the left-wing Meretz party urged the immediate opening of face-to-face negotiations with the PLO and Mr Yassir Arafat, its leader, to try to break the deadlock in the Middle East peace process. Mr Rabin himself remains adamantly opposed to the PLO's inclusion in the peace process and he blocked a cabinet vote on the direct talks proposal. However, several ministers from Mr Rabin's own Labour party echoed the call. Mr Uzi Baram, Labour's tourism minister, said later that the 'worst error' of successive Israeli governments since the capture of the territories in 1967 had been the boycott of talks with the PLO. Earlier this year the Israeli parliament lifted a ban on meetings between Israeli citizens and the PLO. The growing support at cabinet for a direct government dialogue with the Tunis-based PLO leadership reflects Israeli concern at the rise of the radical Islamic movement Hamas in the Gaza Strip and West Bank.

They approached various aspects of bilateral relations, the  current stage of the peace negotiations on former Yugoslavia,  and aspects of their finalization. They emphasized the good  relations between Romania and Serbia and the two countries'  actions toward instilling a climate of peace and security in the  Balkans and achieving multilateral cooperation after the  peaceful settlement of the conflicts in the region.    Our correspondent reported that the talks between the two  presidents are to continue through a working lunch and in the  afternoon at Cotroceni Palace.    About 40 minutes ago, President Slobodan Milosevic laid a  wreath at the monument to the unknown hero in Carol Park, after  which he held talks with Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu.    President Milosevic's schedule also includes a meeting with  representatives of the ethnic Serbs living in Romania and a  joint news conference to be held with the Romanian president.    At 1600 Romanian Foreign Minister Teodor Melescanu is to  hold  separate talks with his Yugoslav counterpart, Vladislav  Jovanovic.     "
0,FT942-4856 ,"FT942-4856 _AN-EFHDCAA9FT 940608   FT  08 JUN 94 / Jordan and Israel in peace talks progress      By JAMES WHITTINGTON      AMMAN   Jordan and Israel achieved a breakthrough in their peace talks yesterday by agreeing to implement a number of items listed on their peace 'agenda' signed last September. After two days of talks in Washington, the two countries agreed to set up a commission on boundaries and water disputes and to carry out a number of joint infrastructure and development projects. They also decided to hold future negotiations, for the first time, in either Israel or Jordan. Earlier, Mr Jawad Anani, a senior official in the Jordanian government, said the most important obstacle to better relations was the dispute over the exact demarcation of the countries' borders. The border between Jordan and Israel,pencilled out by Winston Churchill in 1922, has never been formally recognised. 'For practical reasons, we need to decide once and for all on our borders before other agreements are possible,' he said. The establishment of a joint commission to examine the disputed border has been a key Jordanian demand. The agreement came as Jordan announced a cabinet reshuffle. The current prime minister, Mr Abdel Salam al-Majali, is expected to retain his post but officials say that new faces will be brought into other positions to 'reinvigorate' the government and the new phase in the peace process. It was not clear last night who would appear in the new cabinet. The lower house of parliament has been calling for representation of MPs at cabinet level, as in previous governments, but a former minister said that this 'was doubtful'. The Jordanian/Israeli agreement includes: the construction of a road along the coastline of the Gulf of Aqaba linking Jordan, Israel and Egypt; a decision to draft an outline of future trade and economic relations, which will be co-ordinated with the Palestinians; the convening of a special sub-committee on joint tourism ventures; and co-ordination on establishing a transboundary cultural heritage park in the Rift Valley which lies along the Jordanian/Israeli border, south of the Dead Sea. The chief Israeli negotiator, Mr Eli Rubinstein, described the agreement as 'meaningful' while Jordan's ambassador to Washington, Mr Fawez Tarawneh, said it 'far exceeded our expectations'.

0,FT931-3138 ,"FT931-3138 _AN-DCQCCAETFT 930317   FT  17 MAR 93 / Violence in Israel hits peace hopes      By ROGER MATTHEWS   ISRAELI troops shot dead two Palestinians and wounded more than 70 yesterday, as intensified violence in the occupied territories cast a deeper shadow over the prospects for a resumption of Middle East peace negotiations. The mood in the occupied territories and Israel itself contrasts strongly with the upbeat assessment of the peace process by President Bill Clinton and Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, after more than three hours of talks at the White House on Monday. A spokesman for Mr Rabin said he would return three days earlier than expected from the US to address the problem of worsening violence. The clashes yesterday between Palestinian demonstrators and Israeli troops at the Khan Younis refugee camp in Gaza were said to be the worst since the outbursts that followed deportation of 415 Palestinians by Israel to southern Lebanon in December. Palestinian negotiators insist they will not resume peace talks until Israel makes a public commitment not to resort to further mass deportations. Hospital officials said that two Palestinian youths, aged 17 and 18, were killed in the Khan Younis refugee camp. Israeli troops opened fire several times on stone-throwing Palestinians who had taken to the streets after the lifting of a curfew on the camp. The latest clashes come against deepening concern in Israel over attacks on Jewish civilians by individual Palestinians.   Countries:-  ILZ  Israel, Middle East.

But Mr Abdul-Salem al-Majali, Jordan's new prime minister, strongly denied his country was close to signing a treaty with Israel. Earlier, Mr Shimon Peres, Israel's foreign minister, had claimed the two countries had essentially reached an accord. 'We just have to take out the pen and sign,' he told Israel radio. However, Mr Majali said that what was being worked on with Israel was an agenda and the terms of reference for negotiations. 'It has substance, but it is just an agenda, not a peace agreement', he said. Radio reports that a peace treaty was ready to be signed were 'absolutely and completely untrue,' he said. A meeting of foreign ministers in Amman at the weekend had re-stated the Arab commitment to the peace process but, at Palestinian insistence, stopped short of formally accepting the joint US-Russian invitation to resume in Washington on June 15. The Palestinians are looking for firmer assurances that the US will become more directly involved in the negotiations, and that Israel will take more measures to ease conditions in the occupied territories. Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, was due in Amman last night for talks on these issues with King Hussein of Jordan.   Countries:-  XNZ  Middle East.

The Joint Declaration was framed as a balanced set of  principles, fairly addressing the concerns and aspirations of  both traditions in Northern Ireland. It demonstrated that, in  their approach to Northern Ireland's future, the governments of  the United Kingdom and of the Republic of Ireland stand on  common ground.    The Declaration underlined the principle that the future of  Northern Ireland must be founded on consent. If offered the  people of Ireland, North and South respectively, the basis to  agree that their differences could be negotiated and resolved  exclusively by peaceful political means.    The Declaration looked to the full participation in politics  of ""democratically mandated parties which established a  commitment to exclusively peaceful methods and which have shown  that they abide by the democratic process"".    To join the political dialogue with the two governments,  parties were not required to accept the Joint Declaration. They  were required only to declare and demonstrate a permanent end to  violence, and to abide by the democratic process.    Since its adoption, the Joint Declaration has attracted very  wide support thoughout Ireland and far beyond. More than ever,  the people of Northern Ireland want to live in peace and to  resolve their problems democratically and by negotiation.    Yet paramilitary and sectarian violence continues. They see  no justification for this. The Joint Declaration shows that  there is none. It is against this background that we are today  publishing the questions from Sinn Fein, passed to us by the  Irish Government, within this statement.    We have always sought to ensure that our position on the  Joint Declaration is clearly understood by all. As both  Governments have repeatedly emphasised, the terms of the  Declaration are not open to negotiation. Nor will we enter into  questions about future arrangements in Ireland which can  properly be decided only through negotiations involving  democratic parties dedicated exclusively to peaceful political  means.    Both Governments are anxious to see such negotiations take  place on a comprehensive basis, as set out in the Declaration.    Our comments on this document are as follows.    As will readily be seen, the questions which have been  passed  to us range much more widely than seeking elucidation of the  text of the Joint Declaration, though some can be dealt with by  reference to it.    The questions can be considered under these headings:    (i) Questions involving an explanation of the text of the  Joint Declaration; (ii) Questions which appear to seek to  reopen the negotiations which led to the Joint Declaration;    (iii) Questions concerning the British Government's policy  in  respect of Northern Ireland which, far from arising from any  uncertainty about the text of the Joint Declaration, are  answered by reference to it.    (iv) Questions not arising directly from the text of the  Joint Declaration but concerning procedures consequent on a  cessation of violence, including questions about the agenda for  subsequent substantive political dialogue.    (v) Questions not arising from any obscurity in the text of  the Joint Declaration but raising substantive questions of wider  Government policy, or questions which would arise in a process  of substantive political dialogue following a cessation of  violence.    (vi) Questions repeating earlier questions or essentially  covering the same ground.    These headings are dealt with in turn. There were 20  questions in the (Sinn Fein) paper passed (to us) by the Irish  Government, and the question numbers which follow are those from  that paper.    I. Questions Involving an Explanation of the Text of the  Joint Declaration.    Q. 4 The British Government says, in the Downing Street  Declaration, ""that they will uphold the democratic wishes of a  great number of the people of Northern Ireland."" What is the  British Government's precise definition of ""a greater number of  the people of Northern Ireland"" and how would this be measured  in practical terms?    Comment    The wish of a greater number of the people of Northern  Ireland would be determined by a numerical majority of those  validly voting in a poll fairly and explicitly organised for  this purpose. Provision for such a poll is made in section 1 of  the Northern Ireland Constitution Act: 1973.    II. Questions which appear to seek to reopen the  negotiations which led to the Joint Declaration.    Q.2 Given that the document put to you in June 1993 was  welcomed by the IRA leadership which commented, on October 3,  1993, that it ""could form the basis for peace"", could you  clarify the differences, if any, between this document and the  Downing Street Declaration?    Comment    This question, referring to a document put to us by the  Irish  Government, does not arise from any uncertainty about the text  of the Joint Declaration which was the product of detailed and  extensive discussions between the two Governments.    These discussions were largely directed towards ensuring  that  the Declaration was clear and unambiguous in its treatment of  the key principles to which both Governments are committed --  including consent, agreement, and parity of esteem and equity of  treatment for both parts of the community in Northern Ireland.    Therefore the only text that bears our name and on which we  can comment is that which was issued on 15 December, 1993, by  the Prime Minister and the Taoiseach [Irish Prime Minister  Albert Reynolds] .    III. Questions concerning the British Government's policy  in respect of Northern Ireland which, far from arising from any  uncertainty about the text of the Joint Declaration are answered  by reference to it.    Q.1 The long-term political objectives of the two  Governments are of crucial importance if we are to move out of  the conflict situation caused by the present failed political  structures.    The Taoiseach has clearly stated the long-term objectives of  the Irish Government in the search for a lasting settlement. It  is essential that the British Government displays the same  honesty and frankness in outlining its long-term attitude  towards the Irish people.    What are the British Government's long-term interests and  objectives in relation to Ireland?    Comment    Paragraph 4 of the Joint Declaration already spells out the  British Government's objectives and interests in relation to  Ireland -- in terms which speak for themselves. In particular,  it states that the British Government's ""primary interest is to  see peace, stability and reconciliation established by agreement  among all the people who inhabit the island, and they will work  together with the Irish Government to achieve such an agreement,  which will embrace the totality of relationships.""    Q.3 The British and Irish Governments have said that the  political structures cannot be predetermined, now or in the  future. How do you reconcile this with your adherence to the  partition of Ireland and the maintenance of the union?    Paragraph 4 of the Joint Declaration makes it clear that the  British Government ""will uphold the democratic wish of a greater  number of the people of Northern Ireland on the issue of whether  they prefer to support the Union or a sovereign united Ireland.""    Further, the Government reaffirm as a binding obligation  that  they will introduce the necessary legislation to give effect to  any measure of agreement on future relationships in Ireland  which the people living there, North and South, may themselves  freely determine without external impediment. These statements  confirm that in political dialogue no outcome is either  predetermined or ruled out.    In relation to partition, both Governments are guided by the  reality of the present situation and the principle of consent.  This is reflected in Article 1 of the Anglo-Irish Agreement,  and in paragraph 7 of the Declaration:    ""Both Governments accept that Irish unity would be achieved  only by those who favour this outcome persuading those who do  not, peacefully and without coercion or violence, and that, if  in the future a majority of the people of Northern Ireland are  so persuaded, both Governments will support and give legislative  effect to their wish.""    Q.7 Given the British Government's statement in the Downing  Street Declaration that it is for the Irish people to exercise  our right to self-determination, what is the basis for the  British Government's qualification of this right in Paragraph 4  of the Downing Street Declaration?    Comment    The British Government's position on self-determination in  paragraph 4 of the Joint Declaration -- that it is to be  exercised ""on the basis of consent, freely and concurrently  given, North and South..."" -- is entirely consistent with that  of the Irish Government set out in Paragraph 5 of the Joint  Declaration in which the Taoiseach: ""accepts, on behalf of the  Irish Government, that the democratic right of  self-determination by the people of Ireland as a whole must be  achieved and exercised with and subject to the agreement and  consent of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland and  must, consistent with justice and equity, respect the democratic  dignity and civil rights and religious liberties of both  communities.""    IV. Questions not arising directly from the text of the  Joint Declaration, but concerning procedures consequent on a  cessation of violence, including questions about the agenda for  subsequent substantive political dialogue.    Q.8 In the Downing Street Declaration the British Government  gives a commitment to allow the Irish people to freely determine  our future without external impediment or interference, to  encourage, facilitate and enable agreement on this basis and to  introduce the necessary legislation to give effect to this  agreement. Does this mean that the Government of Ireland Act,  Section 75 of which states ""the supreme authority of the  parliament of the United Kingdom shall remain unaffected and  undiminished over all persons, and things in (Northern) Ireland  and every part thereof,"" would be needed as part of an overall  agreement?    Comment    The content of an overall agreement will depend on the  outcome of negotiations within the talks process. The British  Government have confirmed that they wil introduce the necessary  legislation to give effect to any measures of the agreement in  future relationships which the people of Ireland may freely  determine on the basis set out in paragraph 4 of the Joint  Declaration. The implications for the Government of Ireland Act  would depend on the nature and content of any such agreement.    Q.11 Given the commitment by the two governments that  everything will be on the table for negotiation:    (a) Will the union between Ireland and Britain be on the  agenda for negotiation?    (b) Will the Government of Ireland Act be on the agenda for  negotiation?    Comment    The 26 March 1991 statement, outlining the basis for the  three stranded talks, said that ""in order to ensure a full  airing of the issues, it will be open to each of the parties to  raise any aspect of these relationships, including  constitutional issues, or any other matter which it considers  relevant"". No political objective could properly be excluded  from discussion in the talks process.    Q.13 Does the British Government accept that while the  consent of a majority of the people of the six county state to  constitutional change, as referred to in the Downing Street  Declaration, may be desirable it is not a legal requirement in  international law?    Comment    Both Governments make clear in the Joint Declaration that  any  change in the constitutional status of Northern Ireland would be  subject to the consent of a majority of its people as set out in  the Anglo-Irish Agreement, itself an international instrument  registered at the United Nations.    Q.14 Given the commitment in the Downing Street Declaration  to work towards a balanced constitutional accommodation does the  British Government accept that the present structures and  arrangements do not represent a balanced constitutional  accommodation? [no comment on Q.14 as received]    Q.15 Given the commitment in the Downing Street Declaration  to work towards a balanced constitutional accommodation, what  constitutional options does the British Government see as being  consistent with this objective?    Comment    In paragraph 1 of the Joint Declaration both Governments  recognise an ""absence of a lasting and satisfactory settlement  of relationships between the peoples of both islands..."".  Constitutional issues are among those eligible to be addressed  in the talks process.    Q.17 The Taoiseach has said that political parties need not  accept every phrase or word in the Downing Street Declaration.  In fact the DUP [Democratic Unionist Party] have rejected the  Declaration in total and the UUP [Ulster Unionist Party] have  said that it has run its course.    (a) Does the rejection of the Declaration by a political  party exclude that party from involvement in talks on the  development of new political arrangements?    (b) Do parties which are opposed to aspects of the Downing  Street Declaration have the right to dissent from it and yet be  engaged in talks on the development of new political  arrangements?    Comment    The Declaration is an agreed position between the two  Governments. It does not depend for its validity on the  attitude of other parties, who are free to determine their own  views on it, and to represent those views in future negotiations.    Acceptance of the Joint Declaration is not a precondition  for  entering the talks process. What IS required is a permanent end  to the use of, or support for, paramilitary violence. The two  Governments say in the Joint Declaration that ""...in these  circumstances, democratically mandated parties which establish a  commitment to exclusively peaceful methods and which have shown  that they abide by the democratic process, are free to  participate fully in democratic politics and to join in dialogue  in due course between the Governments and the political parties  on the way ahead.""    Q.18 Exploratory Dialogue    Sinn Fein, as a matter of policy, advocates inclusive  dialogue without preconditions. We do not accept the imposition  of preconditions on our party or on any other party. However,  in the interests of clarity we wish to explore the British  Government position on these matters as outlined in the Downing  Street Declaration.    (a) The British Government has called upon Sinn Fein to  renounce violence. What does this involve?    (b) Patrick Mayhew is reported as saying that a permanent  cessation of violence ""is the way in which full recognition can  be accorded to the mandate which Sinn Fein candidates are  accorded at the polls"" (Irish Times, Thursday, 14/4/94). How  does the British Government reconcile its refusal to recognise  our democratic mandate with its stated commitment to democratic  principles?    (c) The British Prime Minister has referred to a period of  decontamination for Sinn Fein. What does this mean?    (d) What would be the purpose of the exploratory dialogue  between Sinn Fein and the British Government?    (e) How long would this exploratory dialogue last?    (f) Within this process, when would negotiations about the  future constitutional and political shape of Ireland take place?    Comment    The position of both Governments is set out clearly in  Paragraph 10 of the Joint Declaration. There has to be a  permanent end to the use of, or support for, paramilitary  violence. In these circumstances ""democratically mandated  parties which establish a commitment to exclusively peaceful  methods and which have shown that they abide by the democratic  process, are free to participate fully in democratic politics  and to join in dialogue in due course between the Governments  and the political parties on the way ahead.""    For Sinn Fein and the IRA this would involve a public and  permanent renunciation of violence as a means of achieving  political ends, and commitment to peaceful and democratic means  alone.    Within three months, as has already been publicly made  clear, the British Government would in these circumstances begin  exploratory dialogue with Sinn Fein. The purposes of such  dialogue would be:    (i) to explore the basis upon which Sinn Fein would come to  be admitted to an inclusive political talks process to which the  British Government is committed but without anticipating the  negotiations within that process;    (ii) to exchange views on how Sinn Fein would be able over a  period to play the same part as the current constitutional  parties in the public life of Northern Ireland;    (iii) to examine the practical consequences of the ending of  violence.    The reason for the time lapse between a permanent cessation  of violence and exploratory dialogue is to enable the commitment  to exclusively peaceful and democractic methods to be fully  demonstrated.    The British Government accept the validity of all electoral  mandates, including that of Sinn Fein; and, being committed to  the democratic process, endorses the freedom of voters to choose  their elected representatives. There is no inconsistency  between this and requiring that all who join in political  dialogue should demonstrate a commitment to exclusively peaceful  methods and to the democratic process. Democracy and violence  cannot be reconciled.    Q.20 The Downing Street Declaration is described as ""the  starting point of a peace process designed to culminate in a  political settlement."" What are the subsequent steps which the  British Government envisages as part of a process of dialogue,  reconciliation and demilitarisation leading to peace and a  political settlement?    Comment    Paragraphs 10 and 11 of the Joint Declaration and associated  statements (see comment on Question 18 above) spell out what  will happen when there is a permanent cessation of violence.  The exploratory dialogue leading to Sinn Fein's involvement in  the political talks process would then begin. A lasting and  general peace would render military operations in support of the  police no longer necessary.    If the Joint Declaration is ""the starting point of a peace  process,"" the next step is for the violence to end for good.    V. Questions not arising from any obscurity in the text of  the Joint Declaration, but raising substantive questions of  wider Government policy, or questions which would arise in a  process of substantive political dialogue following a cessation  of violence.    Q.5 The British Government has said that it has ""no selfish  strategic or economic interest in Northern Ireland."" Would it  not be more in accord with democratic principles for the British  Government to base its Irish policy on the objective of ending  the union?    Comment    The Joint Declaration makes it clear that the British  Government is committed to upholding the principle of consent.    Q.6 The British Government has said that its primary  interest is to see agreement reached between all the Irish  people.    (a) Given the continued intransigent attitude of the  Unionist  leadership, how, in real terms, is such an agreement to be  reached, particularly if the unionist leadership refuses to  engage in the search for agreement?    (b) What is the framework which the British Government  intends to create for the achievement of agreement. [no graf (c)  as received]    (d) Does the British Government accept that, given the  weight  of nationalist opinion throughout Ireland in opposition to  partition, that substantial movement on constitutional issues by  the British Government and the Unionist Parties will be required  if democratic agreement is to be reached?    e) How is agreement to be measured in practical terms and at  what stage does the withholding or absence of agreement on the  part of one section of the Irish people become a veto over  change?    Comment    In Paragraph 4 of the Joint Declaration, the British  Government commits itself to working together with the Irish  Government to achieve peace, stability and reconciliation  established by agreement among all the people who inhabit the  island and to ""encourage, facilitate and enable the achievement  of such agreement..."". No organisation has a veto over that  process, whether by withdrawing from it or by refusing to  renounce violence. The two Governments will continue to seek  agreement between themselves and the main constitutional parties  in Northern Ireland on the basis of the agreed statement of 26  March 1991 -- focusing on the three main relationships which are  those within Northern Ireland, among the people of the island of  Ireland and between the two Governments. A keynote of the Joint  Declaration is that any new arrangements must be founded on  consent. It would be wrong to attempt to anticipate the outcome  of the discussions or to set an artificial time limit on the  achievement of agreement on issues of fundamental importance to  the people of these islands. Other issues raised in this  question are properly the concern of participants in the process  of political dialogue.    Q.16 The Taoiseach has said that Unionists possess a veto  only in regard to whether to belong to a sovereign United  Ireland or the UK, that they do not possess a veto over the  policy of the two governments or over interim measures which may  be adopted. Is this also the position for the British  Government?    Comment    No group or organisation has a veto over the policy of a  democratically elected Government. The policy of both  Governments, set out in the Joint Declaration, is however,  founded firmly on the principles of democracy, agreement and  consent.    Q.19 (a) Given the declared opposition of both Governments  to coercion, how will the coercion of Northern nationalists  into the six county state be addressed in real terms?    (b) How will the denial of nationalist rights be redressed  in real terms?    (c) When will repressive legislation be ended?    Comment    This question is based on assumptions which have no  foundation in reality. The Government's approach is reflected  by paragraph 4 of the Joint Declaration which includes the  statement that:    ""The role of the British Government will be to encourage,  facilitate and enable the achievement of... agreement over a  period through a process of dialogue and co-operation based on  full respect for the rights and identities of both traditions in  Ireland.""    It is the clearly declared aim of both Governments that ALL  new arrangements agreed in the course of political dialogue  should be based on consent. An end to violence would open the  way for a comprehensive reassessment of existing provisions  against terrorism, many of which would become irrelevant and  obsolete in a climate of peace.    VI. Questions repeating earlier questions or essentially  covering the same ground.    Q.9 How does the British Government reconcile its stated  objective of maintaining the union with its declared lack of  strategic or economic interest in Ireland?    Q.10 Given the British Government's declared lack of  ""selfish  strategic or economic interest in Northern Ireland,"" what is the  British Government's political interest in ""Northern Ireland""?    Comment    These points are covered in comment on questions 1 and 8.    Q.12 Given the statement by the British Government in the  Downing Street Declaration that ""it is for the people of the  island of Ireland alone, by agreement between the two parts  respectively, to exercise their right of self-determination on  the basis of consent,""    (a) Is the continued operation of the Government of Ireland  Act subject to agreement on this basis?    (b) Is the continued existence of the union subject to  agreement on this basis?    Comment    There is nothing to add to the comments given above.  Paragraph 4 of the Joint Declaration could not spell out more  clearly the position in relation to the Union.    The Question for Sinn Fein    Sinn Fein have asked their questions. But the most  fundamental question being asked by the people of these islands  is for them to answer. Democracy and violence cannot be  reconciled. Sinn Fein must choose. They know what they have to  do if they are effectively to fulfil their democratic mandate.  The democratic path leads to a meaningful role in the political  process: a process in which, as has been explained, all issues  are open for discussion and negotiation. The alternative is  isolation -- standing on the outside while those committed to  democracy shape the agreement, structures and institutions that  will determine the relationships between the peoples of these  islands.    Sinn Fein claim a commitment to the principle of self-  determination. That means abiding by the will of the people.  The vast majority of people in Ireland, North and South and of  both traditions, demand an end to violence now. Their wishes  could not be clearer. There is no conceivable justification for  continuing to rob people of their lives, least of all a call for  a textual explanation of the Joint Declaration.    Sinn Fein ask what comes next. Certainly no further playing  for time. If the Joint Declaration is ""the starting point of a  peace process"", the next step is for violence to end for good.     "
0,FT921-13984 ,"FT921-13984 _AN-CASAAAALFT 920118   FT  18 JAN 92 / Shamir warns peace talks may be slowed      By HUGH CARNEGY      JERUSALEM   MR Yitzhak Shamir, the Israeli prime minister, pledged yesterday to continue Middle East peace talks despite the imminent collapse of his coalition government. But he warned that progress in the negotiations might be hampered during the expected prolonged election campaign. Two extreme right-wing parties, Tehiya and Moledet, will tomorrow formally resign from the coalition, led by Mr Shamir's Likud party, in protest against the peace talks. Their departure will leave the government without a parliamentary majority. Mr Shamir has indicated he will seek a general election in May or June. Mr Hans Van Der Broek, the Dutch foreign minister who is visiting Israel, yesterday expressed to Mr Shamir what he called the world's concern that the election should not be used to delay the peace process launched at the Madrid Middle East Peace Conference last October. He said Mr Shamir had assured him this would not be the case. 'The peace process will continue. For our part, we will try to proceed with it as much as we can,' the prime minister said in a newspaper interview. But he added: 'It is possible there will be certain restrictions because of the special situation we are in.' Mr Shamir, a sceptical participant from the start, will not mind if the already tortuous negotiations slow because of the election. But the Likud has made plain it intends to use its commitment to the peace process as a central part of its election platform. The stance is rich in irony, given the role Mr Shamir and his party have in the past played in torpedoing peace initiatives, but it will pose a problem for the opposition Labour party, which traditionally campaigns as the party of peace. There was no conirmation yesterday of reports that a hostage swap involving Israel was imminent.  The Financial Times   London Page 3  "

This interim formula emerged after a meeting between EC foreign ministers and Mr James Baker on the eve of the US secretary of state's third peace mission to the region. It did not meet the EC's request to be more directly involved but, diplomats said it reflected a state of play where it was still not clear whether Washington could get talks started at all. Prior to the meeting, senior European diplomats insisted that the EC would accept only full 'co-sponsorship' of peace talks, along with the US and the Soviet Union. Israel, which has accepted in principle the US plan for face-to-face talks with the Arabs, objects to close European involvement because of the EC's long-standing call for a UN-sponsored peace conference which would include the Palestinians. Mr Baker said after the meeting that his primary objective was 'to establish a process that has some reasonable chance of success and of being begun in the first place'. But he added that 'we have made it very clear to Israel that Europe can contribute to this process and should be involved.' The EC's usefulness is in part because it has favoured the 'international' peace conference sought by Syria and the Palestinian Liberation Organisation. Such a UN-backed conference would have at the top of its agenda Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, the 'land-for-peace' formula requiring Israel to withdraw from the occupied territories in exchange for a settlement.

The Palestine Liberation Organisation said in Tunis that Palestinians would suspend taking part in the peace talks until the deportees were allowed to return. In an unprecedented mass expulsion, the Israelis drove most of the deportees across the border in convoys of buses, while 32 were flown out in a helicopter. The expulsion follows the kidnapping and killing of an Israeli border policeman earlier this week. Opponents went to court to try to stop the expulsions, but the deportees - accused of belonging to militant Islamic groups - were taken over the border as soon as Israel's High Court approved their deportation. Last night they were still trapped in snow-covered terrain in the Israeli-controlled security zone of southern Lebanon after Lebanese troops had drawn up with orders to stop them going deeper into Lebanon. Outraged Palestinian leaders and the Syrians boycotted the last day of their current round of talks with Israel in Washington in protest at the expulsions. But President George Bush, seeking to keep the US-backed peace process alive, hosted separate meetings at the White House with teams representing Israel and its adversaries, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and the Palestinians. The US State Department condemned the deportations and said it had urged Israel not to go ahead with them. In Little Rock, Arkansas, President-elect Bill Clinton said he was concerned the expulsions 'may go too far and imperil the peace talks'. Mr Bush said: 'I am confident the new administration is going to want to see the peace talks continue. It has got to go forward.' But Mrs Hanan Ashrawi, the Palestinian spokeswoman, said: 'The peace process. . . is on the brink of disaster.' Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, ordered the expulsions in retaliation for violent attacks on Israeli forces by the Hamas Islamic fundamentalist movement, culminating on Tuesday in the murder of the kidnapped paramilitary border police officer. It is by far the largest peacetime expulsion by Israel since it captured the West Bank and Gaza Strip in 1967. The deportees were kept tied and blindfolded for almost 20 hours in 22 buses at the Lebanese border while civil rights lawyers tried in vain to win a court order halting the action. The Israeli government said the deported Palestinians could appeal against the decision once they were in exile and could return home after not more than two years. Mr Rabin brushed aside protests, saying the expulsions were necessary to crack down on Hamas. 'We said we would wage a war against terrorism as if there were no peace negotiations and engage in peace negotiations as if there was no war against terrorism.' Saying the alternatives were to introduce the death penalty, destroy Palestinian homes or allow soldiers greater freedom to open fire in the occupied territories, Mr Rabin added: 'We chose the way which involves the least violation of human life and property.' Palestinians said the expulsions went beyond the harsh policies of the previous government led by the Likud party and undermined the credibility of Mr Rabin's commitment to peace talks. The decision 'shows that the Labour government is capable of taking more repressive measures than the Likud,' said Mr Sari Nusseibeh, an adviser to the Palestinian delegation. The decision was supported by ministers from Labour's left-liberal Meretz coalition partners who had strongly opposed the 66 previous deportations carried out during the five years of the Palestinian uprising, or intifada, in the occupied territories.

Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, said last week that Israel now recognised Syrian sovereignty over the strategic Heights, which the Jewish state seized in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. 'The government of Israel has recognised Syrian sovereignty over the Golan Heights and the concept of peace based on international borders subject to the security needs of Israel,' Mr Peres said. He also referred in a foreign ministry communique to a 1967 secret cabinet resolution calling for negotiations with Syria on the basis of withdrawal to the 'international border' in return for full peace, demilitarisation of the Golan and guarantees of the flow of water to the Jordan Valley. The foreign minister also spoke of the strong precedent of the 1979 peace treaty with Egypt which had seen the return of all Egyptian territory occupied by Israel. Foreign ministry officials said the formal recognition of Syrian sovereignty effectively relegated Israel's annexation of the Heights in 1981 and that Mr Peres' 'far-reaching' remarks were the broadest hint so far that Israel would yield all the Heights up to the 1967 international border in return for full peace and security guarantees. The Israeli-Syrian peace talks have been deadlocked as Israel refused to specify how much of the Heights it would return to Damascus until Syrian President Hafez al Assad made a commitment to full peace including open borders, trade, tourism and the establishment of embassies. However, despite Mr Peres' apparent hints, Israel has still not met Syrian demands that Jerusalem formally declare it will withdraw to 1967 borders and return the entire Golan. Syria said Mr Peres' statements added nothing new, as Israel's recognition of Syrian sovereignty over the Heights was 'a recognition of fact' in accordance with United Nations resolutions.

Mr John Mills, spokesman for the peace talks, said the mediators 'hoped to be in a position' to reconvene talks among the three warring communities in the week beginning December 20. However, Commission officials said President Slobodan Milosevic was using the European Union plan, which Lord Owen is promoting as the basis for a settlement, to press for a division of Sarajevo. The plan links a progressive lifting of sanctions against Serbia with some territorial gains for the Moslems. Mr Hans Van den Broek, EU external political affairs commissioner, yesterday warned that Serb territorial claims on Sarjevo risked creating 'a second Berlin or Beirut' in Europe. The EU must not be party to the division of Sarajevo in the Geneva peace talks, he said. It was a matter of principle, since Sarejevo remained an example of a multi-ethnic city in Bosnia. The peace negotiators faced a difficult dilemma in their effort to reach a settlement, and the EU could not object to an agreement signed by all the parties. But he noted that the Bosnian Moslems were negotiating 'with a gun to their head'. His remarks came after a series of bilateral talks which failed to break the deadlock over proposed frontiers of the republic's partition into three ethnic ministates. 'The Serbs apparently did not give enough for the Moslems to be happy enough for them to meet,' said a diplomat. Earlier, diplomats had said that if the talks with Mr Milosevic and his Bosnian Serb proxies went well, the three parties would meet this weekend in Thessaloniki, Greece. However, at yesterday's talks, which Serbian sources said were held at Dobanovci, a military base 30km west of Belgrade, the mediators apparently failed to wring concessions from Serb leaders for their Moslem adversaries. While the mediators press Serb leaders to hand over more land, General Ratko Mladic, Bosnian Serb commander, has ruled out giving up any territory, including the 20 per cent pledged three months ago. But Mr Radovan Karadzic, Bosnian Serb leader, was reported by a Belgrade newspaper yesterday as saying: 'There are real possibilities that the war in former Bosnia-Hercegovina will end in January or February next year, and the lifting of sanctions against Yugoslavia will follow.'

The extremist Islamic Hamas movement said it carried out the attack in revenge for the massacre of Palestinians in Hebron in February. Witnesses said children fled the explosion 'burning like torches' when the 385lb bomb exploded at midday at a central bus stop in the relatively peaceful northern town of Afula. The attack, one of the bloodiest yet seen inside Israel itself, prompted the government to seal off the occupied territories preventing Palestinian cars crossing into the Jewish state. The bomb blast coincided with talks in Cairo between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation on implementing their peace deal. However, Mr Yossi Sarid, environment minister, said the peace talks would continue. Otherwise 'we are placing ourselves in the hands of these suicide bombers - and that is their wish'. The bombing by Hamas, which had vowed to avenge the lives of 29 Palestinians massacred by a Jewish settler in Hebron, will fuel growing Israeli right-wing opposition to the peace process. As promised, Hamas struck 40 days after the February 25 Hebron massacre  - the mourning period which, in Islam, must be observed before revenge can be taken. The Islamic movement warned Israel that suicide operations would increase. Shlomi Dahn, an 18-year-old schoolboy who ran to the scene after the blast, said screaming people whose clothes were on fire were trying to escape from the bus. 'It was like a battlefield,' he said. 'Bodies and parts of bodies were everywhere and there was blood, noise, smoke - everything like war.' Mr David Harbi, keeper of a music store who rushed to the scene, had burns on his hands where he had tried to douse flames on the victims' clothes. 'It was like the worst nightmare of the Jews,' he said - 'the feeling that if the Arabs have the chance they will drive us into the sea or kill us all'. In the aftermath Arabs in the town were randomly beaten. Israeli teenagers gathered at the charred bus stop to denounce the peace process and the government of Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the prime minister. They chanted 'Kill the Arabs', and sang songs praising Dr Baruch Goldstein, the Jewish settler who was responsible for the massacre at Hebron. Mr Harbi said: 'The absurd thing was that in one of the school bags I saw Arabic language books. The child was trying to learn Arabic to prepare for the peace. Can you imagine that? If this is the price we have to pay for peace, we don't want it anymore.' Mark Nicholson adds from Cairo: Mr Nabil Shaath, who has led the Palestinian delegation in talks with Israel on self-rule for Gaza-Jericho, said such incidents were 'one of the reasons we are pushing for the signing of this agreement - to stop the killing on both sides.' The attack showed the urgent need to complete as soon as possible the details of an Israeli withdrawal, he said. Editorial Comment, Page 17   Countries:-  ILZ  Israel, Middle East.

Mr Ron Brown, the US commerce secretary, is expected to address the conference, which is aimed at boosting the number of foreign companies investing in the province as part of the process of reviving its economy in the wake of IRA and Loyalist ceasefires. Tackling Northern Ireland's endemic high unemployment is seen as an important part of the peace process. The province's unemployment rate - 12.7 per cent - remains about 3 percentage points higher than the national average. Unemployment is particularly high among males in city centres such as Belfast and Derry. The Industrial Development Board for Northern Ireland says the province has enjoyed one of its best years for foreign investment. In the 12 months to March 1994 new investment totalled Pounds 505m, of which Pounds 260m was new foreign inward investment. The inward investment created 2,300 new jobs net. The investment figure for this year should be higher because of the controversial Hualon project from Taiwan. The IDB believes that the province's violent image has deterred potential investors. The conference will be told that a peaceful Northern Ireland holds considerable attractions for foreign investors - with a highly skilled workforce based on engineering industries and wage levels 16 per cent lower than those in mainland Britain. The IDB says land and property is considerably cheaper than in Great Britain. It is able to offer a package of incentives which can include 50 per cent of start-up costs. Mr John Hume, leader of the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party, is expected to receive a rapturous reception from the 600 delegates to the party's 24th annual conference over the weekend. His keynote speech is expected to cover the future of the peace process in the next 12 months.

The fighting persisted several hours after the deadline of 6pm set for the truce between the three main ethnic groups of Moslems, Serbs and Croats. It came as Mr Milan Panic, the new prime minister of Yugoslavia  - comprising Serbia and Montenegro - made a hastily arranged visit to Sarajevo. Bosnian radio, which also reported renewed clashes around Tuzla and Jajce, north of Sarajevo, said the mortar attacks had pinned down Mr Panic at the United Nations headquarters after talks with Mr Alija Izetbegovic, the president of Bosnia-Hercegovina. Mr Panic offered to start immediate peace talks with Bosnian leaders to end the four-month war in Bosnia. After almost three hours of talks with Mr Izetbegovic, he said the Yugoslav and Serb side was ready to end 'this stupid, unbelievable, unconscionable war'. He said he had given Mr Izetbegovic 'a very short time to reply' and that, if he did not agree, the world would know which side wanted to continue the war. Mr Panic's peace mission follows the imposition on May 31 of tough UN sanctions on Yugoslavia in retaliation for backing Serb militia in Bosnia. Fighting between Serbs and mostly Moslem forces loyal to the Bosnian government yesterday continued in Gorazde, eastern Bosnia. Radio Sarajevo said civilians and Bosnian forces had suffered heavy casualties. Around 70,000 people are reported to have been trapped in Gorazde, which for three months has been surrounded by Serb militia and entirely cut off from the outside world. Gorazde is the region's last Moslem stronghold. The EC-sponsored ceasefire was intended to last at least 14 days, allowing time for all three sides to hand over heavy artillery to UN peacekeepers. It also calls for some 1.2m refugees to be allowed to return home. Mr Panic said his peace mission had the backing of Mr Radovan Karadzic, the militant leader of Bosnia's Serbs. The 62-year-old California millionaire who has US-Yugoslav dual nationality was due to travel to New York yesterday to meet Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary general. During a visit at the weekend to Belgrade, the Serbian capital, Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, called the ceasefire agreement 'a testing point'.  The Financial Times   London Page 1  "

However, a four-hour meeting of the Nato Council in Brussels stopped short of ordering the strikes. The organisation insisted further UN consultation and Nato meetings were needed before action could be taken. It said any air strikes would be limited to supporting humanitarian relief efforts and should not be interpreted as a decision to intervene militarily in the Bosnian conflict. In a concession to the concerns of some European countries, it was agreed the UN secretary-general, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, would decide when the first air strike would take place. Mr Worner said Nato would take four criteria into account in assessing whether Serbs had lifted the siege - the blockade of water and electricity in Sarajevo, the shelling of the city, the 'strangulation' of other safe havens and attacks on UN forces. These would be monitored daily, he added. In Geneva President Alija Izetbegovic of Bosnia met the peace conference's co-chairmen in the wake of their suspension last week of peace talks amid Bosnian protests over Serb seizure of Mounts Bjelasnica and Igman, key mountains near Sarajevo. Later Mr Izetbegovic said he had refused to resume talks with his Serb and Croat adversaries until Serb forces withdrew from these mountains. The Moslem president made clear he had not met Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, during the talks. 'It was only talks with the co-chairmen. . . because we established that the Serbs did not withdraw from Mount Bjelasnica.' He said he would return to the negotiating table today but would not restart direct talks on future borders of three ethnic republics until Serb forces completed their pull-out, as promised, from the strategic high ground around Sarajevo. After the meeting, Mr Karadzic criticised international calls for military intervention against Serb targets. 'The western troops are jeopardising the conference. It gives the Moslem side a chance to stall the talks by waiting for western attacks against our positions.' Diplomats say Mr Izetbegovic is holding out for Nato air strikes against Serb targets. But some believe a firm decision on the strikes would be untimely at the moment. They cite uncertainty over whether Serb troops have withdrawn from mounts Bjelasnica and Igman. A spokesman for the peace talks said the Serb flag was no longer waving over Bjelasnica. UN officials, however, could not confirm that Serb forces had pulled back from Mount Igman, which is of greater strategic significance for the Bosnian army because it controls a crucial supply route to the besieged capital. After the talks in Brussels, US officials said they would meet Mr Izetbegovic today to dissuade him from assuming that the threat of air strikes would provide salvation for Bosnian Moslems.

The move is an attempt to assuage anger among the other Arab participants to the Middle East peace talks at having been bypassed in secret negotiations which led to the PLO-Israeli accord. Mr Hakam Balawi, a close aide of Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO chairman, said in Tunis: 'We are making efforts for the agreements to be signed at the same time.' PLO and Israeli officials have said they hoped to sign a joint declaration of principles - governing Palestinian self-rule and providing for Israeli military withdrawal from Gaza and the West Bank town of Jericho  -in Washington as early as next week. The PLO's call came after King Hussein, the Jordanian ruler, called for an Arab summit to discuss the imminent PLO-Israeli deal and co-ordinate an Arab response. In a television interview broadcast in Jordan last night, the king expressed deep disappointment at having not been consulted before the PLO-Israel deal, and said: 'We in Jordan do not accept the imposition of any agreement . . . we are not a party to.' Jordan is particularly worried about potential security implications of the deal, fearing that any violent opposition to it could spark an influx of Palestinians from the West Bank. 'If things deteriorate among the various Palestinian groups over what to do with Gaza-Jericho, then people will seek refuge in Jordan, which we cannot accept,' a senior official said in Amman. There was no immediate response to the king's call for a summit yesterday, which follows his departure for urgent talks in Damascus on hearing of the PLO-Israeli breakthrough. But diplomats said Lebanon and Syria share the king's anger at being bypassed in the PLO-Israeli talks and that all three states will want to digest both the details of the accord and the extent of Palestinian opposition to it before taking any further steps in the resumed Washington peace talks. Mr Fares Bouez, Lebanon's foreign minister, held talks in Damascus with Mr Farouk al-Sharaa, his Syrian counterpart, after which he said they had agreed 'on the importance of continued, deepened and higher co-ordination'. Syrian officials refused to comment on either the PLO-Israeli deal or King Hussein's call for a meeting. But while diplomats said Lebanon, Jordan and Syria were likely to try to forge a united front on the agreement, most believed the trio would have little choice but to join the strong momentum Israel and the PLO have created behind their accord. Jordan and Syria are close to agreeing on texts for declarations of principle to guide their own negotiations with Israel. Jordanian officials said this week they could foresee signing a joint 'agenda' with Israel during the present session of the Washington talks. Syrian negotiators in Washington said they hoped they could reach preliminary agreement with Israel next week. Meanwhile, in a sign of the potential for violence in the occupied territories, Palestinian gunmen yesterday shot dead an Israeli soldier and slightly wounded another in the West Bank town of Hebron. Israeli officials blamed the attack on fundamentalist Islamic militants who have branded the peace agreement as a betrayal of the Palestinian struggle.

The three Arab delegations, which had been due to resume negotiations with Israel in Washington today, have put off their departure for the US in protest at the Israeli action. Mr Yassir Arafat, the chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, arrived in Damascus yesterday for talks with President Hafez al-Assad of Syria following discussions in Cairo and Amman. One of the proposals under consideration is a mini-summit involving leaders of Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon and the PLO. The five permanent members of the Security Council have all individually condemned Israel's action against the 12 Palestinians and held informal consultations last night on the possible wording of a resolution. The US is thought likely to support a resolution denouncing the expulsions if it does not go beyond that issue. Mr Yitzhak Shamir, Israel's prime minister, did nothing to prompt a different US response yesterday as he defended both the expulsion of Palestinians and the extra funds which have been voted for building new Jewish settlements in the occupied territories. The US has repeatedly condemned construction of new settlements, describing the policy as an obstruction to the peace process. 'I know that expulsions must deter terrorist acts ..(and) peace talks have to bring an end to terror,' Mr Shamir said yesterday after addressing the parliamentary foreign affairs and defence committee. Mr Shamir also defended extra funding for Jewish settlement in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, pledged to small right-wing parties to win their support for the 1992 state budget last week. 'I don't think it has anything to do with the peace talks and I don't see any contradiction between establishing some settlements and the continuation of the peace process,' he said. Asked how he would feel about a condemnation in the Security Council, even if backed by the US, Mr Shamir said, 'I'd have to say we'd be unhappy about it.'

The two international mediators wrote yesterday to Mr Dobrica Cosic, president of the rump Yugoslavia, suggesting he 'consider' including Mr Milosevic in his delegation to the talks, seen as a last chance to avoid international military intervention in Bosnia. The Serbian president, a hardline nationalist, is widely blamed for helping to foment the civil war in Bosnia but has not thus far had any formal role in the peace negotiations. The mediators' move follows Mr Milosevic's apparently positive response in talks in Belgrade on Wednesday to their proposals for a constitutional settlement for Bosnia based on a decentralised state with 10 autonomous provinces. Mr Vance and Lord Owen, who co-chair the international conference on ex-Yugoslavia, are hoping he can persuade the Bosnian Serbs to drop their demand for a 'state-within-a-state'. The first session of peace negotiations bringing together for the first time the leaders of the three warring factions adjourned on Monday after the Bosnian Serb leader, Mr Radovan Karadzic, said he needed to consult Belgrade. The Moslem-led Bosnian government also refused to sign the three documents prepared by the mediators, mainly because it disputes some provincial boundaries, but it is under intense international pressure to settle. The Bosnian Croats have already signed. At the UN in New York President Alija Izetbegovic of Bosnia evoked memories of the appeasement of Hitler and compared himself to Czechoslovak president Eduard Benes, whose country was gobbled up by Nazi Germany. In Zagreb, Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, foreign minister of Denmark, which holds the EC presidency, ruled out full military intervention in Bosnia but said more force could be used under UN mandate to protect aid missions and uphold UN resolutions.

Mr Rabin said Israeli security concerns must be dealt with in a balanced way, warning: 'Short cuts might lead to catastrophe.' Mr Arafat, in his acceptance speech on Saturday, insisted on the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Arab towns on the West Bank before elections can be held. Israeli and PLO officials said their delegations would meet again in Cairo on Wednesday for further talks.   Countries:-  ILZ  Israel, Middle East.   Industries:-  P9721 International Affairs.

The release of up to 12,000 Palestinian prisoners is considered by Palestinian peace negotiators to be the single most important confidence-building measure between the two sides, who resume talks in the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Taba today. Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's premier, has said the numbers, timing and conditions for releasing prisoners must be negotiated properly in the Taba talks. Israeli officials said the release of Mr Salim Zrei, a commander in the Fatah faction of the Palestine Liberation Organisation held by Israel for 23 years, was intended as a reward to the PLO for renouncing violence under the framework peace accord. His release comes on the eve of the arrival in Israel of Mr Dennis Ross, US co-ordinator for Middle East peace talks, who is touring the region ahead of a visit early next month by Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state. Palestinian officials have said Israeli negotiators have promised to free 4,500-6,000 prisoners in the coming weeks. Hundreds of prisoners being held on minor charges will be released in the first wave. Israeli officials have rejected PLO demands to release activists of the Islamic fundamentalist Hamas movement, including Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, the Hamas spiritual leader. The PLO, anxious to show quick results, wants Hamas prisoners freed and the remaining deportees to return home, to undercut Hamas opposition to the peace agreement. Mr Uri Savir, director-general of Israel's Foreign Ministry, indicated yesterday that this week's talks in Taba could see more significant releases in the context of mutual security guarantees. The Taba talks will also get down to more detailed negotiation about the size of the Jericho area from which Israeli troops will begin withdrawing by December 13. The Palestinians want an area of 345 sq km, the old Jordanian district of Jericho, while Israel is offering only 27 sq km, the boundaries of the town. Much of the Palestinian negotiation focuses on access to the Dead Sea and a border crossing to Jordan, with inclusion of strategic roads, water sources and religious sites.

Doubts about an early resumption of the talks in the UN increased last night as a lawsuit against one of the key participants threatened to delay his arrival in New York. However Lord Owen the EC mediator, still voiced confidence that Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serbian leader, who is the object of the legal action, would return. 'Certainly it is necessary now to get the leaders as quickly as possible here and I think it can be cleared up,' he told reporters. A 'more complicated situation', he added, was that of President Alija Izetbegovic of Bosnia, who might need some strong persuasion to drop his reluctance to attend the talks. Mr Izetbegovic was due to meet US Vice-President Al Gore in Washington this week and then go on to New York for the peace talks, but reports from Sarajevo said he might not make the trip. Mr Karadzic is threatened with a multi-million dollar civil class action that three US human rights organisations filed in a New York court 11 days ago, charging him with responsibility for atrocities carried out by forces under his control in Bosnia. Mr David Larner, a spokesman for the plaintiffs, said last night that any grants of immunity would be challenged in Federal court, although he acknowledged that Mr Karadzic need not fear arrest while he was in the US. When he led the Bosnian Serb delegation to the peace talks earlier this month, Mr Karadzic's movements were restricted by the US immigration authorities to six blocks from the United Nations building and several hotels indicated he was an unwelcome visitor. He has made it clear that he would much prefer the talks to return to Geneva and that he was unwilling to return to New York unless his security could be guaranteed, possibly through a personal invitation from Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general.

Six people were killed and 30 wounded in the bomb attack on a crowded bus in the town of Hadera. Many of the wounded were soldiers - the attack came during Memorial Day for the country's forces killed in Arab-Israeli wars. Police and witnesses at Hadera said the bomb exploded in the hands of the Palestinian attacker as he approached the bus. The attacker was among the dead. The assault in the heart of Israel was the second in a week by Hamas, which is opposed to the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks and has vowed to make five attacks to avenge the massacre of 29 Palestinians by a Jewish settler in a Hebron mosque on February 25. The bus bombing also coincided with a missed deadline last night for Israeli military withdrawal from the occupied Gaza Strip and West Bank town of Jericho. Rightwing religious parties called immediately for the cancellation of peace talks and the resignation of the government of Mr Yitzhak Rabin. However, Mr Rabin, who called the attack a 'despicable murder', said he was determined not to allow Islamic militants to wreck the fragile peace process. 'I am convinced the only answer to these murderers is not to allow them to succeed in their evil plot, which beyond the murder of Israelis is the murder of peace,' he said. In Strasbourg, Mr Yassir Arafat, Palestine Liberation Organisation chairman, said the killing 'strikes at the heart of the peace process'. But the PLO leader also launched a bitter attack on Israel, which he said had thwarted the talks by 'mass killings, detention, imposing curfews and isolating towns'. By delaying implementation of the peace process, he said, Israel 'causes these catastrophes because it gives the extremists the possibility to have a good reason to act'. In a letter to President Bill Clinton, however, Mr Arafat reiterated that he 'regretted and strongly rejected such actions because they are directed against innocent people. . . .' Although the letter did not expressly condemn either of the recent bomb attacks, the US welcomed it as a step forward.

0,FT943-11248 ,"FT943-11248 _AN-EHAC8AAVFT 940801   FT  01 AUG 94 / Rabin urges Syria to make peace move      By MARK NICHOLSON and JULIAN OZANNE      CAIRO, JERUSALEM   Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, yesterday urged Syria to make the next moves towards peace in the Middle East, renewing his calls for direct negotiations with the Syrian leadership and for a public gesture to persuade the Israeli public that Damascus was serious about reaching a settlement. His remarks followed a summit in the Egyptian resort of Taba with Mr Hosni Mubarak, the Egyptian president, who recently returned from talks in Damascus with Mr Hafez al-Assad, the Syrian leader. Senior Egyptian officials have recently played down Cairo's role in the Syrian-Israeli track of the peace talks, saying it would be 'detrimental' to open too many channels of negotiation. The sole forum for talks between the sides at present is the energetic shuttle diplomacy of Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, who is due back to the region on August 8. Talks between Syria and Israel have remained locked over the issue of the Golan Heights, from which Syria is seeking a full military withdrawal. Israel in turn wants Syria to open full trade and diplomatic relations. Mr Mubarak told reporters that Syria would 'never accept any peace treaty unless there is total withdrawal from the Golan Heights', repeating Mr Assad's crucial position in the talks with Israel. However, the Egyptian president also said that he believed Mr Assad would prove 'much more flexible' during Mr Christopher's next visit, though he declined to elaborate. Mr Rabin, who had come to 'exchange perceptions' with Mr Mubarak, according to Israeli officials, reiterated his frustration at Syria's unwillingness to meet Israelis directly and renewed his call for high-level talks. He said he understood that Israel would have to satisfy 'a few requirements' to reach peace but said that the Israeli people first required a clear signal of Syria's peaceable intent, and that he could not discuss the extent of an Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights until 'I know what I get in return'. He said: 'Syria has to do something in its public diplomacy, its public utterances that will bring the Israeli public to be convinced that Syria is eager to have a peace.' The two leaders said they also discussed the highly sensitive issue of Jerusalem - a matter which was also central to talks Mr Mubarak held with King Fahd, the Saudi Arabian leader, during a weekend trip to the Kingdom. Both leaders emphasised that the final status of Jerusalem would be addressed only in permanent status talks with the Palestine Liberation Organisation, which are due to begin in no later than two years. Mr Rabin stressed that the recent acknowledgement of the special guardianship of King Hussein of Jordan over Jerusalem - a matter deeply controversial with both the Palestinians and some other Arab states - had not changed arrangements in the city which had existed for the past 27 years. Meanwhile, thousands of south Lebanese left their homes yesterday fearing an Israeli strike against Hezbollah targets in retaliation for the recent spate of anti-Jewish bombings. Officials with Unifil, the United Nations observer force in the south, said as many as 15,000 people - around 5 per cent of the population - had left during the past week but said life continued largely as normal for those who had stayed. In Beirut, pro-Iranian Islamic militants said they would 'bombard settlements' in northern Israel if the Jewish state launched retaliatory attacks in the south. This week marks the first anniversary of 'operation accountability' during which Israel bombarded south Lebanon for a week in retaliation for Hezbollah rocket attacks into north Israel. More than 120 people died in the bombardment and 300,000 south Lebanese fled their homes.   Countries:-  ILZ  Israel, Middle East.     SYZ  Syria, Middle East.

By RICHARD BOUDREAUX, TIMES STAFF WRITER      SAN JOSE, Costa Rica      Government and rebel negotiators from El Salvador opened a new round of peace  talks here Monday after hearing a plea by Costa Rica's president to ""rectify  the history of 10 years of war in your country.""    ""Seven million Salvadorans have turned their eyes toward you, with optimism and  faith,"" President Oscar Arias Sanchez told the negotiators in a public  ceremony. ""You have an obligation to bury the past, because you do not want to  leave here as accomplices of more war.""    The stern appeal by the Costa Rican leader, who won the 1987 Nobel Peace Prize  for his campaign to pacify Central America, dramatized the pressure on both  sides to end a war that has cost 70,000 lives.    El Salvador's new rightist government and the Farabundo Marti National  Liberation Front met for the first time Sept. 13-15 in Mexico City and agreed  to try to end the fighting ""by political means in the shortest time possible""  through monthly negotiations.    This first round of substantive talks, in a suburban Roman Catholic monastery,  centered on a rebel peace plan unveiled during last month's meeting and a  government counterproposal offered Monday. Catholic leaders from El Salvador  mediated the talks, and representatives of the United Nations and Organization  of American States attended as witnesses.    The rebel plan calls for a cease-fire by Nov. 15 in return for reforming the  judiciary and the army to combat human rights abuses, as well as moving the  1991 election of a national legislature to a date in 1990. It envisions an end  to the conflict by Jan. 31, with the transformation of the guerrilla movement  into a political party and a sharp reduction of the 55,000-man armed forces.    Details of the government counteroffer have not been made public. But its  central point, announced by Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani to the U.N.  General Assembly on Oct. 2, is that all fighting must cease before serious  talks can proceed.    Arias appeared to endorse that idea Monday when he told negotiators they ""have  a lot to learn"" from the two-year-old peace process in Nicaragua. There, an  informal truce between the Sandinista government and U.S.-backed Contras took  hold in March, 1988, at the start of high-level peace talks, and still holds  despite the lack of a final armistice.    Arriving here for the scheduled two-day session, Salvadoran guerrilla leaders  ridiculed any comparison with the Nicaraguan rebels, who are apparently more  dependent on foreign support, and rejected the idea of an unconditional  cease-fire.    They also expanded their own proposal by calling for creation of a powerful  human rights body representing ""all political and social forces,"" including the  rebel front. The new body, working under U.N. and OAS supervision, would have  access to army and police jails.    Such safeguards, the rebels insist, are needed to halt the practice of  arbitrary arrests, torture and murder by government forces and right-wing death  squads and to ensure a climate of peace.    ""The impunity of those who kill and torture has to end,"" said Joaquin  Villalobos, the rebels' chief military strategist. ""It is impossible to base (a  settlement) on so simplistic a concept as a ceasing of hostilities if everybody  just keeps shooting as they please.""    Villalobos said the new demands are a response to a recent government crackdown  on the rebels' civilian supporters.    Indeed, the onset of peace talks appears to have sharpened the conflict. More  than 70 combatants on both sides have been killed in intense fighting since the  guerrillas ended an 11-day unilateral cease-fire Sept. 23, after the government  began arresting and beating leftist union leaders and other rebel supporters.    On the eve of the talks, army troops used tear gas to break up a peace vigil by  100 leftists in a Catholic church in San Salvador. The same day, the Salvadoran  air force commander, Gen. Juan Rafael Bustillo, made a fight-to-the-finish  speech that likened the guerrilla alliance to a wounded bull.    ""It's wounded, it's dying,"" he said. ""But we must not turn our backs, because  that's how great bullfighters die.""    Since taking office June 1, Cristiani has surprised his critics just by his  willingness to talk. But opposition in the military and his right-wing  Nationalist Republican Alliance has given the rebels the edge in the propaganda  war.    ""We all want peace to come to our country right now,"" Cristiani said Sunday in  a speech televised in El Salvador. ""But 10 years of fratricidal conflict is  difficult to solve. We do not want people to get frustrated if, perhaps, the  talks do not move forward at the accelerated pace that the people demand.""

You have said that  President al-Asad has not done even one percent of what he  should be doing toward the peace process, but the Syrians say  that he has done much more than that. He has stated that he is  prepared to fully recognize Israel in exchange for full  withdrawal from the Golan. He also has gone a long way by  explaining to President Clinton what he means by a comprehensive  peace with Israel. Why don't you for your part travel the same  distance that President al-Asad has travelled by specifying what  you mean by withdrawal from the Golan?    [Rabin] First of all, I am not aware that the two U.S.  officials you have named will come to the region. As far as I  know, since it has been decided to resume the talks in  Washington at the end of April, U.S. Secretary of State  Christopher and the U.S. peace team will visit all the countries  participating in the peace process to get the process going.  This is all I can say in this regard. I am going to Moscow for  four days next month and when I come back, Christopher will be  in the region. He will visit Israel the week after next. In  the meantime, we are continuing the negotiations with the  Palestinians, primarily in Cairo. We are also negotiating with  them on economic issues in Paris. President Mubarak and the  Egyptian Government are hosting the negotiations in Cairo. I  believe that President Mubarak has made a great and positive  contribution toward continuing this process and eliminating the  obstacles facing it. As regards the other parties, undoubtedly  the position of Syria is of major importance to the peace  process. I have previously stated, and I still believe, that  Israel is a democratic state. Its people must be convinced, now  that we have entered the peace process, that we must achieve  peace with all parties in the region. Naturally, no one could  do what President al-Sadat did in terms of making a breakthrough  in the Arab-Israeli conflict. There is no doubt that President  Mubarak is developing and backing the peace resulting from this  breakthrough. As for Syria, I refer to what the newspaper  TISHRIN, the official paper in Syria, published two days ago.  It severely criticized Oman for hosting an Israeli delegation  to talk about water issues. If such an attitude shows a  readiness for peace on the part of Syria, then I don't know what  opposition to peace would be like. Also, do not forget that in  the joint news conference between Clinton and al-Asad following  their talks, in which you said the Syrian president explained  his definition of full peace, none of the Israeli papers were  invited to the conference. Israeli journalists were not allowed  to ask any questions. In addition, Syria is hosting antipeace  organizations. It allows the Ahmad Jibril-led organization and  others to attack the PLO for signing the Declaration of  Principles with Israel and the Cairo Agreement and at the same  time urges the Palestinians to undermine the peace process. More  serious than this is that Syria provides all facilities to all  types of attacks on Israel, whether from Lebanon or other  places. All this does not prove that Syria has made a strategic  decision to make peace with Israel.    I also do not believe in the possibility of achieving peace  with Syria without secret meetings. We all remember that a  secret meeting took place between Major General Hasan al-Tuhami  [an aide of late Egyptian President al-Sadat] and Moshe Dayan in  Morocco in 1977. We also remember that we were engaged with the  PLO in secret talks in Oslo over six months, after which a  Declaration of Principles was reached with the PLO.    Our government was the first Israeli Government to accept  Resolution 242 as a basis for peace with Syria, which includes  agreement to withdraw from the Golan as I have announced many  times before, and this prompted the Israelis to attack me.    However, the geographical dimension of the withdrawal cannot  be determined until after Israel knows the full meaning of the  Syrians' term full peace. President al-Asad may have explained  what that meant to President Clinton as you have indicated, but  I have no knowledge that Syria's delegate to the Washington  peace talks has explained this to his Israeli counterpart at the  talks. So I cannot understand the meaning of a full peace as  envisaged by the Syrians. Besides, the problems goes beyond the  mere linking of peace and withdrawal and we have to know the  meaning of peace, the extent of withdrawal, and the security  phases that this withdrawal will pass through.    Let me remind you that the Camp David Accord was reached  after one-year-long talks, from the time President al-Sadat  visited Jerusalem in November 1977 to September 1978, and  another six months were needed to reach a peace treaty in March  1979. Six months later we withdrew to the Ra's  Muhammad-al-'Arish Line and then began the normalization between  the two countries by exchanging embassies and we completed the  withdrawal beyond the border as was agreed upon in April 1982.    In the one-year period between President al-Sadat's visit to  Jerusalem and the signing of the Camp David Accord, the Israeli  prime minister was invited to Ismailia and the Mena House  Conference was held. We also held talks at the highest level  before the Camp David Accord, 13 days after Egyptian, Israeli,  and U.S. leaders met behind the walls of Camp David, which was  isolated from the rest of the world. So far, nothing of this  kind or similar to it has happened between us and Syria.    [Wahbi] I have spoken with some Syrians about your demand  for  secret talks with Syria, but they told me that the Palestinians'  experience in the secret talks with you does not really  encourage them to repeat the same experiment with you.    [Rabin] Why?    [Wahbi] Because of the many difficulties the Palestinians  are  encountering right now, particularly since some Palestinian  leaders believe that the PLO was cheated in the Oslo agreement.  The talks leading to that agreement were held in secret and no  third party, like the Americans, was represented in them.    [Rabin] The difficulties existing now are due to the fact  that the Declaration of Principles between Israel and the PLO  tackled much more complex matters than those that might  complicate matters between Israel and any other Arab state. An  agreement with any Arab state would mean defining peace,  dividing borders, withdrawal stages, and the interrelation  between a phased withdrawal and the normalization process. When  it comes to Palestinians, we are trying to attain a certain goal  in the peace process in its entirety. That goal is how to  establish peaceful coexistence between two geographically  overlapping entities. This creates much cause for strife on a  daily basis. Many other details will need to be tackled if you  want to guarantee success for peaceful coexistence between these  two overlapping entities.    Moreover, there are people among both Palestinians and  Israelis who oppose peace and want to ruin it. Among the  Palestinians, extremist groups like ""Hamas"" and al-Jihad  Organization practice terrorism, although they know very well  that the Israeli people accept a political solution. But most  of these Israelis ask: If this solution does not bring peace to  us in our daily life, what kind of peace do you seek through the  current peace process? The operations that ""Hamas"" and al-Jihad  are carrying out create a vicious circle of violence between the  two sides. This makes an agreement with the Palestinians much  more difficult than with any Arab state.    [Wahbi] Egypt used to say to our Arab brothers that Israel  can be very difficult and might insist on the smallest details  in negotiations, but it implements any agreement it signs to  the letter. I have to tell you that many of us have difficulty  in repeating what we used to say to Arabs about the Israelis.    [Rabin] Why? Why?    [Wahbi] Since you say that agreed dates for implementing the  Declaration of Principles are not sacred, what prevents you from  announcing later on that any of the Declaration's words is not  sacred?    [Rabin] I will only give you an example to show you that  there is no justification whatsoever for saying that. We did  not delay for a single day any previously agreed date for  negotiations with the Palestinians. They delayed negotiations  with us for a month. The opponents of peace in Israel asked me  why I did not suspend negotiations with the Palestinians after  the killing of Israelis in the ""Afula and Hadera"" incidents. I  told them that if we did that in reaction to those who killed  the Israelis with the goal of ruining the peace process we would  be giving the perpetrators the best reward for their actions.    We did not delay negotiations for a single day. The  Palestinians have to realize that they cannot say that dates are  sacred. They said that they were delaying talks for a month  because of a certain horrid incident to achieve what was agreed  upon and to show commitment to the dates specified in the  Declaration of Principles. However, I say that if both sides are  prepared to reach middle solutions, which they have already done  several times, we will implement the agreement on putting the  Declaration of Principles into effect within two or three weeks  at the most after signing it.    [Wahbi] It is also being said that if Rabin is causing all  these difficulties while negotiating about the implementation of  an agreement that is not related to the questions of  sovereignty, the settlements, and Jerusalem, which have been  postponed until negotiations on the final status of the occupied  territories start, then what kind of difficulties could he cause  when the time comes to discuss these topics at the final stage  of the negotiations?    [Rabin] Why are these suspicions raised? The Palestinians  and Israelis have agreed that their agreement would not be the  same as Israel's agreement with the other Arab states. First of  all, the Palestinians do not represent a country, but an  organization. Second, it was clear to them and to us that when  the facts change and when the Palestinians are able to run every  aspect of their life, cities, villages and the enormous  responsibilities that this entails, the more difficult issues  can then be handled. This is because they would then be in a  better position to handle such issues. Also, the atmosphere  then would be more suitable because bridges of confidence  between the two peoples will have been built, or at least the  mutual hatred and suspicions will have eased.    [Wahbi] It is known that the self-rule idea goes back to the  Likud and to [Zionist leader] Jabotinsky. The Labor Party has  always talked about regional solutions that involve exchanging  land for peace. Why, then, this exaggerated insistence by the  Labor Party on the terms of the self-rule?    [Rabin] First of all, the Palestinians do not like to use  the term self-rule because it appeared in the Camp David Accord.  They prefer to use the abbreviation PISGA, which stands for  Palestinian Interim Self-Government Authority. For our part, we  have decided not to get into an argument with them over names.  Thus, the term self-rule was mentioned in the letter of  invitation to the Madrid Conference on this basis. For me, I  believe that there are two stages: a transitional stage for  building bridges of confidence and changing some realities, then  comes the stage in which the final solution will be handled and  in which we will be ready for regional solutions. We have  pointed out that we do not want to assume responsibility for  most of the Palestinians in the territories, but this does not  mean that we will be prepared to withdraw to the pre-1967 lines.    [Wahbi] It is said that by creating obstacles to the  implementation of the Declaration of Principles, Rabin is  damaging the credibility of the moderate Arab forces,  particularly Yasir 'Arafat's position. It is also said that if  Rabin continues to create such obstacles, this will cause chaos  in the occupied territories and might cause problems for Israel  itself. What is your comment?    [Rabin] I am not creating any problems, nor am I delaying  the  implementation of any agreement. If you read the Declaration of  Principles you will be certain that agreement has to be reached  through negotiations on each phase stipulated in the Declaration.    We have not postponed the negotiations and are ready to  pursue the efforts to reach an agreement that will realize the  goals of the transitional phase, overwhelm the opposition from  some forces on both sides, achieve security for the Israelis,  and grant the Palestinian council the authority to run the  Palestinians' affairs.    [Wahbi] I believe you have promised to face the problem of  the settlements in the future. The question now is how can you  deal with this difficult problem with all the trouble it entails  if you are currently refusing to evacuate about 20-30 settlers  from (Notetrim) settlement and also refuse to evacuate a handful  of settlers from Hebron even after the al-Ibrahimi Mosque  massacre?    [Rabin] Because the agreement is very clear. It stipulates  that all settlements will remain during the transitional phase  and the PLO has signed that agreement. We will turn to the  settlements when we negotiate a final solution. I expect the  Palestinians to honor their commitments as they expect me to  honor mine.    [Wahbi] About two weeks ago Israeli television showed a  documentary in which the camera proved that the settlers, at  least in some case, issue orders to the Israel army instead of  the army issuing orders to them. How true is this?    [Rabin] I have not seen this program, although I heard about  it. In any case, that situation does not exist and for our part  we will prevent that from happening. We have issued additional  orders to make sure that such an impression is not made in  future, because the army is responsible for the security of both  the Palestinians and Israelis and that is its role.    [Wahbi] It is also being said that you are using the talks  with the Palestinians to pressure the Syrians and vice versa.  Why don't you negotiate with everybody at the same time and with  the same zeal?    [Rabin] We have not suspended the Washington talks, the  Syrians decided to suspend them, then the other parties followed  suit. We are not engaged in any ""game"" at the expense of other  parties. We deal with every Arab party on the basis of the  chances of success that each issue presents. We thought we were  close to reaching an agreement with Jordan, but unfortunately  our efforts have not brought results. For our part, we have no  regional problems with Jordan basically. We have absolutely no  regional problems with Lebanon, but there are security problems  because the Lebanese Government does not enjoy sovereignty over  all its territories. We are not after a single inch of Lebanese  territory. There are international borders between us and  Lebanon. All we want is for the government there to be able to  disengage [as published] the private military groups, such as  the Druze and Phalangist militias and others. So far, the  Lebanese Government has not done anything to prove its ability  to control south Lebanon.    [Wahbi] Let me ask one final question, which concerns  Israel's internal affairs. How far is Foreign Minister Peres  authorized by you to negotiate with the Palestinians? In other  words, does Minister Peres have a real and full authorization to  reach an agreement with the PLO or do you keep the final  decision on the Palestinians in your hands? If so, why do you  refuse to meet with President 'Arafat, with whom you have not  met for a long time?    [Rabin] Every time Peres met with 'Arafat he had full  authorization, and reports about a limited authorization are  nothing but nonsense. Also, I believe that no one should  recommend a meeting between me and Chairman 'Arafat before  everything is made to prepare for such a meeting. This is  because if we meet and fail to reach an agreement, it will cause  disappointment and frustration that in fact will defeat our  purpose of reaching an agreement that can be implemented.     "

It  represents an important initiative and has created an  opportunity to break the stalemate in the peace process.    ``This stalemate was created and is sustained by the British  Government's repeated refusal to provide clarification to Sinn  Fein about the Downing Street Declaration and the processes  envisaged in it. Such clarification has been provided to all  the other parties. It should now be provided to Sinn Fein as a  matter of urgency. Direct dialogue is the obvious and most  effective method of doing this. I call upon John Major to  authorise direct and immediate talks between our party and his  Government representatives so that the peace process can be  moved forward.    ``Just as importantly, direct dialogue would also indicate a  genuine interest on the part of the British Government in  developing a real peace process through the esential recognition  of Sinn Fein's rights as a political party, the validity of our  mandate and the democratic integrity of our electorate.    ``Sinn Fein has no great concern to be engaged in bi-lateral  discussions on constitutional matters with the London  government.

The matter indicates that Ankara's  contacts with Washington and the views Prime Minister Tansu  Ciller conveyed to President Clinton when they met some time ago  have been effective. It is meaningful that President Clinton  placed the PKK at the top of the list of terrorist organizations  during the joint news conference he held with his Syrian  counterpart.    President Clinton's initiative has not yet yielded concrete  results, however. As he himself has said, the United States and  Syria continue to differ on the activities of organizations such  as the PKK and Hizballah. So, Syria has continued to remain on  the U.S. list of terrorist countries. Nevertheless, Clinton and  al-Asad have decided to establish a mechanism to remove their  differences of opinion. The U.S. secretary of state and the  Syrian foreign minister will hold talks on the matter from time  to time.    President al-Asad, who has successfully played on the Middle  East chessboard for 25 years, obviously intends to use his pawns  slowly and very carefully. He has apparently scored favorable  points in his lengthy meeting with President Clinton on the  question of peace in the Middle East....    President Clinton's talks with President al-Asad on the PKK  problem and the support he has given to the Turkish viewpoint on  the matter are undoubtedly an advantage for Turkey. That the  U.S. suggestions or pressure have not yet yielded results must  not be taken to mean that they will not be effective in the  future.    Nevertheless, the other side of the coin also has to be  considered. President Clinton and President al-Asad held talks  on the PKK problem within the framework of the effort that is  being made to establish peace in the Middle East. One aspect of  the problem between Syria and Israel is terrorism. As far as  Israel is concerned, one of the preconditions for peace is that  Syria end its support of the activities of Hizballah and other  organizations in the occupied areas, southern Lebanon, and even  in Israel itself. In view of the fact that Clinton also  supports that view, he allocated a significant part of his  meeting with al-Asad to the ""question of terrorism."" That is  how the PKK problem was discussed by the two presidents...  However, that placed the PKK's terrorist activities in Turkey  within the wide-ranging and complex context of the Middle East  problem. In other words, the problem has gained an  international aspect.    As we have already mentioned, the advantage in that is that  Syria has come under international pressure, particularly from a  superpower like the United States. The disadvantage, however,  is the possibility that the matter may become a part of the  Middle East problem in the long run. In return for the steps he  may be asked to take in the future, President al-Asad may ask  for more serious concessions. To enhance his position, he may  link that matter to the other terrorist organizations or even to  regional problems such as the question of transnational water.  In other words, he may strengthen his bargaining position. In  view of that, although President Clinton's move to draw  al-Asad's attention to the PKK problem is a favorable  development, care should be taken to prevent the matter from  becoming an international issue. The new aspect of the problem  must not overshadow the dialogue between Turkey and Syria and  the effort made to have it resolved through direct talks.    We shall discuss in another commentary the effect the  rendezvous in Geneva will have on the efforts being made to  establish peace in the Middle East and the rapprochement between  Israel and the Arab countries.    As far as President Clinton's talks with President al-Asad  on  terrorism are concerned, we are convinced the latter has gained  strength and esteem in Geneva. Syria found itself in a state of  isolation after the Soviet Union collapsed and the PLO signed an  agreement with Israel. Obviously, the United States is the only  country that can provide the foreign support Damascus now needs.  President al-Asad, who is 63, is aware of that state of  affairs. Meanwhile, Washington is convinced Syria is a key  country in the Middle East and that true peace cannot be  achieved in the region without it.    The Geneva meeting took place when the two countries  realized  that a rapprochement had to be established. It is a fact that  President al-Asad, who regards himself as a leader who cannot be  ignored in the region, has gained from his talks in Geneva and  become stronger. That will give him an opportunity to feel more  relaxed when playing his cards on various issues, including the  PKK problem.     "

Esteemed Professor Borhanoddin Rabbani, president  of the Islamic State of Afghanistan, first of all welcomed to  Kabul Mr. Mahmud Mastiri and his entourage delegation. Rabbani  expressed hope that his visit to Kabul would bring about a  positive result for peace and prosperity for the people of  Afghanistan. The esteemed president of the Islamic State of  Afghanistan then shed light on the country's political-military  situation, the unpleasant situation resulting from the failed  coup d'etat and heavy losses stemming from this coup attempt,  and measures and peace-seeking actions taken by the Islamic  State of Afghanistan.    Our country's esteemed president also spoke about work done  by the peace delegation in Kabul for securing peace and a  reliable security in Afghanistan, and for ending the war and  bloodshed. He spoke about the economic problems, especially in  Kabul, and emphasized the need for UN cooperation and  humanitarian assistance. Esteemed Borhanoddin Rabbani, president  of our country, expressed appreciation for the efforts of Mr.  Mastiri, special envoy of the UN secretary general, and in  general for the UN endeavor to end the fighting and bloodshed in  Afghanistan, and for humanitarian assistance extended to the  people of Afghanistan by this organization. He expressed  all-around cooperation by the Islamic State of Afghanistan for  securing peace and stability as well as the solution of the  country's current difficulties by talks.    Mr. Mahmud Mastiri then expressed appreciation for  statements  and goodwill displayed by esteemed Professor Borhanoddin Rabbani  for the solution of issues by talks. Mastiri expressed hope  that a reliable peace would be restored in Afghanistan as soon  as possible, that the country's current difficulties would be  solved by understanding, and that the ground would be prepared  for the extension of international assistance for the  reconstruction of Afghanistan and prosperity of the persecuted  people of Afghanistan.    Mr. Mahmud Mastiri at this meeting said that the purpose of  his visit to Kabul is to help the people of Afghanistan as much  as possible to restore peace and security and to extend UN  humanitarian assistance. The special envoy of the UN secretary  general said that he will use all available possible means so  that the people of Afghanistan can achieve peace and security.  The UN will extend every necessary cooperation in this respect.  At this meeting Mr. Mahmud Mastiri asked that the enforced  ceasefire be allowed to continue for the progress of affairs and  peace-seeking efforts. The esteemed president gave a positive  reply to this request by the UN special envoy and said: We have  declared a unilateral ceasefire in the past and now we are also  ready for the continuation of the current enforced ceasefire.  We want the current difficulties to be resolved so that a  reliable peace and profound security will be guaranteed in  Afghanistan.    The correspondent of the BIA adds: Mr. Mahmud Mastiri  arrived in Kabul this morning by a UN special flight. The UN  delegation was welcomed at Kabul airport by esteemed Najibollah  Lafra'i, minister of state for foreign affairs; esteemed Abdol  Aziz Morad, head of the presidential press office; esteemed Dr.  Abdol Hai Allahi and Hamidullah Tarzi, ministers of state;  esteemed Sayed Eshaq [surname indistinct], minister of culture  and information; esteemed Dr. Abdol Rahman; esteemed Fazl Karim  Aymaq, Kabul mayor; the acting head of protocol of the Ministry  of Foreign Affairs; and a number of other high-ranking state  officials.    Esteemed Professor Borhanoddin Rabbani and Mr. Mahmud  Mastiri  then answered questions raised by domestic and foreign  journalists regarding today's talks:    In response to a question, esteemed Professor Borhanodin  Rabbani said: This was and is the strategy of the Islamic State  of Afghanistan: to resolve issues by talks and understanding and  to secure peace. We never support the idea of resolving issues  by weapons. We are interested in the UN role for the solution  of the country's difficulties. We are interested in all  difficulties being resolved by peaceful means. Today's talks  with the UN envoy were useful.    In reply to another question, the esteemed president said:  We declare that a permanent ceasefire is to be continued in  Kabul.

0,FT921-16122 ,"FT921-16122 _AN-CAFBMACHFT 920106   FT  06 JAN 92 / Arabs debate stance on Mideast talks      By MAX RODENBECK and REUTER   MIDDLE East peace talks scheduled to resume in Washington tomorrow have been put in jeopardy as Arab participants debate how to respond to Israel's decision to deport 12 Palestinian activists. Palestinian, Jordanian, Syrian and Lebanese negotiators have postponed attendance in response to the Israeli move. Palestinian leaders say their attendance could hinge on the outcome of a United Nations Security Council session to be held today, which is expected to condemn the Israeli action. Israeli officials confirmed yesterday that their delegation would leave for Washington as planned, and dismissed the possibility of dropping the expulsion, which has drawn unusually harsh condemnation from the US, Russia, Britain, France and the EC. Diplomats in Washington said the US was likely to support a resolution condemning the deportations as long as it was limited to that issue and did not turn into a more generalised condemnation of Israel. Such a resolution would go some way towards assuaging Palestinian anger, and officials said it could help ensure that the delay in the peace talks would be brief, perhaps as short as two or three days. Mr Yassir Arafat, the leader of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, said in Cairo after talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak that a final decision on whether to boycott the talks had not yet been reached. Mr Arafat then flew to Jordan for talks with King Hussein on the fate of the peace talks. Jordan and Palestinians from the Israeli-held territories have formed a joint delegation to get round the Jewish state's refusal to talk to the PLO. Israeli newspapers yesterday quoted Mr Nabil Shaath, a senior aide to Mr Arafat, as saying that Palestinians would not boycott the talks, a move demanded in emotional appeals by families of the 12 men awaiting expulsion. But other Palestinian spokesmen made it clear they would attend only if Israel suspended the deportation order. The expulsions were in reprisal for the murder of a Jewish settler in the Gaza Strip. The 12 have appealed to the Israeli army against the deportation orders. Unidentified gunmen killed a security official of the PLO in Lebanon's southern port city of Sidon yesterday, Reuter reports. Mr Hussein Sulaiman, an official in Force 17  - the security network of Mr Arafat's mainstream Fatah movement  - was hit by two bullets as he left his house. Reuter adds from Washington: Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton, a leading US Democratic presidential candidate, yesterday backed granting Israel up to Dollars 10bn in loan guarantees to finance the immigration of Soviet Jews. President George Bush postponed the decision in an effort to launch the peace talks. He has to decide this month whether to seek further delay or request the guarantees from Congress.

Israel said it was listening with 'great interest' to Syrian proposals delivered to Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, by US Secretary of State Warren Christopher. Israeli officials said the new Syrian proposals appeared to mark a new recognition on the part of Damascus to discuss Israel's security needs. However, Israel's deputy defence minister poured scorn on Mr Christopher's shuttle diplomacy saying the US secretary of state had failed to deliver anything that would allow Israel to say they were entering a more serious Syrian negotiations. The usually cautious Mr Christopher said the two parties were now 'talking on a comprehensive range of issues' and had entered a 'new, more substantive phase'. A breakthrough in negotiations with Syria remains the key to a comprehensive regional peace accord between Israel and her Arab neighbours, including Lebanon and Jordan. The initiative emerged after Damascus rejected the idea of an Israeli withdrawal from the strategic Golan Heights, occupied by Israel in 1967, which Mr Christopher presented to President Hafez al-Assad in Damascus on Saturday. Israel, hoping tomorrow's peace agreement with Palestinians will unblock peace talks with Syria, had offered Syria a three-stage withdrawal from the Heights. Israeli media reported that under the Israeli package, Israel proposed a pull-out in three stages over five to eight years. In the first stage, Israel would hand over some territory, including Druze Arab villages, in return for establishing diplomatic relations and security guarantees. In the second phase Israel would dismantle Jewish settlements and consolidate security arrangements including a large demilitarised zone. The Israeli proposal, was the first time the Jewish state has offered such a comprehensive withdrawal package. Syria, however, rejected the Israeli proposals. Mr Farouq al-Shara, the Syrian foreign minister, said the Israeli proposals 'did not cause any change in the Syrian position. Full Israeli withdrawal is the basis for the peace process.' However, behind the rhetoric, Israeli and US officials said Damascus had formulated an interesting alternative set of proposals in eight hours of meetings with Mr Christopher on Saturday and Sunday. The Syrian proposals will form a basis for talks with further US mediation.   Countries:-  SYZ  Syria, Middle East.     ILZ  Israel, Middle East.     USZ  United States of America.

President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt made the last effort at conciliation yesterday when he met Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, in Ismaliya on the Suez Canal. The talks were the final stage of a series of contacts involving the US, Israel, Egypt, the Palestinians, Jordan and Lebanon. Senior representatives from the four Arab delegations will meet in Damascus tomorrow and Saturday to make their decision. Mr Mubarak said there were 'very great hopes' that peace negotiations would resume on schedule but neither he nor Mr Rabin offered any details on the substance of their talks. While Syria, Jordan and Lebanon have all expressed their desire to proceed with negotiations, the Palestinians have demanded that Israel should pledge not to repeat the December deportation of more than 400 men from the occupied West Bank and Gaza. Israel has indicated that it may be prepared to take back some Palestinians who had been deported over the past several years and also allow Palestinians from east Jerusalem to become members of its negotiating team. Mr Rabin confirmed yesterday that Mr Faisal al-Husseini, who comes from east Jerusalem and is the leading Palestinian in the West Bank, could in future head the Palestinian delegation. It might indicate some easing of Israel's previous insistence that it would not discuss the status of east Jerusalem, which it annexed after the 1967 war. At a news conference later the Israeli leader reassured Palestinians that their two peoples would ultimately settle their conflict based on a swap of land for peace.

Speaking to the Jordanian News Agency, the information  minister said the talks underscored Jordan's independent  character vis-a-vis the basic political decisions as well as  Jordan's efforts to maintain distinguished Arab relations in the  region and its eagerness to promote coordination among the Arab  parties to the highest possible level.    He added that the visit has deepened the relationship  between  His Majesty King Husayn and the U.S. President as the talks gave  them a good opportunity to read the ideas of each other and  enabled his majesty the king to explain the Jordanian position  in a comprehensive and accurate manner which helped the U.S.  President better understand the Jordanian position and realize  Jordan's basic role in the peace process.    Dr. al-'Anani said that by his meetings with senior U.S.  officials at the State, Commerce, and Defense Departments and  the House of Representatives, Senate, U.S. press, and several  influential U.S. figures, His Majesty King Husayn sought to  secure an understanding of the Jordanian position in order to  meet the Jordanian demands to conclude the procedures on lifting  the siege of al-'Aqabah, proceed along the peace process on the  basis of the Jordanian-Israeli agenda and the appreciation  expressed for the Jordanian democratization experiment and  respect for human rights, and improve economic and social  conditions in Jordan in spite of the large volume of foreign  debt and the increasing burdens on the Jordanian economy.    The information minister said Jordan managed to obtain an  unequivocal promise from the United States to increase its  economic aid to Jordan and to seriously consider writing off  Jordan's official debts to the United States and to cooperate  with Jordan toward rescheduling Jordanian debts during the Paris  Club meetings, slated to begin on 27 June, so that the other  creditors will reduce Jordan's debts to them.    Asked about the Jordanian role in the regional peace  process, Dr. al-'Anani said: In talks with the strongest  country, it is useful to explain the Jordanian position,  especially since its decisions, whether on the peace process or  within the rich group of states, are important and very  influential. Dialogue with a state like the United States is  required to explain the Jordanian position and acquire U.S.  support for this position.    He said: Because the U.S. arena is open for all countries,  maintaining contacts with it emphasizes Jordan's identity,  legitimate rights, and principled stands. This is what I felt  took place during the talks held during the visit.    The information minister stressed that Jordan has sovereign  demands which it should obtain through the peace process. These  are land and water. He said Jordan is perseveringly and  continuously seeking to secure the rights of refugees and  evacuees without adversely affecting Jordan's demographic or  geographic unity. He added that the U.S. side fully understood  all these points. He said the U.S. side naturally has demands;  it wishes to see Jordan and the other Arab countries reach a  peace agreement with Israel. However, this U.S. position does  not mean that the U.S. political agendas should be imposed on  Jordan; Jordan should explain its position on the need to have a  comprehensive peace. This is what took place during this visit.    Dr. al-'Anani said: We in Jordan joined the peace process in  order to restore our rights and help the other Arab parties  obtain their rights. This is the concept of a comprehensive  peace which was underscored by President Clinton after his  meeting with His Majesty King Husayn.    The information minister said: It is also obvious that some  U.S. parties would like to see a meeting between ranking  Jordanian officials and officials in Israel. However, Jordan's  position was clear. It said these meetings should not merely be  symbolic, but must have substance and lead to resolving the  basic problems. Therefore, timing such meetings depends on the  course of events and this is what His Majesty King Husayn  stressed in his meetings with the Congress and the press.    He said one of the main dimensions of the results of His  Majesty King Husayn's visit to the United States is the United  States' readiness to enable several Jordanians to increase their  exports to the United States, which constitutes the largest  market for any country in the world. He said: According to the  agreement reached between His Majesty King Husayn and President  Clinton, the Jordanian-U.S. committee held its first meeting at  the U.S. State Department yesterday. Agreement was reached that  the committee meetings should be held regularly once every six  months. During the meeting, Jordan's debts to the United States  and other creditors and the means to ease them were discussed,  in addition to increasing U.S. aid to Jordan and increasing  Jordanian exports to the United States.    The information minister said the U.S. side showed an  understanding of Jordan's defense needs and promised to meet  them. He added that it is clear that Jordan's reputation among  the U.S. officials and the U.S. people is high. All of them, he  said, expressed their admiration for Jordan's wise leadership  and the democratization process, which is considered an example  to be emulated and a pioneering experiment in the region. All  officials also expressed admiration for the respect for human  rights in Jordan. This is attested by the concerned independent  international institutions and organizations. In this regard,  Dr. al-'Anani referred to the World Bank report, which praised  the Jordanian economic policy in restructuring the economy and  increasing economic growth as well as Jordan's continuous  endeavors to improve the citizens' standard of living. The  report also stressed that Jordan, which is doing its best to  rectify its economic situation, will need to ease at least  one-third of its foreign debts so that the volume of debt will  reach an internationally reasonable level.

Israeli officials said Mr Dennis Ross, US Middle East co-ordinator, had sought to persuade the government that Syrian President Hafez-al-Assad had given firm guarantees to President Bill Clinton in Geneva on Sunday he would move to normal relations with Israel, including diplomatic and trade links, if Israel was prepared to commit itself to Syrian sovereignty over the entire Golan Heights. Officials said Mr Ross had also told Israel Mr Clinton and Mr Assad had discussed the possibility of stationing US troops on the Golan to meet security and demilitarisation demands. Mr Ross also reported that Mr Clinton had agreed to press for a public meeting between Crown Prince Hassan of Jordan and Mr Simon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, in Jordan when the US president meets King Hussein of Jordan at the White House on Friday. However, most Israeli officials believe Mr Assad made the minimum concession in Geneva which, while being an important step forward, fell short of the breakthrough US officials claim. They say Mr Assad, either in public or in private talks with Mr Clinton, did not go far enough to entice Israel to make a bold statement on return of the Golan. 'A comprehensive peace means different things to Assad, the Americans and to us,' said a foreign ministry official. 'For Assad a comprehensive peace still means the full withdrawal of Israel to pre-1967 lines including in Jerusalem and the linkage of all issues together and that is impossible for us.' Jerusalem also believes that, while Mr Assad has spoken for the first time in public, the words 'normal relations' meant little without a specific timetable. 'If Assad sees normalisation as the last station of our trip and the trip includes the resolution of all issues between us and the Arab world then that is far short of enough to help the government win over public opinion,' an official said. Other Israelis believe the Clinton-Assad summit has forced Israel into a difficult corner having won the Syrian leader an important US recognition of its central strategic role in the region. '(Assad's) main goal in the summit was reconciliation with the US,' said an editorial in yesterday's respected Ha'aretz newspaper. 'He achieved this to a degree which should worry us. . . without even ending his support of terrorism.' Israel says it will not make a formal response until the peace talks restart in Washington next Monday but it expects the peace process with Syria to remain a long and difficult road. Any territorial concession in the Golan to Syria may also have to be put to an election or national referendum. See Testing Mr Assad, Leader page   Countries:-  ILZ  Israel, Middle East.

By DANIEL WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER      JERUSALEM      Efforts to find a compromise that would keep Israel's divided government intact  were deadlocked Monday, and officials close to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir  said that he is determined to assert his authority over dovish ministers in the  teetering coalition.    ""The prime minister is standing firm,"" said Yosef Ben-Aharon, a top aide to  Shamir.    Shamir, who heads the rightist Likud Party, fired Science Minister Ezer  Weizman, from the center-left Labor Party, for making direct and indirect  contacts with the Palestine Liberation Organization and discussing peace  proposals with the group. The Sunday dismissal set off the government crisis.    However, there were wire service reports early today that President Chaim  Herzog had stepped into the crisis and suggested a compromise that might defuse  the issue. They quoted Israel Television as saying that, in a private meeting  with Shamir, Herzog said the crisis calls for a ""proper legal inquiry"" and that  Weizeman should be allowed to keep his Cabinet post until the inquiry is  completed.    Labor wants Weizman reinstated. Both parties were busily courting minor  political groups in order to build a narrow coalition should the coalition  shatter. But Labor, the junior partner in the national unity government, is  also looking for a compromise. Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Labor said he  views ""the continuation of the national unity government as the need of the  hour.""    However, Israel Television said that Shimon Peres, vice prime minister and  Labor Party leader, quickly rejected the Herzog proposal, saying the damage had  already been done.    One solution under discussion is to remove Weizman from the policy-making Inner  Cabinet, which is made up of six members each from Labor and Likud. Yitzhak  Peretz, leader of the small, religious Shas party who is trying to mediate a  compromise, reported no headway Monday. ""It is hard to say I see a way out,""  Peretz said.    Under government rules, the dismissal of Weizman, a flamboyant former fighter  pilot and defense minister, is set to become final today. A vote of confidence  in the government has been scheduled later in the week -- not because of  Weizman and the PLO but because religious parties object to government  authorization of a protest rally last week on Saturday, the Jewish Sabbath.    He's Sending Messages    Likud officials said that, by firing Weizman, the prime minister is sending out  a variety of messages, not only to political rivals at home but to Washington.    First, he is trying to re-establish his own authority, which he saw as being  eroded by Weizman's contacts with the PLO, government spokesman Yosef Olmert  said. The Labor Party, led by Finance Minister Shimon Peres, has been trying to  pull Shamir toward compromise on the issue of giving up the occupied West Bank  and Gaza Strip in return for peace with rebellious Palestinians.    ""Shamir is saying, 'I'm the boss,' in case anyone forgot,"" Olmert declared.    Shamir was also shoring up his hold on the Likud, where he was under attack for  being soft on talks with the PLO, Olmert added.    The message for Washington arises from Shamir's perception that the Bush  Administration intends to try to corner him into talks with the PLO. Shamir  opposes PLO participation in peace talks because he views the group's demand  for an independent Palestinian state as a means of setting up a hostile base  next door to Israel.    ""If people in Washington think the prime minister wants a fig leaf to talk with  the PLO, I can say that this prime minister does not play with fig leaves,""  Olmert said.    Israel is engaged in laborious talks with the Bush Administration over plans to  negotiate with a Palestinian peace delegation. The PLO has been responding to  the American overtures for talks through Egyptian mediation. Under a plan  authored by Secretary of State James A. Baker III, the United States, Egypt and  Israel have agreed to meet in the coming weeks to discuss the formation of a  Palestinian negotiating team.    Weizman expressed pleasure at being the center of a political storm. On Israel  Radio, he stated flatly that he hopes the coalition will fall over his ouster.  Weizman is a proponent of Israeli-PLO talks.    Weizman was a key participant in the crafting of the 1979 Camp David peace  treaty between Israel and Egypt. The experience converted him from a hawk -- he  belonged to the Likud at the time -- to a dove.    Reports of Weizman's PLO connection center on an Israeli Arab physician named  Ahmed Tibi, whose name had surfaced publicly in efforts to contact the PLO over  missing Israeli prisoners in Lebanon.    Weizman told a Labor Party caucus Monday that not long ago he received a phone  call from Tibi who was visiting Tunis, the headquarters of the PLO. Tibi asked  him if the PLO should accept the Baker plan for peace talks. Weizman put Tibi  on hold and phoned an unnamed Israeli official.    He went back to Tibi and advised the PLO to accept U.S. plans to hold talks and  if it had reservations, to put them in the form of conditions that could then  be negotiated.    The PLO has accepted Baker's plan in principle but is demanding that it select  the Palestinian panel.

The King, who left for London last week for a short stay in  Britain, is expected to head for Rochester, Minnesota, soon for  medical checkups at the Mayo Clinic. Following the check-up, the  King will spend a few days in the state of Colorado on a private  visit before proceeding to Washington to meet Mr. Clinton.    Prime Minister 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali and several members  of  his Cabinet are expected to head for Washington this week to  join the King in his talks with Mr. Clinton.    It will be the second White House meeting between the King  and Mr. Clinton. The two leaders met first in June.    Among the issues that are expected to be discussed between  the King and President Clinton are the course of the peace  process, U.S.-Jordan economic cooperation and military ties,  officials said.    The king will brief the president on the progress of  negotiations between Jordan and Israel, and reiterate that there  cannot be any signing of a peace agreement separate from an  overall accord addressing all the four tracks of the  Arab-Israeli negotiations launched in Madrid in October 1991.    All indications are that Sunday's summit in Geneva between  President Clinton and Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad could  produce a major breakthrough to lift the logjam in the  Syrian-Israeli track of negotiations, and, by extension, advance  the Lebanese-Israeli peace talks.    As such, analysts say, the King's meeting with President  Clinton comes at a crucial stage in the quest for peace in the  Middle East in that he would have known by then the result of  the U.S.-Syrian summit by Jan. 21 and could formulate Jordan's  next steps accordingly.    King Husayn was in touch with President al-Asad over the  phone on Thursday. Reports from Damascus said the two leaders  exchanged views on the current moves in the peace process and  means to advance the Arab-Israeli negotiations. In the  meantime, it was reported from Washington that the next round of  Arab-Israeli peace talks would begin there on Jan. 24.    On the bilateral front, the King and President Clinton are  expected to review the work of a joint  Jordanian-American-Israeli economic working group and ideas and  proposals discussed during the Middle East visit in December of  U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher.    The conclusion of an agreement on reopening Jordanian  commerical banks in the occupied territories is the only  concrete result so far of the work of the group. Negotiations  on the accord had started alsmost one year before the group was  formed during a visit by His Royal Highness Crown Prince Hasan  to Washington in October.    Proposals for joint projects and American suggestions of  ""confidence-building measures"" between Jordan and Israel are  also expected to be reviewed by King Husayn and President  Clinton.    Prime Minister al-Majali, who delayed his departure for  Washington for a few days so that he could meet with visiting  U.S. Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown on Monday, told reporters  last week that Jordan hoped ""for continuous support of the  Jordanian economy and defence forces as well as debt reduction.""    President Clinton has pledged to help Jordan in addressing  its foreign debts, and diplomats say that one of the measures  under consideration could be a write-off of part of the  Kingdom's debts to the U.S.    Amman owes Washington $946 million, including $380 million  in  military debts incurred during the 1980s, when Jordan depended  solely on the U.S. to equip its armed forces. In 1987, Jordan  turned to the then Soviet Union for its needs of a defensive  missile system after the Reagan administration flatly turned  down a $1.8 billion arms package for the Kingdom.    Jordanian-American military ties have been renewed since  then. Armed forces of the two sides held at least three joint  military exercises in the southern desert and the Red Sea after  the end of the Gulf war over Kuwait in 1991.    General Joseph Hoar, head of the U.S. Central Command, was  in  Jordan last week on his third visit to the Kingdom after  assuming office in 1991.    His Royal Highness Prince Muhammad, the Regent, and Dr.  al-Majali, who is also defence minister, held talks with Gen.  Hoar. Ideas discussed during the meeting are expected to be  explored during the King's summit with President Clinton.    Official and informed sources say that despite President  Clinton's pledge in October, even the release of up to $35  million in aid to Jordan has been held up.    The administration issued a certification to release the aid  on Sept. 15, one day after Jordan and Israel signed an agenda  outlining the basis for negotiations and a peace agreement.    Also expected to be raised during the White House meeting  are  Jordan's concerns over the de facto blockade of al-'Aqabah as  part of the enforcement of the international sanctions against  Iraq and what officials here describe as stalling at the U.N.  over Jordan's requests for permission for exports of  sanction-exempt food and medicine to Iraq.

0,FT933-6171 ,"FT933-6171 _AN-DH4CVAABFT 930831   FT  31 AUG 93 / Israel backs peace pact with PLO: Extremists from both camps threaten to derail agreement      By JULIAN OZANNE      JERUSALEM   ISRAEL last night committed itself to a historic peace agreement with Palestinians which could be a first step to ending a conflict that has wracked the Middle East for decades. Mr Yitzhak Rabin, prime minister, said Israel would sign an unprecedented accord with Palestinians at peace talks which resume in Washington today. This is expected to provide for a degree of Palestinian self-rule in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, and conditional Israeli recognition of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, according to Mr Shimon Peres, foreign minister, who concluded the agreement in secret talks with a PLO representative in Norway last week. Following the announcement by Mr Peres and Mr Rabin, an extraordinary session of the Israeli cabinet approved the peace plan by an overwhelming majority. Ministers said that 16 members of the cabinet were in favour and two abstained. Mr Peres said: 'It's a beginning and there is a lot of work ahead of us. We are determined to bring peace to the whole of the Middle East.' A senior official of the PLO confirmed the agreement and said it could be signed within 48 hours. Egypt welcomed the move, but Palestinian and Israeli extremists condemned it and warned of violent opposition. In Washington, Mr Michael McCurry, the State Department spokesman, said: 'We hope and expect that this progress will now be reflected in the next negotiating round and will lead to an early agreement on a draft declaration of principles.' President Bill Clinton warned, however, that 'we've still got a long way to go'. The agreement is a comprehensive package providing for: A five-year interim period of self-rule for 1.8m Palestinians in the territories occupied by Israel since the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. A partial Israeli military withdrawal from the occupied Gaza Strip and an undefined enclave around the West Bank town of Jericho. Mutual recognition between Israel and the PLO. If signed, and not derailed by Israeli and Palestinian extremists, the plan could hasten progress towards a comprehensive Middle East peace agreement between Israel and all its Arab neighbours. Mr Rabin told ministers it was 'a great step forward to advance Israel towards peace with all the neighbouring states and especially Palestinians. I believe this will happen'. The Palestinians will be granted full authority over their internal affairs, including policing in Gaza-Jericho, but will have lesser powers in the rest of the West Bank. Jericho, a small dusty town in the parched Jordan Valley, will become the administrative capital for the expanded elected Palestinian authority. Bethlehem will be the site of the lesser authority governing the rest of the West Bank. Israel will redeploy troops out of population centres in Gaza-Jericho, but will still provide a security role for the estimated 6,000 settlers on the outskirts of Gaza and Jericho. Israel will keep full control of occupied Arab East Jerusalem, the Israeli settlements and the Israeli-Jordanian and Israeli-Egyptian border crossings, at least until talks begin on permanent arrangements two years after the interim pact is signed. Mr Peres said yesterday Israel could recognise the PLO as part of the deal if the organisation completely renounced violent acts and gave up parts of its charter calling for the extermination of the Jewish state. Once signed, the deal could trigger progress on stalled bilateral peace talks between Israel and Syria, and Jordan and Lebanon. Public announcement of the deal yesterday sparked immediate protest. Rightwing parties in Israel's parliament heckled and shouted down Mr Peres as he tried to explain the peace package and last night up to 2,000 demonstrators protested outside the cabinet meeting. On the Palestinian side, the Islamic fundamentalist Hamas movement, the PLO's main rival, accused the PLO of betraying Palestinian aspirations and warned of a Palestinian civil war. Another extremist organisation, Mr Ahmed Jibril's Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command, threatened to assassinate Mr Yassir Arafat, the veteran PLO chairman who pushed acceptance of the peace plan through his hostile executive committee. Mr Rabin moved to deflect potential criticism among Israelis by arguing that Israel had made no concessions on the two most sensitive issues: East Jerusalem and the settlements. 'Jerusalem remains under Israeli sovereignty and is its capital. The settlements remain. None will be uprooted,' he said. An overnight poll for Hebrew tabloid Yediot Ahronot showed 54 per cent of 523 Israelis interviewed backed the plan and 45 per cent were opposed.

Indeed the seemingly tense atmosphere that characterised the  otherwise warm relations between the leaderships of Jordan and  Palestine was disturbing for people on both sides of the Jordan  River.    A majority of Jordanians and Palestinians supported the  start  of the peace talks in Madrid in 1991. They saw in Jordan  providing an umbrella for the Palestinian side a good omen and a  strong indication at the depth of ties between the two peoples.  Then, and thanks to the persistence of Palestinian negotiators  and the skill of the Jordanian team led by Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam  al-Majali, it was possible for the Palestinians to wrest from  the Israelis recognition of their status as an independent team.    Then the Palestinians and the Israelis arrived at their  declaration of principles in secret talks in Oslo. That took  Jordanians and everybody else by surprise. Yet Jordan chose,  after absorbing the shock, to declare its full support for the  agreement and for the Palestinian negotiators. And one day  after the historic accord was signed between PLO and Israel in  Washington on Sept. 13, Jordan went ahead and signed its own  agenda for the peace talks that was otherwise ready long before  but waiting for progress on the Palestinian track.    Unfortunately, the Palestinian brothers were so submerged in  their bargaining with the Israelis that they relegated their  coordination with the Jordanians. Jordan, of course, would not  have protested had it not been for the fact that every aspect of  negotiations between Palestinians and Israelis would, one way or  the other, affect Jordan. Hence, His Majesty King Husayn's  warning last week: Coordinate or else let each of us go his own  way.    Whether that warning was behind the sending its negotiating  team to Amman on Wednesday is besides the point. What has  apparently transpired is a comprehensive agreement between the  two sides on most of the issues affecting their negotiations  with Israel and understanding to hold more frequent coordination  talks between them.    Now that the two sides have settled the dispute, people in  Jordan and the occupied territories can focus their efforts on  the means to strengthening peace prospects. Meanwhile, the two  sides need to keep the momentum and work together for the good  of their peoples.     "

The news outraged Ulster Unionist politicians, who accused  President Clinton of an about-turn on his administration's  previous demand that Mr Adams should publicly renounce violence  and back the Anglo-Irish peace declaration before being admitted.    But a statement from the White House said: ""The President  supports this difficult decision and believes it will help  advance the cause of peace in Northern Ireland.""    Mr Adams will be allowed to stay only 48 hours, will be  barred from travelling more than 25 miles from New York and from  engaging in ""direct or indirect fund raising"" during his visit  for Tuesday's [1 February] conference, the White House said.    For the past 20 years the Sinn Fein president has been  barred  from entering America despite numerous efforts to gain a visa.  He applied at the American embassy in Dublin on January 14 for  the visa to attend the conference organised by the National  Committee on American Foreign Policy. The honorary chairman of  the committee is former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger  and all sides have been invited to attend the one-day  conference. But Unionist politicians have declined the  invitation, and tonight Ulster Unionist MP John D Taylor  condemned the U.S. decision as ""despicable,"" saying the Clinton  administration had ""given in"" to pressure from the Irish lobby  in Washington.    ""The White House now wishes to facilitate the apologists for  the IRA murder campaign in Ireland,"" the MP for Strangford  declared.    ""The people of Northern Ireland say to Clinton: `You should  be ashamed of yourself -- no longer can you condemn terrorism  elsewhere in the free world.'""    Mr Adams told reporters tonight that the object of his visit  was not merely to brief Irish supporters on the status of  current peace moves but to collect the views of Irish  expatriates.    The U.S. administration admitted it consulted the British  and  Irish Governments while considering the application.    London, which has an exclusion order preventing Mr Adams  from  entering mainland Britain, argued the ban should remain.    The Irish government made no public comment but is  understood  to have urged in private that the visa be granted. The Dublin  view prevailed. [passage omitted]    Mr Maginnis, MP for Fermanagh and South Tyrone, said tonight  it appeared the U.S. Government had ""watered down considerably""  its requirement for the Sinn Fein president to renounce violence.    ""I think it is disappointing that the Americans have  capitulated on something which for them should have been a  matter of principle,"" he said, adding: ""I think it diminishes Mr  Clinton.""    Mr Maginnis also said the conference would be undermined if  it was felt more important to have the presence of ""an advocate  of terrorism"" rather than representatives of the greater number  of people in Northern Ireland. [passage omitted]    Mr Taylor told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I think it's  obscene. I think the White House has lost all moral authority  and cannot condemn terrorism elsewhere in the world while they  facilitate someone like Gerry Adams.""    Mr Alderdice [Alliance Party leader] told the programme:  ""Clearly I am disappointed. There has been an enormous amount  of Republican and Irish nationalist pressure on Mr Clinton to  make this decision.""    Mr Alderdice, who is in the U.S., added: ""I'm going to put  forward the views of the majority of the people in Northern  Ireland who don't want to see the violence and regard the whole  position of Mr Adams as highly repugnant.""    Peter Robinson, Democratic Unionist Party MP for Belfast  East, said: ""Now the people of Northern Ireland will see that  democracy counts for nothing.    ""If you are a gunman then there are people who want to hear  you. There are people who will roll out the carpet for you. But  if you are a simple democrat who abides by the ballot box then  nobody wants to hear you.""    Michael Mates, the former Northern Ireland minister, told  the  programme he was surprised the U.S. had granted Mr Adams a visa  in advance of reaching agreement over the joint declaration.    ""It is exactly what Adams wants. He wants to go on being  able to procrastinate in order to put pressure on both  governments to make some more concessions before the killing  stops,"" he said.    Joe Hendron, SDLP MP for West Belfast, told the programme Mr  Adams was having problems getting agreement to the declaration  among the republican movement.    ""If getting a visa to participate in this so-called  high-powered discussion in the U.S., if this helps Mr Adams in  terms of his credibility amongst his own peers, his own  followers, then that can only be a good thing,"" he said.    Democratic Unionist Party leader the Rev Ian Paisley  accused the U.S. administration of ""kowtowing"" to the Boston  Irish Lobby and going back on previous decisions.    He said of Gerry Adams: ""He might declare a very short  ceasefire which will be hailed as a tremendous breakthrough.    ""This is a propaganda exercise. It is telling against the  British Government because the British Government are losing  every round of the battle.""    President Clinton had no authority in Northern Ireland, Mr  Paisley told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme, adding: ""He should  clean up the mess in his own back yard without interfering in  Northern Ireland.""

Mr Clinton said: 'While much work remains to be done, the IRA's decision to join the political process can mark the beginning of a new era that holds the promise of peace for all the people of Northern Ireland.' From the Massachusetts island of Martha's Vineyard, where he is on holiday, Mr Clinton said: 'I urge the IRA, and all who have supported it, to fulfil the promise of today's announcement to end the use and support of violence, just as we continue to call on all parties who have sought to achieve political goals through the use of violence to cease to do so. There must be a permanent end to violence.' Mr Clinton, who spoke by telephone yesterday morning with Mr John Major, the prime minister, and his Irish counterpart, Mr Albert Reynolds, said he was 'pleased that the US has been able to contribute to this process of reconciliation', and was ready to assist in advancing the process of peace. He gave no details of any possible increase in US financial aid to Northern Ireland. US officials are discussing a financial package, although figures have not yet been decided. White House officials said there were no plans yet for any joint meeting of Mr Clinton, Mr Reynolds and Mr Major, but they were 'aware of interest from the Irish government' in such a meeting. Privately, some White House officials see the ceasefire announcement as vindication of their decision - overriding objections from the Departments of State and Justice, and the British government - to allow Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, to enter the US in February. The European Commission said it would step up its efforts to aid the province. Mr Jacques Delors, the commission president, took the opportunity to stress the importance of the 'European dimension'. He said he would discuss 'additional financial and other measures' with the UK and Irish governments. Mrs Pauline Green, leader of the European Parliament's largest bloc, the 198-strong Socialist Group, urged 'all sections of the community in Northern Ireland to seize the historic opportunity for peace that is now before them'.

Senior PLO and Israeli officials continued to insist that a historic agreement on Palestinian self-rule would be signed within two weeks. But Palestinian negotiators from within the Israeli-occupied territories raised serious objections to the deal. The agreement provides for an Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and West Bank town of Jericho, the handover of the two areas to full Palestinian authority and a lesser degree of self-rule in the rest of the West Bank. As the US-sponsored Middle East peace negotiations entered their 11th round in Washington, Mr Warren Christopher, secretary of state, called the accord 'a conceptual breakthrough'. The European Community also welcomed the deal. But Iran denounced the agreement as an Israeli bribe to the PLO. Jordan and Syria were said to be concerned about it and Lebanon became the first Arab state to make public its reservations. Mr Mouwafaq al-Allaf, Syria's chief negotiator in Washington, accepted that progress between Israel and the Palestinians would boost peace talks. His optimism about an Israeli-Syrian breakthrough was echoed by Mr Itamar Rabinovich, Israel's chief negotiator with Syria. However, Mr Faisal Husseini, the leading Palestinian political figure in the occupied territories, yesterday insisted Israel should drop its refusal to talk about occupied east Jerusalem. According to Israeli interpretations of the deal, the PLO has given up its claims over east Jerusalem until final status talks start two years after the interim period of self-rule begins. 'I cannot accept there will be no talks on the future of Jerusalem for two years,' Mr Husseini told Liberation, the French newspaper. 'If anyone believes we Palestinians can do without East Jerusalem, he is completely mistaken. . . It is the stumbling block in the talks.' Mrs Hanan Ashrawi, Palestinian spokeswoman, also said a lot of details still had to be worked out and she cautioned against 'getting carried away by signals and symptoms before we have something really tied down'. Israel was also last night moving closer to official recognition of the PLO after a PLO official said the organisation's charter, which calls for the return of all lands which now make up the Jewish state, was null and void. Mr Uzi Baram, Israeli labour minister, said PLO recognition could be signed in tandem with a preliminary peace package. But there were conflicting signals over the conditions Israel might attach to such recognition. Mr Yossi Beilin, deputy foreign minister, said the PLO would have to drop clauses from its founding charter which called for violent acts against a Jewish state. Such a move would be extremely difficult for Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman, to take. Both Mr Beilin and Mr Arafat said separately the agreement on self-rule could be implemented within four months. Mr Beilin said Israel and the Palestinians would establish three tracks of talks to discuss how to implement the Gaza-Jericho scheme, how to achieve early empowerment of Palestinians in the remainder of the West Bank, and how to hold Palestinian elections. Under the proposed agreement, the Palestinians would run nearly all aspects of their lives in Gaza and Jericho, including policing the two areas, as Israelitroops pulled out. The Foreign Ministry yesterday said Mr Uri Savir, its director-general, had left for secret talks in Europe with PLO officials to iron out final details of an agreement and prepare a document for mutual recognition between Israel and the PLO. Norwegian officials will also attend the talks. Israeli officials ruled out a signing ceremony between Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, and Mr Arafat. Meanwhile, an opinion poll in a Hebrew daily newspaper said 74 per cent of Palestinians supported the plan.

Following one-hour talks with Serbian President Slobodan  Milosevic, Akashi told journalists that he was encouraged by  President Milosevic's readiness to support the United Nations  and UNPROFOR in their mission, and added that the talks were  very useful.    The head of the UNPROFOR mission in the former Yugoslavia  rejected the possibility that the United Nations could set an  ultimatum to the warring sides in Bosnia, stressing that the  word ultimatum does not exist in the United Nations' vocabulary.    Akashi said that he had informed President Milosevic about  an  agreement reached today with Milan Martic, president of the  republic of Serb Krajina, on the resolution of the problem that  has arisen between UNPROFOR and the Krajina police regarding the  bridge near Nova Gradiska.    We also discussed the latest developments in Sarajevo and  other important issues, such as Mostar and Tuzla, he said. The  UN envoy explained that they had discussed the opening of Tuzla  airport and said: We would like to resolve this issue in a  peaceful and diplomatic way. UNPROFOR is ready to provide  certain guarantees to those who think that the airport could be  used for other than humanitarian purposes. We are ready to  guarantee that Tuzla airport will be used for humanitarian  purposes only. If the presence of officers of both sides is  necessary we are ready to let it be so, Akashi said.    He did not rule out fresh ideas on the resolution of that  issue, which would offer greater guarantees. We think it  important to resolve that issue (Tuzla airport) through an  agreement between all sides, Akashi said.    Stating that he also discussed with Milosevic the  initiative to set up a Muslim-Croat confederation in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, Akashi said that he believed that the  initiative was good. That is a step toward a comprehensive  peace that should not, however, involve only two, but all sides,  Akashi said.    Concerning the massacre at Sarajevo's Markale market, Akashi  said that a special five-member UN commission reached a  conclusion that the shell could have been fired from Serb or  Muslim positions. We cannot ascribe the responsibility to any  of the two sides, but we are sure that a 120-mm mortar shell  could have caused such tragic consequences, Akashi stressed.    Asked about a secret UN report which says the Muslim side is  responsible for the massacre, he said that he had heard various  reports but that he had to stick to the conclusions of the five  experts.    Yugoslav Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic declared on  Akashi's departure that the talks with the head of UNPROFOR were  cordial and open and that they reiterated the desire of  Yugoslavia and Serbia to see peace in Bosnia as soon as possible.    President Milosevic, Jovanovic said, expressed deep  satisfaction at the success achieved today by Mr. Akashi and  [Serb Krajina] president Martic in normalizing the situation  surrounding the bridge across the Sava.    The president recalled the support we lent to the Vance plan  and its implementation and underlined that we were convinced all  issues that crop up could be and should be resolved through  dialogue, Jovanovic added.    The Yugoslav foreign minister stressed that the talks with  Akashi emphasized the problem of the sanctions as an obstacle to  peace, because the Muslim side is still relying on hopes that  the sanctions will help it achieve what it could not achieve on  the battlefield. He said that Akashi was told that the lifting  of the sanctions would shorten the road to peace and relieve the  Muslims of that last grand illusion.    Asked about the Yugoslav stand on the opening of Tuzla  airport, Jovanovic stressed that the Serb side in Bosnia should  negotiate and decide on that. We believe that this is basically  a marginal and artificial problem that arose when the Muslim  side had to be protected against their responsibility for the  failure of the peace plan on Bosnia. The issue of Tuzla airport  should not evolve into a problem that could threaten the peace  process, and give a fresh impetus to the advocates of the war  option to further aggravate the situation in Bosnia.    Jovanovic went on to say that this issue could be  effectively  solved by introducing control of the airport, which would  involve the Bosnian Serbs, and which would theoretically and in  practical terms rule out any possibility of the airport being  misused for other [than humanitarian] purposes.    Jovanovic stressed that the issue of opening the airport in  Banja Luka would probably be raised at the same time as that of  Tuzla airport, because that [Serb-held] area needs humanitarian  aid.

The  king made these remarks during a meeting with Jewish leaders in  Washington. Mr. Rubinstein reacted to the king's remarks during  the opening of the 12th round of peace talks in Washington. Our  correspondent Arye Golan reports:    [Begin recording] [Golan] On the very day in which the  unofficial meetings between the heads of the Syrian, Jordanian,  Lebanese, and Palestinian tracks took place, King Husayn held  his first meeting ever with Jewish leaders in Washington. When  asked for details regarding Crown Prince Hasan's remarks to  YEDI'OT AHARONOT on a warm peace, King Husayn said this includes  economic cooperation between Israel and Jordan, joint projects  in the Jordan Valley, a joint Jordanian-Israeli-Egyptian  electricity grid, a road passing from Jordan to Egypt via Elat,  etc.    Elyaqim Rubinstein, head of the Israeli delegation, was  naturally satisfied with these remarks:    [Rubinstein] Every remark by a senior Jordanian official --  especially the king himself -- regarding the contents of peace  is an encouraging sign for the upcoming talks. Naturally, we  welcome these remarks, but we could add to the king's list some  other issues that could be dealt with in the negotiations. We  would also like to hope that the rate of progress will meet our  expectations.    [Golan] All its goodwill notwithstanding, it is clear that  Jordan is not rushing to sign a peace treaty with Israel because  of what is referred to here as regional constraints -- namely,  Syria and the Palestinians.

The minister and the guest discussed bilateral relations,  the  means to reinforce and develop these relations, the latest  regional and international developments, and the peace process.  Al-Hasan explained Jordan's position toward the peace process  and the vital role it is playing, as well as His Majesty King  Husayn's efforts to bring about a just, comprehensive, and  lasting peace in the region based on the principles of  international legitimacy and UN Security Council Resolutions 242  and 338.    Al-Hasan stressed the importance of lifting the suffering  caused by the siege on the Port of al-'Aqabah and the need to  intensify efforts to stop these measures, which have resulted in  serious losses for the Jordanian economy.    For his part, Sanberk stressed the depth of the traditional  ties linking the two countries. He praised His Majesty King  Husayn's wise and enlightened leadership and the sincere efforts  his majesty is exerting to achieve peace and maintain security  and stability in the region.    In another development, the Jordanian side, led by Nayif  al-Hadid, secretary general of the Foreign Ministry, and the  Turkish side, led by Ozdem Sanberk, under secretary of the  Turkish Foreign Ministry, held talks at the Foreign Ministry  building today. The talks dealt with bilateral relations and  the need to upgrade these relations beyond coordination and  cooperation in all available fields.    Al-Hadid briefed the guest on Jordan's policy toward the  peace process and the pillars of the Jordanian stand. This  stand is represented by the need to implement the principles of  international legitimacy and Resolutions 242 and 338; Israel's  withdrawal from all the occupied Arab territories, particularly  Jerusalem; securing the legitimate rights of the Palestinian  Arab people on their national soil; restoring the Jordanian  rights to land, security, and water; and solving the refugees  problem.    Al-Hadid stressed the great importance of ending the siege  imposed on the Gulf of Aqaba in light of Jordan's commitment to  UN resolutions and its constructive stands toward the peace  process and toward the region's stability and security.    For his part, Sanberk said that Jordanian and Turkish views  were identical on the need to adhere to the principles of  international legitimacy in order to achieve a just and  comprehensive peace in the Middle East. He praised the  Jordanian role and His Majesty King Husayn's role in achieving  security and stability in the region and in pushing peace  efforts forward.    Attending on the Jordanian side were the Jordanian  ambassador  in Ankara and a number of Foreign Ministry officials.

As they settled down to bilateral talks,  Gen. Abacha remarked that economic development and security in  the West African subregion and Africa in general are best  guaranteed by the cooperation of the African countries, but in  the framework of groupings like the ECOWAS [Economic Community  of West African States] and the OAU. State House correspondent  Chris Ngu reports:    [Begin recording] [Ngu] Gen. Abacha's opening speech at the  bilateral talks was dominated by two themes: peace and economic  development in the West African subregion. He told the Togolese  delegation led by President Gnassingbe Eyadema that the pursuit  of happiness for the people of both countries should be the  cornerstone of leadership responsibility. He said that in the  face of current economic and security problems in West Africa  and developments in the world, subregional and regional  cooperation of African countries becomes imperative. Gen.  Abacha, however, noted that peace and economic development  cannot be achieved in an atmosphere of strife and discord. He  commended President Eyadema for what he referred to as the  president's peace effort in Liberia, adding that peace efforts  in Liberia should not be given up.    [Abacha] I believe our resolve under ECOWAS which formed the  basis of establishing ECOMOG [ECOWAS Cease-Fire Monitoring  Group] -- as a vehicle for establishing peace and security of  the Liberian people, as a vehicle to which democratic forces  will emerge in that country -- has to be pursued to its logical  conclusion. The conflict in Liberia should not be allowed to  continue forever.    [Ngu] On relations between the two countries, he hoped that  President Eyadema's visit will strengthen relations between Togo  and Nigeria. President Eyadema, on his part, agreed with Gen.  Abacha on the need for the warring factions in the Liberian  crisis to work for peace. He said that no businessman, local or  international, will like to invest in a country where peace and  security cannot be guaranteed. President Eyadema said Nigeria's  ECOMOG initiative is a fine example of a country that believes  in peace and security of the subregion.    Turning to the West African economy, he called for an  emergency meeting to discuss global issues facing the subregion.  A situation in which raw materials and export commodities from  the West African countries continue to attract low prices and  marked by depreciating national currencies should not be allowed  continue. Delegations of the two countries went into a  closed-door session. President Eyadema and his team, who flew  in today, have left the country. [end recording]     "
0,FT943-2783 ,"FT943-2783 _AN-EIRAQABFFT 940917   FT  17 SEP 94 / US court bars extradition of IRA man: Appeal against San Francisco ruling expected      By JIMMY BURNS   The government is expected to appeal against a ruling by a US judge blocking the extradition of a convicted IRA gunman. Ms Barbara Caulfield, a San Francisco federal judge, ruled against the extradition of Mr James Smyth on the grounds of 'the punishment, detention and restrictions on his personal liberties' that he would face on his return to prison in Northern Ireland. The ruling drew an angry reaction from prison officers in Northern Ireland and from some unionist officials. Mr Finlay Spratt, chairman of Northern Ireland's Prison Officers' Association, said the judge's decision was an 'absolute disgrace'. Northern Ireland had 'one of the most relaxed penal systems in the world'. The ruling was also seized on by Irish-Americans sympathetic to the republican cause. Mr Smyth said he planned to stay in the US 'until the British leave Ireland' and to campaign on behalf of three other Irish nationals who remain in US prisons. UK government officials yesterday played down the political significance of the ruling, indicating they would not allow it to get in the way of their collaboration with the US administration over the current Anglo-Irish peace process. They do not believe there has been any political interference with the judge's decision. Officials think it likely that a US court of appeal will eventually rule in favour of extradition. The case is not expected to be settled for some months, by which time political developments may mean Mr Smyth will return voluntarily. Mr Smyth was arrested in San Francisco in 1992 after spending nine years as a fugitive from British justice. Before the latest ruling a request for bail had been refused by a US appeal court. The government has been seeking Mr Smyth's extradition so that he can complete a 20-year sentence for the attempted murder of a prison officer and face trial for taking part in an armed mass escape from the Maze prison in 1983.

Mr Edouard Brunner, the Swiss diplomat who is mediating the peace talks on behalf of the United Nations, said yesterday the Georgian side was ready to come to Geneva 'in the next few days'. He hoped subsequently to get both parties around the same table, along with Russia which, he said, had a 'legitimate interest' in the outcome. Leaders of the self-proclaimed Abkhazian government yesterday concluded two days of talks with Mr Brunner in Geneva. Mr Anri Djergeniya, its attorney general, told a news conference that his delegation was ready to 'have a dialogue' with the Georgian government. 'That's why we're here.' Mr Djergeniya made clear that the Abkhazian leadership was not insisting at the outset on full independence from Georgia. He said this would be for the people to decide, once emotions had cooled and some stability had returned to the war-ravaged region. Mr Brunner said later that, despite their military success, the Abkhazians were realistic enough to know that they might have to moderate their political demands. The Geneva peace talks were postponed twice last month because of the renewed fighting in Abkhazia which left the rebels in control of the disputed region. These hostilities have now ended. However, the Georgian government is facing another armed challenge from insurgent forces supporting the ousted president, Mr Zviad Gamsakhurdia. Aid agencies say an estimated 200,000 refugees fled Abkhazia during last month's fighting, which shattered a Russian-brokered ceasefire agreed on July 27. The Georgian government has appealed for helicopters to evacuate up to 50,000 people trapped in the Caucasus mountains where many are already said to have died from cold and hunger. Mr Djergeniya said yesterday that all refugees, of whatever nationality, were welcome to return home. He blamed reported acts of violence by Abkhazian soldiers against ethnic Georgian civilians as the work of 'criminals'. Mr Brunner said he had been assured by the Abkhazian delegation that such acts would be sternly dealt with and that 2,000 criminal cases were already pending.

In response to questions in the Commons, Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, appeared to harden the government's position that it would only look afresh at policy if there was a genuine end to violence. Sir Patrick yesterday said peace could only be secured if terrorists turned their backs on violence for ever and not just for a ceasefire. 'To secure the peace that everyone in Northern Ireland deserves . . . (needs) a declaration by the Provisional IRA and other terrorist groups that the perpetration of violence is over and over for good. It is not a question of a ceasefire and that of temporary relief.' Details of the peace initiative have not been published, but it is understood to envisage a cessation of violence as the start of talks on Ulster's constitutional status. Sir Patrick's comments were interpreted by some MPs as a signal that the government was further distancing itself from the peace initiative created by Mr John Hume of the Social Democratic and Labour party and Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA. The Ulster unionists, led by Mr James Molyneaux, have rejected the Hume-Adams proposals as 'sheer lunacy'. The government's small majority and the continued threat of revolt has increased its dependence on the Ulster unionists. This has fuelled speculation that ministers may soon agree to unionist demands for a select committee on Northern Ireland. Sir Patrick has said it is a matter for the Commons, but it would need government support. Sir Patrick also said that an immediate resumption of formal inter-party talks on the future of Ulster would be 'counter-productive'.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

0,FT934-11425 ,"FT934-11425 _AN-DKACHABNFT 931101   FT  01 NOV 93 / Hume demands government response      By TIM COONE   MR JOHN HUME, leader of the Social Democratic and Labour Party, said yesterday that the UK government had a 'responsibility' to explore his joint peace initiative with Mr Gerry Adams, leader of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA. He was on the counter-attack after the apparent rebuff to the initiative by the British and Irish governments. 'I expect to be listened to,' he said. 'The proposals that I have put to the government are proposals that can lead to a dialogue with all parties, including Sinn Fein, in a situation in which there is no violence,' he said on London Weekend Television's Walden programme. He insisted that the joint Brussels statement by the two governments on Friday was 'only an appeal to end the violence. I am taking direct action to try and end it.' Accused by the harshest of his unionist opponents of being a fellow traveller of the IRA, Mr Hume is nonetheless a lifelong opponent of violence and has himself been the target of nine IRA attacks over the past 20 years. Inspired by figures such as Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King, he began his political career in the civil rights movement in Londonderry in the late 1960s. Unionist-inspired violence removed that movement from the streets, and was then met by growing IRA violence. Mr Hume remained throughout a constant advocate of constitutional and peaceful means to bring about change. A founding member of the SDLP in the early 1970s, he holds a conviction that nationalism, whether Catholic or Protestant-orientated, will gradually dissipate in the European union slowly being forged in Brussels. Not one to be baulked by criticism of his ideas or his tactics, he recently said: 'I am criticised for my approaches, but nobody else is putting any new proposals on the table. I want to see an agreed Ireland, not a united Ireland. I want a new Ireland in a new Europe. 'I am more confident now about the future than I have been for the past 20 years. In 10 to 20 years more there will be a whole new ball game.' On the apparent rebuff of his initiative with Mr Adams, he argued that several of the principles in the initiative had been incorporated into the Dublin government's six-point proposals, and into the communique issued by the two governments on Friday. He said yesterday: 'I am awaiting clarification of their response, but part of the process that has been proposed has already been proposed in (the Hume-Adams) initiative. 'I believe there is a way of bringing that about now which does not threaten the interests of any section of our people, that does not impose any solutions and which does not give victory to any section of our people'. The savage UFF attack in Londonderry on Saturday night, the first of its kind there for many years and a clear intimidatory warning to Mr Hume, underlines the extent to which unionist extremists oppose even the most moderate nationalist viewpoint.

On Wednesday, Mr Rabin travels on to South Korea. Swiss and European Commission officials begin bilateral negotiations this morning on matters that would have been settled if the Swiss people had agreed two years ago to join the European Economic Area. Talks will initially focus on relatively easy issues: mutual relations in research, public procurement and elimination of trade restrictions. But Brussels will insist that the Swiss cut farm subsidies to European Union levels and allow EU nationals freedom of movement in return for giving Swissair equal access to the EU open skies. The talks are unlikely to advance quickly. Peace talks aimed at ending the five-year-old war in Liberia resume today in the Ghanaian capital, Accra.

But, as he stressed yesterday, it may prove light on substantive moves to resolve enduring differences between Israel, seeking a full peace with its neighbour, and Syria, which wants a full return of the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights in exchange. 'I expect we will make some progress to narrow the gap,' Mr Clinton said of today's talks with President Hafez al-Assad, Syria's leader. 'But I do not expect it to produce a dramatic breakthrough.' Expectations for Mr Clinton's visit are running high in Damascus. 'There's a popular feeling here that this could unjam things. The average Syrian seems to believe this trip is about the most significant thing that could happen just now,' a western diplomat in Damascus said. Diplomats say the Syrians hope Mr Clinton may come bearing some Israeli concession on the Golan, or may grant Mr Assad a long-sought bilateral concession, such as erasing Syria from the list of states viewed in Washington as sponsors of terrorism. Mr Clinton has indicated neither is likely. 'Terrorism is still an issue between our two countries,' he said yesterday. 'But the most successful way to end terrorism in this part of the world is to have a comprehensive peace'. His implicit message in visiting Mr Assad seems to be that such prizes as removal from the terrorist list and further improvements in US-Syrian relations can come, but only once the peace with Israel is sealed. Mr Clinton's arrival in Damascus, a late addition to a regional swing built around yesterday's Jordan-Israel peace ceremony, will be received in Syria as the greatest possible acknowledgment of Mr Assad's regional stature and Syria's importance to any lasting peace. 'The symbolism of that cannot but help, even if it will not on its own produce the goods,' a diplomat said. The trip will also underline what the tireless Middle East shuttling of Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, has made plain: that the US will act as guarantor for any Syrian deal with Israel. Damascus, ever wary of negotiating alone and directly with Jerusalem, has always needed this assurance, adding to it repeated demands that Washington lean more heavily on its Israeli ally. 'The US should ..take stands that put more pressure on Israel to push the peace process,' Mr Farouk al-Sharaa, Syria's foreign minister, said recently. Mr Clinton's trip will affect the atmosphere surrounding the Syrian-Israeli talks, the real progress of which both sides, aided by the supremely tight-lipped Mr Christopher, have kept under wraps. It comes amid ground-breaking gestures from Syria suggesting the climate for these talks is warming. Mr al-Sharaa recently gave an unprecedented interview to Israeli television. He also met US Jewish leaders during a recent US trip. The most tangible result of Mr Clinton's visit, diplomats say, could be for him to express Syria's ultimate willingness to embrace a full peace with Israel, and what that peace would entail, more explicitly than Mr Assad is so far prepared to do publicly. Possibly, Mr Clinton may be able to announce plans for eventual direct talks between Mr al-Sharaa and Mr Shimon Peres, his Israeli counterpart, a direct encounter long sought by the Israelis. Otherwise, the substance of Israeli-Syrian negotiations will continue under US auspices and through further US shuttles in and out of Damascus. Egyptian officials and some diplomats in the region believe these talks may be only months away from a basic agreed deal. Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak has spoken of a deal by Christmas. If so, then Mr Assad and Israel's Premier Yitzhak Rabin may be awaiting the most propitious timing to make the political moves to clinch agreement. Mr Assad's desire for a 'durable, comprehensive peace' makes it unlikely he would commit himself to a deal with Israel if that with the Palestinians looked to be failing.

Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic has  stated.    Jovanovic said in an interview published in the Belgrade  daily VECERNJE NOVOSTI on Friday [21 January] that the  declaration was the cornerstone of the beginning of a process of  the normalization of relations between the F.R.Y. and Croatia,  since he said disagreements which emerge at the peace conference  on the former Yugoslavia would be resolved only later on in that  process.    The Serb Krajina is one of the open issues, and the F.R.Y.  can only help resolve the issue by political means and not  force, since the future of the Serb Krajina is strictly the  affair of the Krajina people, itself.    The joint declaration only strengthens the state of peace  and  it does not affect any of the centuries-old rights of the  Serbian people in the Serb Krajina, Jovanovic said.    Asked about the opening of liaison offices in Belgrade and  Zagreb, which Croatian President Franjo Tudjman has publicly  interpreted as a diplomatic recognition of Croatia by the  F.R.Y., Jovanovic said the liaison offices were a transitional  solution on the way of establishing full diplomatic relations,  on condition the disputed issues of interest to both countries  were first resolved.    It has been agreed that the liaison offices start working on  February 15. Serbs in Croatia will be able to seek aid from the  F.R.Y. office in Zagreb and to present possible complaints  against the actions of Croatian authorities.    Jovanovic underscored the importance of the normalization of  relations between the F.R.Y. and Croatia for the Geneva peace  talks on Bosnia-Herzegovina. He said that Yugoslavia and  Croatia had decided to strengthen peace and, thereby, also the  positions of the Serb and Croat sides in the resolution of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis.    The decision of Yugoslavia and Croatia to resolve problems  by  peaceful means has unmasked the Muslim side, which has anyway  identified itself as a side committed strictly to a war option  in the peace talks held so far, the Yugoslav foreign minister  said in the interview to the Belgrade daily.

Ministers' determination to proceed irrespective of possible DUP objections emerged last night as Mr John Major, the prime minister, confirmed he will shortly meet the leaders of all four constitutional Northern Ireland parties  -including Mr Paisley - for bilateral talks. The meeting with Mr Paisley, who yesterday spelt out two conditions for rejoining the talks, will focus on the DUP's proposals for 'breaking the logjam' and consequently is not regarded at Westminster as part of the formal process. News of the fresh round of talks came on the eve of today's Anglo-Irish conference in Belfast, which will try to put renewed impetus behind the government's efforts. The detail of Mr Major's proposals is not expected to become clear for some time and may initially be presented to those participating in the talks in further bilateral sessions and in private. The plan is, however, believed to focus on the establishment of a Northern Ireland assembly and the revitalisation of local government, which has been moribund since the imposition of direct rule in 1974. Downing Street said Mr Major would begin seeing Northern Ireland political leaders tomorrow. The first meetings are expected to be with Dr John Alderdice, leader of the moderate unionist Alliance party, and Mr John Hume, leader of the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party. The prime minister's office is trying to arrange meetings with Mr Paisley and Mr James Molyneaux, leader of the Ulster Unionist party, the biggest unionist grouping. It follows the prime minister's decision to accept a request for a meeting from Mr Hume, who wants to discuss his talks on prospects for peace with Mr Gerry Adams, head of Sinn Fein. Mr Paisley yesterday insisted Mr Hume must end his meetings with Mr Adams, before the DUP would re-enter talks. 'And until Dublin deals with Articles 2 and 3 (of its constitution which covers its claim to the North), there is no point in sitting down with them,' he added.

The mood in the occupied territories and Israel itself contrasts strongly with the upbeat assessment of the peace process provided by President Bill Clinton and Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, after more than three hours of talks at the White House on Monday. A spokesman for Mr Rabin said he would be returning three days earlier than expected from the US in order to address the problem of worsening violence. The clashes yesterday between Palestinian demonstrators and Israeli troops at the Khan Younis refugee camp in Gaza were said to be the worst since the outbursts which followed the deportation of 415 Palestinians by Israel to southern Lebanon in December. Palestinian negotiators insist they will not resume peace talks until Israel makes a public commitment not to resort to mass deportations in future. Mr Clinton said on Monday that the deportation issue had already been dealt with and had not featured in his talks with Mr Rabin. This further angered the Palestinians and Mrs Hanan Ashrawi, the spokeswoman for the negotiating team, said it was a mistake for the US and Israel to think they could just push the issue to one side. In Gaza, doctors said that a 17-year-old boy died after being shot in the chest and they had treated many more with bullet wounds, four of whom were in a serious condition. Israeli troops opened fire several times on stone-throwing Palestinians who had taken to the streets after the lifting of a curfew on the Khan Younis camp. The latest clashes come against deepening concern in Israel over attacks on Jewish civilians by individual Palestinians. Mr Moshe Shalal, the police minister, responded to rising demands for official action by promising 'not to allow the Palestinians, the Arabs and the terrorists to defeat us'. Police leave has been cancelled and recruitment is to be stepped up. At least 10 Israelis and 58 Palestinians have been killed since the upsurge in violence provoked by the expulsion of the 415 Palestinians. Further Israeli action can be expected after Mr Rabin returns from the US, with growing calls for the physical isolation of the Gaza strip from Israel if there is no reduction in the level of violence.

Israeli troops shot dead at least two Palestinians and wounded some 60 others in confrontations with stone-throwing youths. Palestinians said the violence in Hebron, where one Arab youth was killed, was more serious than the unrest that broke out after the massacre in the town. In Washington, President Clinton urged Palestinians not to abandon the peace talks, saying to reject negotiations would 'hand a victory to the extremists'. Diplomatic attempts to close the gap between the PLO and Israel intensified yesterday. Mr Karolos Papoulias, Greek foreign minister who is leading an EU effort to revive the peace negotiations, held talks in Tunis with Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman, before heading for Israel with what diplomats described only as 'some ideas'. Mr Igor Ivanov, deputy Russian foreign minister, also headed separately for talks in Israel after meeting the Palestinian leader. Despite Israeli and US opposition, international support appeared to be growing yesterday for the deployment of an international force in the territories to protect Palestinians. Mr Rabin stressed that the tragedy should not be used by the PLO as an excuse for trying to put the issue of settlements on the negotiating agenda. Instead, he said, the violence of the past six days should refocus both sides on the necessity for finalising an agreement on Palestinian self-rule. Mr Arafat yesterday restated PLO demands for returning to peace talks: the deployment of an international force in the territories to safeguard Palestinian lives, the dismantling of some extremist settlements and the disarming of the 120,000 Jewish settlers. Mr Rabin, however, said his government would not discuss settlements and settlers because the Declaration of Principles signed last September had specifically left these matters to later talks. On the issue of the deployment of an international force Mr Rabin said he had agreed to an 'international presence' but not an 'international force presence'. Officials said the prime minister had in mind a small group of observers for Gaza-Jericho only, and not for the rest of the West Bank. Talks meanwhile continued at the UN on the text of a proposed resolution which diplomats said had been sent to Tunis for consideration by Mr Arafat. Russian backing for an international force would present difficulties for Mr Rabin. Russia remains a co-sponsor with the US of the Middle East peace process. Mr Rabin said yesterday disagreement between the two co-sponsors could be exploited by the enemies of peace.   Countries:-  ILZ  Israel, Middle East.   Industries:-  P9721 International Affairs.

Amid clear indications that Downing Street will announce in the next week that it is ready to hold exploratory talks with Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, told MPs he was planning new measures to reduce the impact of the armed forces' operations. Mr Rifkind said it would be irresponsible to cut force levels in Ulster prematurely. But he told the House of Commons that the government aimed to 'make the posture of the military patrols appear less aggressive to the public'. He said: 'It can never be normal for soldiers to be deployed on the streets of the United Kingdom. Our aim is to remove soldiers from the streets of Northern Ireland - but when it is safe to do so, and not a moment sooner.' The new measures will be implemented by the GoC (General Officer Commanding) Northern Ireland and the Chief Constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary. Yesterday, Rev Ian Paisley, leader of Ulster's Democratic Unionist party, reiterated that he would not take part in peace talks over the future of Northern Ireland in spite of the declaration of a ceasefire by loyalist paramilitaries last week. Mr Paisley condemned the negotiations as a 'counterfeit peace process' and warned that the IRA was continuing to arm itself. He reserved particular scorn for Mr James Molyneaux, the leader of the Ulster Unionist party, who made clear at the weekend that he endorsed the prospect of talks between the British and Irish governments and republican nationalists. Mr Paisley accused the UUP leader of 'crawling' to Dublin. Mr Molyneaux last night had 40 minutes of talks in Downing Street with Mr John Major, prime minister, on the situation in Northern Ireland. He is believed to have reaffirmed his tacit support for the British government's plans to hold preliminary discussions with Sinn Fein. The cabinet's Northern Ireland sub-committee is expected to meet this week to make preparations for such talks.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P9711 National Security.

Do you  believe that more acts of reciprocal violence will adversely  affect the peace process?    [Rabin] I believe that the Israeli Government and its prime  minister and the PLO and its chairman Yasir 'Arafat must pursue  two parallel courses simultaneously. The first course is to  focus on the negotiations to reach an agreement on the  Gaza-Jericho First accord. This, in my opinion, is the best  response to the enemies of peace from among the Israelis and  Palestinians. The second course is that when a mistake is made  either by the Israelis or the Palestinians, such as an act of  violence or terrorism, especially if it is directed against  innocent people, we must show [sentence incomplete]. For  example, the Hebron massacre, which was committed by a mentally  disturbed Israeli murderer, is as serious as the attack on the  bus that was carrying innocent Israelis. Both the Palestinian  and Israeli sides must show that we have reached a point in  which we are trying to resolve the conflict by negotiations and  not by violence and terrorism. I myself did not listen to the  shouts of the demonstrators in Israeli towns after the brutal  acts which Hamas and Islamic Jihad carried out in Afula and  Hadera. I explained to the Israeli public that we will continue  the negotiations without delay or postponement.    The PLO suspended the talks with Israel for a month  following  the Hebron massacre. A number of Israelis asked me why they  stopped the talks after the Hebron massacre and we did not halt  them after the terrorist attacks against us. My answer was that  I am doing what I believe to be correct.    I explained this stand of mine in my telephone conversation  with Chairman 'Arafat. I believe if we want to give a real  response to the enemies of peace, we must show them that we can  reach an agreement and implement it. Any terrorist activity and  any act of violence against Israeli and Palestinian citizens  aims at obstructing the attainment and implementation of an  agreement. In the telephone conversation I explained to 'Arafat  that we will continue the negotiations as scheduled on Sunday  despite the terrorist acts. Our delegation will leave for Cairo  to resume the talks on Monday. You might ask me why the talks  were postponed from Sunday to Monday. My answer is that the  postponement was in response to a request from the Palestinian  side.    [Al-Hinnawi] Will an agreement be signed in Cairo between  the Palestinians and Israel before the end of April and during  the upcoming tour of the U.S. Secretary of State to the region?    [Rabin] In accordance to what was agreed upon in Cairo in  December, we must take into consideration that if we do not  prepare well for the upcoming meeting, it will mean failure.  And failure means frustration and disappointment. Therefore,  in the last meeting in Cairo we agreed on the following:    1. Whatever is agreed upon will be written down and  initialed.    2. Matters on which no agreement is reached will be  divided into two parts:    A. Topics necessary for inclusion in the agreements that  precede the implementation.    B. Topics that we will continue to discuss but that are  not in existing agreements; these are topics that will not  prevent us from implementing the agreement. This is how we are  working. I believe we have reached agreement on most solutions  and basic points. Anything on which agreement is reached and  which is signed must not be reopened for discussion. For  example, the Declaration of Principles that we signed in  Washington and the Cairo agreement and the maps appended to it  will not be reopened for discussion. If we do this, we will be  going around in a vicious circle. We have already wasted a lot  of time discussing matters on which agreement had been reached  in the previous two agreements.    [Al-Hinnawi] Certain reports say that if no agreement is  reached by the end of this month, you will implement what was  actually agreed upon.    [Rabin] We must sign an agreement that it is possible to  implement. In other words, when we hold negotiations over peace  with an Arab state, the agreement should be clear. Our  negotiations must revolve around the meaning of peace, the issue  of borders, the security arrangements, the stages of the  implementation of the agreement, and whether the various stages  will overlap in a way similar to what happened with Egypt.    But what we are trying to do with the Palestinians is  peaceful coexistence without division or clear lines, because  there are no dividing lines. For example, as regards the route  between Gaza and Jericho and which falls within Israel's  borders, we must allow the Palestinians to use this route. We  must, therefore, agree on the security arrangements concerning  this point. This is more difficult than reaching a peace  agreement with Jordan, Lebanon, or even Syria. The agreement  with the Palestinians is a temporary one, for self-rule. We  have approved many of the Palestinians' demands because we don't  want to waste time in search of this or that change.    [Al-Hinnawi] Did you start any unofficial secret talks with  Syria as you did with the PLO far from the press and spotlights?    [Rabin] As far as I recall, we tried to arrange a quiet  meeting with the Syrians. But they refused. I believe that  without a quiet and unannounced meeting, it would be difficult  to reach an agreement. Recent history explains this. Since  1977, no agreement has been reached without holding unannounced  preliminary contacts. Even President Anwar al-Sadat's visit to  Jerusalem could not have been made had it not been for the  unpublicized preliminary talks between al-Tuhami [an adviser to  al-Sadat] and Moshe Dayan in Morocco during the summer of 1977.  It was a long time before the majority of the Israeli cabinet  members knew about these talks. The same thing happened with  the other Arab countries. Let me say frankly, it would have  been impossible to reach agreement with any Arab state and the  PLO without the secret talks that preceded the publicized talks.    [Al-Hinnawi] Does the long calm on the Syrian front mean  that  Syria is fully concerned with peace and that President al-Asad  is fully prepared for peace? And do you believe that Syria  could accept something less than Egypt accepted during the  complete withdrawal from the Egyptian territory? And is it  conceivable that a government led by you could refuse to sign an  agreement with Syria similar to that signed between the Likud  and Egypt?    [Rabin] Let me tell you the real difference between the  Egypt-Israel peace process and the situation between Syria and  Israel. As regards Egypt, President al-Sadat took an extremely  courageous step when he came to Israel. He managed to convince  the Israeli people that there is an Egyptian leader who decided  not to continue the war and confrontation and to get involved in  the peace process and negotiations without this changing Egypt's  view regarding the achievement of peace.    President al-Sadat did 80 percent of what was expected from  the Israeli Government and the prime minister of that time in  order to convince the Israeli people to pay the price of peace.  The Israeli people hold the same feelings toward President  Mubarak, who has for 12 and half years of the 15-year old peace  between Egypt and Israel been safeguarding and promoting the  peace process.    But President al-Asad has not done even one percent of what  Egypt has done to establish peace. He did not even declare  frankly his desire for peace. I agree with you that there are  no acts of aggression on the Syrian-Israeli front. But had it  not been for Syria's help, the 10 Palestinian rejectionist  organizations led by Ahmad Jibril, Hawatimah, Habash, Abu-Musa,  and others or even Hizballah would not be able to do what they  are currently doing. Syria talks peace and at the same time  allows these organizations to attack 'Arafat and the PLO because  of their negotiations with Israel. Syria is not only hosting  these organizations, but it also allows them to operate in  Lebanon. Therefore, although Syria is not directly involved in  acts of aggression against Israel, it has made it possible for  them to act. These organizations would have never been able to  act had it not been for Syria.    [Al-Hinnawi] Very well, Mr. Rabin. You said that when  President Anwar al-Sadat came to Israel he did 80 percent of the  Israeli Government's work, because he persuaded the Israelis  that he was serious about peace. What if another Arab leader,  President Hafiz al-Asad for example, were to visit Israel?  Perhaps you would later conclude that he failed to impress the  Israeli public with his seriousness about peace?    [Rabin] It is not necessary for al-Asad or anyone else to  come to Israel. Let me tell you something. Why have I  insisted that Palestinian-Israeli negotiations take place in  Cairo and not Washington? To avoid publicity.    Another thing. We believe that Egypt has done so much and we  appreciate that. We appreciate what President Husni Mubarak and  his government are doing to help the two sides, quietly and  backstage.    When Syria went to the Washington talks, the talks were  conducted on a relatively small scale. However, every  journalist expected a statement to come out of every meeting.  This is not the best way to work things out. The talks should  begin unofficially, quietly, and away from the media.    I would not call for a meeting between me and President  al-Asad tomorrow. Such a meeting would not be useful without  quiet preparations.    [Al-Hinnawi] Reports speak of rapprochement between Israel  and a number of Arab countries. Can you clarify the picture for  us a little?    [Rabin] I believe that peace between Egypt and Israel is  what  broke the ice between Israel and Arab countries. Undeniably,  Egypt is the largest and most important Arab country. In my  modest opinion, Egypt has proved that peace can be achieved and  maintained.    Another thing. When I took over as prime minister, the  Madrid Conference formula was already in place. We did nothing  to change that formula, but sought to create another channel.    We figured that the two keys to peace in the region are in  the hands of the Palestinians and the Syrians. Jordan wants to  be out in front [as published]. Lebanon does not want to do  anything without Syria's approval.    We studied the situation and reached the conclusion that it  is better to begin with the Palestinians on the basis of two  conditions; one is mutual recognition and the second is a  statement of principles. We made a historic change in our  policy toward the PLO. This change was based on the conditions  we agreed upon and later the letters of mutual recognition  appended to the Declaration of Principles.    Once we moved toward implementing the Declaration of  Principles, the ball started rolling. For example, the  multilateral talks of the Water Committee will begin in Muscat,  Oman, today. Early next month, the Arms Limitation Committee of  the multilateral talks will meet in Qatar. This would have been  unthinkable only a year and half ago. We have begun to see  change and its continuation depends to a large extent on the  Palestinians and the Syrians.    As for Morocco, it has a large Jewish community. Actually,  there is unofficial normalization between Morocco and Israel.  Israeli citizens can go to Morocco to try and improve economic  ties between the two countries. Israeli tourists are also  allowed into Morocco.    You must not forget that, in 1977, King Hassan helped  organize a meeting between senior Egyptian and Israeli officials  in Morocco, a meeting that helped set the peace process in  motion. Although there are no diplomatic ties between Israel  and Morocco, relations between us are good.    Our relations with Tunisia may not be quite as good as those  with Morocco. But the mere fact that the PLO leadership is  located in Tunisia and that many Israelis, particularly  journalists, go there is a measure of the level of relations  between the two countries.    [Al-Hinnawi] Do you believe that Russia still has a part to  play in the peace process?    [Rabin] Russia is one of the two countries sponsoring the  peace talks. I will visit Moscow on 24 April to meet President  Yeltsin. Chairman 'Arafat will also visit Russia to meet Yeltsin  on 18 and 19 of this month.    [Al-Hinnawi] Is there not a possibility of a meeting between  you and 'Arafat in Moscow?    [Rabin] I do not think so.    [Al-Hinnawi] Is U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher's visit to the region at the end of this month  linked to the signing of the Palestinian-Israeli agreement?    [Rabin] I do not think so. If we can reach an agreement  during this time, it will be good. Christopher is coming to the  region basically to give a boost to the multilateral talks.    [Al-Hinnawi] I would like to convey to you a message from  the  people of Gaza. I was there last week and saw for myself the  extent of the people's suffering as a result of sealing off the  Gaza Strip. The people in Gaza say that the recent acts of  terrorism did not come from Gaza. The Israeli Army and police  are imposing a security cordon around the city. Supplies of  medicines and oxygen necessary for surgery have stopped and  students are not going to their colleges and workers are not  going to work. Will this continue?    [Rabin] This is untrue. I know nothing about the stoppage of  medicine and oxygen supplies. I gave orders to supply the Gaza  population with their needs. The territories were sealed only  for those who come to work in Israel.    [Al-Hinnawi] Soldiers order drivers of vehicles carrying  oxygen and heading for the Gaza Strip to go back.    [Rabin] There is absolutely no need for such measures. Even  in Jerusalem we made special arrangements for doctors, nurses,  and workers in Palestinian hospitals and Palestinians working  for international organizations to go to work. All these  workers obtained licenses enabling them to go to work. The same  thing applies to Gaza.    [Al-Hinnawi] The Palestinians in Gaza are wondering why the  Israeli Government is taking these measures right before its  withdrawal and before the Palestinian authority undertakes its  mission. Are these the good-neighborly relations that Israel is  talking about? Israel is giving the worst picture of the future  neighborly relations it is seeking.    [Rabin] Yes, but you must not forget that I do not know who  will carry out the next terrorist operation.    [Al-Hinnawi] But you, Mr. Prime Minister, are meting out  collective punishment that is harming innocent people.    [Rabin] I have no option but to continue sealing off the  occupied areas in order to know what is going on and then to  decide what I can do.    [Al-Hinnawi] Despite the security cordon imposed on the Gaza  Strip, numerous acts of violence occurred recently. The  Palestinians in Gaza are wondering about the use of this  security seal.    [Rabin] You do not know the number of operations that have  been foiled as a result of sealing off the territories. I told  the Israelis that even after the territories were sealed off we  could not completely prevent terrorist operations. In  Jerusalem, for instance, the Palestinians used a vehicle with  Israeli plates and were able to move in all parts of Israel. In  certain areas the Israelis and Palestinians are only meters away  from each other. There are no walls and we do not want walls. I  would like to tell you as a fact that there are Israeli  businessmen who have received Palestinian workers in the heart  of Israel for months without obtaining a permit. We cannot  search every house. In the two cases involving killing and  violence, we found out that two Palestinians from Khan Yunus had  been in Israel since December. The real problem is that the  situation was so aggravated because of the Hebron massacre that  certain members of terrorist organizations were aroused to the  point that they decided in a moment of extreme anger to wield  knives and hatchets to attack Israelis. Regrettably, no device  has yet been invented to reveal man's inner intentions.     "

But no new initiatives emerged from the ministerial meeting that might kick-start the stalled round-table political talks. It had been hoped that yesterday's meeting of the Anglo-Irish conference might give a fresh momentum to the talks process now that the province's local elections are over. But Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, said the UK government's proposals were still incomplete and would only be presented 'as and when the talks resume'. He said the British blueprint would not be 'an agreed paper between the two governments'. Mr Dick Spring, the republic's foreign minister, said he was satisfied that there would be further consultations between before the British paper was completed. The province's political parties abandoned negotiations last November without agreeing new political structures. The refusal by the hard-line Democratic Unionist party to sit at the table until the Irish Republic relinquishes its territorial claim to the province continues to be the main hurdle to further progress. Sir Patrick said yesterday that articles two and three of the Irish constitution, which set out the republic's territorial claim on the province, were 'a significant factor' blocking progress. Mr Spring reiterated his government's position that he would not accept preconditions and issued a plea to unionists. 'Why not come and talk?' he said. 'It doesn't help anybody to set out preconditions. We are available for dialogue.' Both ministers said they intend to initiate private meetings with the leaders of Northern Ireland's main political parties in an attempt to establish the basis for fresh talks. Sir Patrick welcomed the moves by the republic to amend extradition legislation 'to close loopholes that have recently been opened up by judicial decisions'. The question of internment, demanded by unionist leaders in the wake of the IRA's latest bombing offensive in Northern Ireland, was not discussed.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

The timing of their ceasefire announcement last week, on the eve of his speech to the Conservative party conference, was therefore either a stroke of luck for the prime minister or, possibly, a deliberate present to him from the loyalist leadership. The loyalists, like the mainstream Ulster Unionists but so far unlike the Rev Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionists, have apparently decided that 'the union is safe' in Mr Major's hands. They believe the IRA's cessation of violence since August 31 (except as a brutal method of policing its own urban strongholds) is an admission of defeat. They do not believe, as Mr Paisley does and as Sinn Fein claims to, that the IRA ceased fire only because Britain has lost interest in Northern Ireland and is looking for a way out. Mr Major's promise of a referendum on any new arrangement has reassured them, as it has unionist opinion generally. That pledge gives the majority in the province a veto which was not granted to it when Mr Major's predecessor negotiated the 1985 Anglo-Irish agreement. Opposite expectations So Northern Ireland begins this week free from the immediate fear of terrorism, for the first time in 25 years. That is a blessed relief, for which Mr Major certainly deserves his share of credit, along with his Irish opposite number, Albert Reynolds, and the leader of the main nationalist party in Northern Ireland, John Hume. But to call this ceasefire 'peace' would be premature because it is based on opposite expectations. Loyalists believe the United Kingdom is safe; republicans that they are on the way to a united Ireland. At least one of those expectations is going to be disappointed; the British and Irish governments may even, as they try to square the circle, convince both sides that they have been betrayed. That is the fear. The hope must be that peace will find its own momentum; that on neither side will paramilitary leaders wish to incur the odium of breaking it. That depends in part on those leaders themselves gaining psychological benefits from being seen as 'men of peace' rather than 'men of violence'. The effort to include them in negotiations is therefore justified. But no one should lose sight of the fact that in electoral terms these are fringe parties. They may have the ability to wreck a settlement. They do not have a mandate to negotiate one. Crucial breakthrough Much has been made of the parallels between the 'peace process' in Northern Ireland and those in South Africa and the Middle East. In so far as such parallels have any value, they suggest that the crucial breakthrough must be achieved by establishing a new relationship of trust and mutual understanding between the leaders of mainstream, representative parties in two hitherto bitterly polarised communities. That was achieved in South Africa between F W de Klerk and Nelson Mandela: the relationship reached a point where their respective communities' confidence in them depended on their ability to continue co-operating with each other and to demonstrate progress, and both understood that. Between Yassir Arafat and Yitzhak Rabin the same is objectively true, but the process is in difficulties because neither seems to be confident that the other has understood it. Between John Hume and James Molyneaux, who would be the analogous figures in Northern Ireland, the process has not really started. The job of creating such a relationship has been left to the British and Irish prime ministers. The latter certainly need to be involved, because nationalists in Northern Ireland would not have confidence in a purely internal settlement. But in the last resort trust has to be built between the two communities, and the leaders of the mainstream, representative political parties on both sides have a crucial part to play. Up to now Mr Hume has devoted his main energies to building an alliance of nationalist parties committed to constitutional methods; and Mr Molyneaux has been mainly concerned to keep the British government committed to maintaining the union. Both have succeeded, and deserve credit for their success. Now they need to concentrate on finding common ground with each other.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.     IEZ  Ireland, EC.

Mr Milosevic, whose co-operation is considered vital for any peace initiative to succeed, said before meeting Mr Vance that he would 'support any plan that would bring peace' to Bosnia-Herceg-ovina. A spokesman for Mr Vance and Lord Owen, the other co-chairman of the Geneva peace conference, said that, during the meeting, the Serbian president again expressed his willingness to support the peace effort. Mr Vance, asked later if he believed Mr Milosevic would persevere with the peace plan, replied: 'That is what he said. I am reporting what he said.' Lord Owen was due to join Mr Vance in Belgrade before flying to Zagreb for talks with Mr Franjo Tudjman, Croatia's president. It is not clear, however, whether Mr Radovan Karadzic, leader of the Bosnian Serbs, and his military colleagues would accept a number of crucial constitutional measures in the Vance-Owen plan, even if Mr Milosevic applied pressure on them. Mr Karadzic, who had talks with Mr Milosevic on Tuesday, was quoted as saying: 'We would appreciate any suggestion of Mr Milosevic's, but only if it is acceptable to us.' At the Geneva negotiations between the warring factions Mr Karadzic rejected the co-chairmen's proposals for an independent, sovereign state of Bosnia-Hercegovina divided into 10 largely autonomous provinces. Mr Karadzic made it clear that the Bosnian Serbs wanted to create their own independent state within Bosnia, while the co-chairmen have specified that the 10 proposed provinces would have no international legal identity of their own. Mr Vance and Lord Owen have stressed that the international community would not countenance an independent Bosnian Serb state, which would aim to become part of a Greater Serbia. In Belgrade Mr Dobrica Cosic, the president of Yugoslavia, comprising Serbia and Montenegro, urged Bosnian Serbs to compromise or risk western military intervention. Meanwhile, Mr Roland Dumas, the French foreign minister, told the cabinet in Paris that the three warring factions in Bosnia had agreed in principle to declare Sarajevo an open city and that forces besieging the capital would withdraw 30km from the city after a ceasefire. The city has been calm recently but last night Bosnian radio said fierce fighting had broken out in many districts.   Countries:-  YUZ  Yugoslavia, East Europe.

It emerged yesterday that Mr William Flyn, president of Mutual America, one of the biggest US insurance companies, has renewed contact with Sinn Fein while on a visit this week to Dublin and Belfast. Mr Flyn is part of a delegation of Irish-American businessmen who have been discussing investment oppor-tunities on both sides of the Irish border with government officials and local enterprises. He is understood to have used the opportunity of the visit to try to persuade Sinn Fein of the growing support within the Irish-American community for the UK-Irish peace initiative. Mr Flyn was one of the central figures behind the controversial visit of Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, to New York in February. His invitation to Mr Adams to speak at a conference on Northern Ireland led to President Bill Clinton granting the Sinn Fein leader a visa against the advice of British and US state department officials. Mr Flyn believes the visit helped strengthen Mr Adams's influence within the IRA in support of the peace initiative.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

0,FT931-9507 ,"FT931-9507 _AN-DBNAHABSFT 930213   FT  13 FEB 93 / Ulster deal may avoid Maastricht defeat      By RALPH ATKINS   THE PROSPECT of the government being defeated over the Maastricht bill has prompted ministers to consider offering to set up a Commons select committee on Northern Ireland to win the support of the province's Unionist MPs. Relaxing opposition to a committee could help win the votes of nine Ulster Unionist and three Democratic Unionist party MPs - and head off a defeat on Labour's amendment on Maastricht's social chapter. The chances of a government defeat, which could wreck the bill, heightened this week as Euro-sceptic Tories and Liberal Democrat MPs indicated they would back Labour. Sir Peter Emery, chairman of the Commons procedure committee, is seeking views on whether a committee on Northern Ireland, with powers to launch investigations, should be established. All other main Whitehall departments have a corresponding select committee. Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, has argued that a committee should only be part of a wider settlement between Unionists and nationalists. But he has stressed to colleagues that, technically, any decision on setting one up is a matter for MPs, not the government. In practice, however, the government's view would be decisive. One Northern Ireland Office insider said Unionists had a list of demands that would increase their say on the province's affairs. 'Things crop up from time to time which may make it necessary to accede to one,' he said. No offer would be made by the government until nearer the vote, at least four weeks away, and then only if the government was convinced it would otherwise lose. But it is far from clear whether a select committee would convert enough Unionists, who are strongly opposed to Maastricht. Mr James Molyneaux and the Rev Ian Paisley, the two Unionist leaders, may refuse to offer support at any price. Ministers accept that there is no logical reason why the Northern Ireland Office should not be made accountable to parliament such as other Whitehall departments, including the Scottish and Welsh offices - possibly as a justification for relenting to Unionist demands. Agreeing to a select committee, however, would undermine government policy on Northern Ireland by angering the Irish government and nationalists in the province. It could lead to further delay to resumption of 'round-table' talks on Northern Ireland. Separately, the Northern Ireland Office is preparing to come under attack from Unionist MPs when the government publishes its white paper on the future of the union between Scotland and the rest of the UK. That document is expected to be strongly pro-union and opposed to devolution  -almost the opposite of government policy on Northern Ireland. Sir Patrick wants a devolved government in Northern Ireland and says it will remain part of the UK only as long as a majority of its population so wishes.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

The talks in Cairo were also deadlocked on an amnesty for  Palestinian prisoners and a map out-lining areas of Israeli  control in the Gaza Strip, sources close to the talks said.    Sha'th, asked if there was a crisis over Palestinian  jurisdiction, said: ""Yes, there is.    ""A major problem remains to be solved... it is the problem  of  jurisdiction... It must be solved if there is any seriousness to  finish these negotiations on time,"" he told reporters.    Sha'th complained that Israel, in demanding legal authority  over Israelis and foreigners inside future Palestinian areas,  was ignoring the Declaration of Principles signed by the two  sides last September.    ""When we say that there is Palestinian jurisdiction in Gaza  and Jericho, this means that Palestinian law is the one that  prevails,"" he said.    Sha'th urged that the rules for law and courts in Gaza and  Jericho should follow international practices.    ""If a person commits a crime in London, even if he is  Belgian  or French, he is tried in London,"" he said. ""Therefore, it has  to be the same with us.    The PLO negotiator also complained about Israel's arrest  yesterday of about 400 Palestinians opposed to the peace talks,  saying the last days of negotiations should not be ""used for  more suffering and detaining and more torment of our people's  sons.""    Sha'th did not suggest pulling out of peace talks over the  legal jurisdiction dispute. He noted agreements were reached  yesterday in other areas such as broadcasting rights and  cellular telephones, and said progress was made on water sharing.    Israeli delegates did not talk to reporters yesterday about  the jurisdiction question. Delegation head Maj.-Gen. Amnon  Shahaq returned to Israel last night to brief Foreign Minister  Shim'on Peres on the talks.    Another PLO delegate, Muhammad Dahlan, said that the talks  were also still stymied on the number of Palestinian prisoners  that Israel would set free and when.    Israel has refused to release those who belong to Hamas and  those convicted of violent crimes.    Dahlan maintained that with peace at hand, all those who  took  part in the Palestinian struggle should be freed. He pointed  out that the PLO was negotiating with Hamas to overcome its  opposition to the peace process and prevent internal battles  once the Palestinians take over in Gaza and Jericho.    Meanwhile, senior Foreign Ministry officials are playing  down  expectations in advance of a meeting between Peres and PLO  Chairman Yasir 'Arafat in Bucharest, to take place either  tomorrow or Friday.    ""There will be no Gaza-Jericho signing in Bucharest,"" a  senior Foreign Ministry officials said.    It is expected, however, that Peres and 'Arafat will discuss  the issues in dispute in Cairo. Peres is likely to reiterate  Israel's opposition to PLO-Hamas coordination on issues related  to violence.    In remarks at the Knesset foreign affairs and defense  committee yesterday, Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin reiterated he  viewed PLO- Hamas cooperation on violence against Israelis as a  ""red line"" that would cause the dissolution of the Oslo accords.    At the same time, he indicated that he did not oppose  cooperation between the two in other areas such as social  welfare, sources present at the meeting said.    Foreign Ministry officials also insisted last night that a  planned meeting between Peres and Jordan's Prime Minister  'Abd-al- Salam al-Majali will not occur, since al-Majali has  decided to remain in Amman.    On the issue of Jordan, Rabin told MKs [Knesset members]  that  the Jordanian decision to confiscate the passports of two Hamas  militants in Amman demonstrated that King Husayn is ""starting to  take steps"" to move against the group.

In  their joint Anglo-Irish declaration, launched two months ago,  they held out the explicit possibility of eventual unification  of the two halves of Ireland, if that was what the people of  Ireland wanted. But the essential precondition for setting this  initiative in motion was that the IRA terrorists must first  declare a ceasefire.    That precondition has not been met. The IRA has not rejected  the offer, but the fact that it has not stopped the bombing and  shooting suggests that a permanent ceasefire is not very likely.  The UK and Irish prime ministers meet next week to see where  they go from here; it looks as though they need to think again.    The rationale for the December declaration was a belief that  the IRA was tired out after 25 years of fruitless terrorism, and  might give up. Yet even if the terrorists are tired it requires  great faith to conclude that they can now be converted to  democracy. And even if most of the terrorists were prepared to  give up, Whitehall officials seem to fear that they may be held  hostage by the out-and- out extremists.    If the IRA does not agree to give up terrorism, the two  governments must rethink their initiative from top to bottom.  Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, has said  Britain will press ahead with new moves, including devolved  local government in the province; perhaps it may. But a  political process that leaves out the hard republicans, and  perhaps the hard unionists will be a meagre affair beside the  comprehensive agenda of the December declaration.    Yet the strategic position may be less bleak than it looks  because various parts of the truth are now being made plain.  First, the declaration gives explicit recognition not just to  the undeniable old fact, that Northern Ireland is historically  and geographically part of Ireland, but also to the new  political fact, that its future will be decided not in London  but in Ireland. In the introduction to the declaration, the two  governments say their aim is a ""new political framework founded  on consent,"" and a purely British passage says ""it is for the  people of Ireland alone, by agreement between the two parts  respectively, to exercise their right of self-determination, on  the basis of consent, if that is their wish."" Neither passage  can give any comfort to rightwing nationalists at Westminster,  let alone to die-hard unionists among Northern Irish Protestants.    Such an explicit recognition by the UK of the legitimacy of  the claims of Irish unity (though only by consent) is  unprecedented. But the corollary of the principle of consent is  that terrorism, so far from advancing the cause of Irish unity,  makes it impossible. The very premise of terrorism is a denial  of democracy, the total negation of consent. In Northern  Ireland, the two communities are too evenly balanced to admit of  a victory of one over the other. IRA terrorism cannot lead to a  political victory for the nationalists, because the immediate  consequence would be more terrorism by extremist Protestants,  most probably a civil war.    If the leaders of the IRA were to take up the offer of  ""reconciliation, leading to a new political framework,"" that  would be wonderful; but it may be too much of a miracle to hope  for. If they do not, then the IRA and Sinn Fein will both be  politically dead meat. If they reject the opportunities offered  by the declaration, they will have forfeited their claim to  speak for the people of Ireland; and they will have shown that  terrorism takes precedence over politics, and that Sinn Fein is  ruled by the IRA, not the other way round.    But whether the IRA says yes or no, the central problem in  the declaration is with the definition of the concept of  consent. The reason for the terrorism by Catholics and  Protestants is that consent is lacking; and even if the  terrorism stopped, consent would still be lacking. In fact,  there is never likely to be, in our lifetimes, the kind of  political majority, either for keeping or for changing the  constitutional status quo, which could be counted on to produce  a permanent and peaceful settlement of the Northern Ireland  question.    The corollary is that the medium-term future of Northern  Ireland will be decided not by local parties or local  majorities, but by agreement between the governments of Britain  and Ireland. Sir Patrick Mayhew professes to rule out any idea  of joint authority over Northern Ireland; but in strategic  terms, that is precisely what is implied by the Anglo-Irish  declaration. When the two governments say their aim is ""a new  political framework, within Northern Ireland, for the whole  island, and between these islands,"" they are talking about  shared authority, almost a de facto condominium.    One detailed study has argued for a ""de jure condominium,""  through an Anglo-Irish treaty. This would be an extraordinary  innovation in constitutional practice, and would have  difficulties with the old-timers in the House of Commons. But  it would make logical sense, because it would rule out, for  ever, the only grounds for terrorism: the hope of total victory  by one community at the expense of the other. And it could also  make a creative political contribution to the development of  interstate relationships in the context of the European Union.    But if London dare not admit the reality of condominium, at  least let us have no more talk of self-determination. We have  seen what it has achieved in former Yugoslavia, and we do not  need that kind of self-determination in Northern Ireland.     "

Amid pessimism in Whitehall about the prospects for an end to the violence in Northern Ireland, it was clear last night that the government would go no further than to restate the principles underlying last December's declaration. Ministers agreed that the response should not be open to charges that it was obstructing genuine peace overtures from Sinn Fein. Downing Street is also anxious to avoid a serious rift with Dublin in spite of irritation at comments in the US earlier this week by Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister. Good relations with Dublin are vital if, after next month's European elections, the government is to relaunch its efforts to secure a political settlement in Northern Ireland and a successor to the 1985 Anglo-Irish agreement. But ministers agreed that the government could not be seen to be 'sitting an examination paper' set by the IRA. Mr Major believes the government cannot pre-empt any decisions or agreements reached in discussions with the province's constitutional parties, which would give Sinn Fein an advantage while the IRA continues its campaign of violence. In spite of Mr Reynolds' apparent hopes that Mr Gerry Adams still wants an end to the conflict, British ministers are sceptical about the Sinn Fein president's intentions.

The deal valued the 25.4m shares at 275p each, a discount of about 7 per cent on recent trading levels. The government said yesterday that ADM 'decided not to continue further with the discussions due to their long duration and public nature'. News of ADM's interest leaked last February, pushing the shares above what was believed to be ADM's offer of 260p. Greencore's management had encouraged ADM to make a bid as part of the company's strategic development plan aimed at using ADM's financial and marketing muscle to expand into the European market. Domestic political pressure, however, forced Mr Bertie Ahern, the finance minister, to put the government's shares out to tender with the intention of finding an Irish buyer. No other offers came forward, however, after the Greencore board made it clear that they favoured ADM. Mr Gerry Murphy, Greencore's chief executive, said yesterday: 'We are pleased at the successful placing of the government's holding which removes the market overhang of our shares.' Asked if he felt that the sale had been badly handled he said: 'It has to be said one can only be disappointed. This has gone on so long and a lot of effort was put in. 'But we have an excellent working relationship with ADM and all our options are still open and we can still work with them in joint ventures as long as it makes commercial sense for both companies'. Mr Ahern acknowledged that 'ADM went away because of the public controversy'. He attacked what he called 'the politics of the negative left', referring to opposition politicians who had objected to the sale to an overseas company. Objections had also come from the Labour Party within the government coalition. Following the failure of the public tender, Mr Ahern said: 'What I was not prepared to do was to let ADM walk away and then allow the overhang to remain. Greencore has excellent strategic plans and ADM were part of those. 'I would hope that Gerry Murphy and his colleagues will continue to look for partnerships, maybe with ADM or others that is for them to decide, but they will certainly have my full support.' The government continues to hold a 'golden share', which is intended to prevent Ireland's sugar quota within the EC being transferred to another company outside Ireland, which would threaten the livelihoods of thousands of farmers who supply Greencore with sugar beet.

The Palestine Liberation Organisation leader, who appeared to be answering strong internal criticism of his decision to sanction the process without direct PLO participation, said: 'Negotiating is a way of fighting in a calm voice. In it there is a time to attack and a time to retreat. An hour of negotiating with the enemy may be tougher than years of war.' Opposition within the PLO stems partly from a fear among senior cadres of the organisation being marginalised. Concern is also being expressed over the growing visibility of Palestinians from the occupied territories at the possible expense of the Palestinian leadership in the diaspora. Both the Popular and Democratic Fronts for the Liberation of Palestine - the two largest PLO factions apart from Mr Arafat's dominant Fatah group - have stepped up criticism of the PLO's exclusion from direct participation. Israel vetoed face-to-face negotiations with the PLO, and said it would only deal with Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza Strip.  The Financial Times   London Page 4  "

Mr James Molyneaux, the UUP leader, said multi-party talks under the old formula of nothing being agreed until everything was agreed were 'a recipe for disaster and failure.' He said the party was prepared to continue with bilateral discussions co-ordinated by Mr Michael Ancram, the Northern Ireland minister. The party's stance was condemned by Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, who said any attempt to reach an internal settlement in Northern Ireland was 'unacceptable'. Mr John Major also reaffirmed his support for the so-called three-stranded approach, covering relations within the province, between the province and Dublin, and between London and Dublin. The prime minister, who last night held talks on Northern Ireland with US president Bill Clinton, said Britain was anxious to draw a line under its dispute with Washington over the visit to the US of Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president. Launching new UUP proposals for devolved government in Ulster, Mr Molyneaux attacked Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, for 'to some extent torpedoing' the Ancram talks process by sending Dublin a checklist of ideas. There seemed to be 'a dichotomy if not worse' within the Northern Ireland Office, the UUP leader said. If Sir Patrick had not intervened, 'we might have been today in possession of a single document setting out the common ground of the four constitutional parties' in the north. Calling for the introduction of internment as part of an immediate clampdown on terrorism, he warned Mr Major that the UUP's special relationship with the Conservative party would be jeopardised if the government was not prepared to press on with restoring accountable democracy to the province. The centrepiece of yesterday's proposals was a call for the establishment of an 85-member Ulster assembly, elected by proportional representation. A separate three-member panel to oversee the assembly would also be elected. Its powers might include protecting the rights of the minority community. On relations with Dublin, the party said it would 'develop co-operation on matters of mutual interest and concern.' In the US, Mr Major emphasised that last December's joint declaration was not designed to provide a 'quick fix' in the province. It would stand to provide the foundation for a permanent settlement. The prime minister is thought to believe that the internal assembly sought by Mr Molyneaux would be vetoed by Mr John Hume's mainly Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party. This could wreck prospects for a durable settlement. Joe Rogaly, Page 20   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.     IEZ  Ireland, EC.   Industries:-  P9721 International Affairs.

Miro Lazovic, chairman of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly,  received Mohammad Zarebi, ambassador of the Islamic Republic of  Iran to Bosnia-Herzegovina, today. During long and friendly  talks, Lazovic informed the Iranian ambassador of the views of  the Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly, and the efforts of professional  legal bodies to establish peace in the country.    The Iranian ambassador expressed his satisfaction with the  establishment of peace between Bosniaks and Croats, saying that  this was an important step toward reaching a lasting and just  peace throughout the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Zarebi  expressed his government's hope that Karadzic's Serbs would join  the peace process based on the Washington document, which would  preserve Bosnia-Herzegovina as an independent and sovereign  state within its internationally recognized borders. He  conveyed the support of his country for all peace efforts on the  territory of the former Yugoslavia. The Iranian ambassador  expressed his hope that the embassy of the Islamic Republic of  Iran would open in Sarajevo as soon as possible.     "

Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq  Rabin has said that Syria's demand for full Israeli withdrawal  from the Golan in return for full peace is unacceptable. He  claims that Israel has agreed, in principle, on a withdrawal in  the Golan, and that there is some kind of connection between  peace and withdrawal on the one hand, and between security  arrangements and the timetable of this withdrawal on the other.  It is known that the Israelis make these sorts of statements on  specific occasions, and deliberately make ambiguous statements  to delude the world public, to deceive it, and to conceal the  true nature of Israel's hostility to peace. However, these  statements no longer deceive anyone. More than 27 months after  the Madrid conference, the Washington peace talks are still at  square one and there is no sign of any change in the Israeli  position. In fact, Rabin has rejected the principle of full  withdrawal from the Golan and went back to singing his old tune  on withdrawal in the Golan. He is talking about a partial  withdrawal, which Syria rejected from the very beginning, and  with which it cannot deal at all, especially since it  constitutes a violation of Syria's clear rights and sovereignty  on its territory. It is also a violation of the UN Security  Council resolutions, the basis of the Madrid conference, and the  essence of the U.S. initiative based on the land-for-peace  formula.    Syria has said many times that it will accept no compromise  in the Golan or partial or phased settlements, and that peace  and occupation cannot go together. However, the Israeli rulers,  who focus their efforts on devouring the occupied Arab  territories, adopted the policy of maneuvering and  procrastination, and of torpedoing the peace efforts from within  the Washington talks. They sought to split the negotiating Arab  ranks in an attempt to undermine the principle of a just and  comprehensive peace on all fronts of the conflict. They believe  that they can succeed on the other fronts of the conflicts just  as they have succeeded in dragging the Palestinian side into a  partial agreement that is completely at odds with the desired  peace.    Subjugating the occupied territories to a full military  siege, and escalating confrontations, clashes, and acts of  violence, proves to anyone seeking the truth that the separate  agreement did not bring peace. In fact, it has further  complicated the situation and made it even more volatile. The  Israeli officials have thus far done nothing other than stab the  international peace efforts in the back. In fact, they will be  exposing the peace process to grave danger if they insist on  their intransigent stands and their rejection of a full  withdrawal from the Golan and the other occupied territories.    It is clear that the U.S. Administration's huge financial  and  military aid to Israel contributes to Israel's intransigence.  The U.S. Administration has claimed that this aid will actually  encourage Israel to join the peace process once it is reassured  about its alleged security problems. What is happening is just  the opposite, for Israel has become more intransigent in evading  the requirements of the peace process. At the same time, its  security demands have increased. Observers who have followed  developments in the Middle East believe that the U.S.  Administration is responsible for a great deal of the stumbling  in the peace process, for why would Israel, which is essentially  saturated with a hostile and expansionist spirit, submit to the  will of peace while it is receiving unlimited financial and  military aid?

In a day of frenetic diplomacy, Mr Carter met the Bosnian Moslem leadership in Sarajevo, then drove to the Bosnian Serbs' stronghold of Pale for a further round of talks with Mr Radovan Karadzic, their leader. Mr Carter said: 'The most significant achievement this morning was that the Bosnian Serb leaders ..agreed to a complete ceasefire throughout Bosnia ..to be implemented on .. December 23'. Talks between then and January 1 are intended to work out details of the four-month ceasefire which would be 'monitored by UN forces along all lines of confrontation, with a cessation of all hostile activities'. Hopes of an end to the fighting remain slim, however, and the two sides have already expressed reservations about the agreement. Mr Alija Izetbegovic, the Bosnian Moslem president, said: 'I don't see the chance for peace but I see a chance for a ceasefire.' Mr Karadzic appeared doubtful whether ceasefire conditions about exchange of prisoners and Moslem withdrawal from the demilitiarised zone around Sarajevo would be fulfilled. Mr Carter later continued his private peace mission by flying to Belgrade for talks with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic. Members of the five-nation Contact Group, comprising the US, Russia, Germany, France and the UK, are to hold separate talks with Mr Milosevic today in Belgrade. Many previous ceasefires have been agreed and violated since war erupted in Bosnia 32 months ago. A peace plan, put forward by the Contact Group, calls on Bosnian Serbs to roll back their gains from 70 to 49 per cent of the country. The Moslem-led Bosnian government insists the Serbs must say they accept the plan before talks continue. On Monday, the Bosnian Serb leadership said it agreed to accept the plan 'as a basis for negotiations of all points.' Mr Carter's apparent breakthrough came as the UN announced that parts of the Belgrade-Zagreb motorway would re-open today for the first time since August 1991. The agreement to open the road, if honoured, could close a loophole in sanctions against the Bosnian Serbs. It is seen as a vital step for Mr Milosevic in securing extension of the provisional easing of UN sanctions against Belgrade.   Countries:-  BAZ  Bosnia-Hercegovina, East Europe.

He gave this assurance after his first meeting with Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, the international mediators on the former Yugoslavia. He spent two hours in intensive discussions on the Vance-Owen plan for dividing Bosnia into 10 largely autonomous provinces. 'We are not here to supplant the process,' Mr Bartholomew said afterwards. His remarks confirmed the impression given by Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, when he announced Washington's new policy on Bosnia last week, that the US did not have a ready-made alternative to the Vance-Owen plan, in spite of its reservations about certain of its provisions. Mr Bartholomew had talks last week in Moscow, during which Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, underlined his support for the Vance-Owen plan. The US envoy is not expected to propose any major modifications in their plan. But it is probable he will join them in proposing some modest changes to their proposed map, so as to make the provincial boundaries more acceptable to the Bosnian Moslems. Mr Vitaly Churkin, the new Russian envoy to the Bosnian peace talks, was due to meet the international mediators, including Mr Bartholomew, later in the day. But there was no sign that representatives of the warring parties, except Mr Mate Boban, the Bosnian Croat leader, were ready to resume the talks, which were in abeyance pending last week's US policy announcement. Bosnia's Moslem President Alija Izetbegovic is due to visit Washington at the weekend but has not announced firm plans to go to New York. It is understood that US officials will try to persuade him to resume his participation in the peace talks as soon as possible. Mr Radovan Karadzic, leader of the Bosnian Serbs, has declined to rejoin the talks in the absence of Mr Izetbegovic.   Countries:-  USZ  United States of America.

Statements by King  Husayn during his recent visit to Washington and editorials in  Jordan's mainstream press have strongly countered charges that  the current negotiations betray pan-Arab ideals, while  nonetheless arguing that Jordan must attend to its own interests  in the peace process.  While the opposition's vocal criticism  will probably continue, it appears unlikely to disrupt the  government's agenda.                                       END SUMMARY        Jordan Determined To Proceed With Israel Negotiations     At his 21 June Washington press conference, King Husayn replied  to criticism that his government had sacrificed pan-Arab ideals  to achieve progress in talks with Israel and declared that Jordan  is prepared to proceed with negotiations on matters--such as  borders and water rights--that concern Jordan's sovereignty  independently of progress in negotiations between Israel and  other Arab parties.  He asserted that since ""no other country in  the Arab world"" had contributed more to Palestinian and pan-Arab  causes than Jordan, ""nobody has the right to [tell Jordan] what  to do"" in its policy toward Israel.  While Husayn said he  eventually hoped to see ""the coming together of a comprehensive  peace in the region,"" he stressed that above all, he is ""aware of  [his] responsibilities towards [his] people, and [is] carrying  them out.""  When questioned about Syrian criticism of Jordan's  talks with Israel, he replied indirectly and with apparent  irritation, asking rhetorically: ""Is Jordan expected to be the  last one to ratify a peace treaty?""  Moreover, the king indicated  several times throughout the press conference that pan-Arab  coordination on the Arab-Israeli peace talks had never been  achieved at an acceptable level and that, while he hoped for  progress on all tracks of the process, Jordan's talks with Israel  are ""a question of a sovereign matter regarding Jordan itself,""  and are not ""tied to movement on another track"" (Amman TV, 21  June).     Significantly, King Husayn stopped short of categorically stating  that Amman would not sign a final agreement with Israel before  the attainment of a comprehensive peace.  Asked whether he would  be willing to sign a peace treaty with Israel independently of  the other tracks, Husayn responded that while Jordan is  ""searching for a comprehensive peace,"" it is a ""sovereign  country"" that is ""dealing with [its] own problems,"" adding: ""We  [Jordanians] started at the same point, and we are trying to see  what we can achieve"" (Amman TV, 21 June).     Editorials Hail Pragmatism, Ridicule Opponents     Editorials in Jordan's establishment press praised the  government's stance toward Israel as being practical and  farsighted, and combined support for border and water  negotiations with firm reiterations of Jordan's commitment to a  comprehensive final peace arrangement on all tracks.  In  addition, several newspaper columns made disparaging references  to opponents of the negotiations.     --A column in Al-Dustur urged ""starry-eyed"" citizens to ""wake up""  to a transformed Middle East, adding that talks between Jordan  and Israel are ""nothing to be ashamed of,"" and that ""the day is  not far off when Israel will have embassies in Arab capitals.""  In a thinly veiled swipe at opponents of the government's policy,  the column concluded that Amman ""cannot possibly be the citadel  of verbal Arab rejectionism, whose bark has, over decades, been  worse than its bite"" (21 June).     --An Al-Ra'y editorial praised the ""Jordanian Arab futuristic  view of the comprehensive peace"" that would start with border and  water talks and proceed to ""security, joint cooperation, and  other issues within the framework of the comprehensive peace.""  In a likely reference to critical articles published in the  opposition press, the editorial went on to denounce the ""media  clamor"" over Jordan's unilateral moves as unwarranted,  ""especially since Jordan has always promoted Arab solidarity and  encouraged Arab solutions to all the nation's issues"" (13 June).     Opposition Reaction     Various opposition political parties, most prominently the Muslim  Brotherhood-backed Islamic Action Front (IAF), have taken  advantage of greater press freedom brought about by the king's  cautious political liberalization to publicize a hard line  against the government's course.  They have categorically  rejected separate negotiations with Israel, accusing the  government of deserting the Palestinian cause, damaging pan-Arab  coordination, and abandoning the principle of a comprehensive  solution.  The IAF, which has 16 members in the House of  Representatives, also criticized Jordan's recent cabinet  reshuffle, which brought 10 House deputies into the cabinet as  ministers, (See Note 1) as a move aimed solely at consolidating  government support for its negotiations with Israel.     (Note 1) Apparently, the cabinet reshuffle was intended to  preempt parliamentary attacks on the government's peace process  policy.  Information Minister Jawad al-'Anani stated that the  ministerial shakeup was intended to ""consolidate cooperation  between the [executive and legislative] arms of government and  strengthen the performance of the cabinet in light of the fast  changes in the area and the peace process"" (Jordan Times, 9-10  June).     --IAF deputies in the House of Representatives issued a statement  rejecting Jordan's negotiations with the ""Zionist enemy,""  asserting that the bilateral agendas signed in Washington  ""reflect a Jordanian retreat from the constant principles"" of  ""rejecting a unilateral peace, adhering to the Islamic and Arab  character of Jerusalem, and the right of refugees to return to  their country and territories from which they were expelled by  the usurper Jews.""  The statement also warned the government  against ""making the same mistake as the Palestinian negotiator by  throwing himself into the lap of the Zionist entity"" (Al-Majd, 20  June).     --The Jordanian Arab Constitutional Front Party warned that the  government's stance ""constitutes an imminent threat to Jordan and  the Palestinian cause and harms the cooperation and coordination  between the Arab brothers in Syria and Lebanon"" (Al-Majd, 20  June).     --A joint statement issued by the IAF and the Pan-Arab Action  Front (PAAF) condemned Jordan's 8 June cabinet reshuffle as being  ""aimed at weakening the opposition in the House of  Representatives . . . in order to go ahead with plans to sign a  unilateral reconciliation agreement with the Zionist enemy.""  The  joint IAF-PAAF statement also accused the government of deviating  from its ""so-called national constants that focused on a  comprehensive solution, the return of Jerusalem, and solving the  problem of refugees"" (Al-Sabil, 21-27 June).     --A statement by the secretary of the Jordanian Arab Socialist  Ba'th Party's Supreme Command emphasized ""the need for pan-Arab  solutions to any regional issue, since solutions to any regional,  political, or economic issues will be incomplete if not discussed  and addressed within the framework of the comprehensive Arab  solution"" (Al-Ra'y, 14 June)        Syria Criticizes Israeli-Jordanian Diplomacy     Steadily escalating attacks on Jordan in Syria's tightly  controlled media illustrate Damascus' irritation over indications  of significant progress in the 6-7 June talks between Jordan and  Israel.  For example, a Damascus radio report on 22 June appeared  to launch an indirect attack on King Husayn himself.  The report  first cited optimistic statements by the king and other unnamed  Jordanian officials on the course of Israeli-Jordanian  negotiations, made during the the king's recent visit to the  United States.  The radio went on, however, to quote extensively  from what it said were Jordanian opposition statements, including  such comments as: ""the Israeli-Jordanian agenda is another step  in the political capitulationist settlement plan"" and ""the  Jordanian Government has placed the country in a dark political  tunnel.""     Following the 6-7 June talks, Syrian media initially voiced  Syria's concern without criticizing the Jordanian Government.  On  8 June, for example, the daily Tishrin harshly condemned  Jordanian journalist Fahd al-Fanik's calls in two recent columns  (Amman Al-Ra'y, 2  4 June) for Jordan to move forward in  negotiating a peace treaty with Israel.  The next day, Damascus  radio reported that Jordanian Prime Minister 'Abd-al-Salam al-  Majali had denied press reports that he had criticized Syria and  had expressed ""absolute faith"" in the ""common objectives and  destiny"" of Jordan and Syria.     Within the next several days, however, Damascus radio adopted an  openly critical tone.  On the 11th, it hinted at official  dissatisfaction, reporting that Syria had postponed a scheduled  meeting that day of the Joint Syrian-Jordanian Higher Committee-  -a body promoting bilateral cooperation--because ""both the date  and circumstances are not suitable for the Syrian side.""  By the  12th, the radio all but openly attacked Jordan.  After repeating  standard denunciations of Israeli policy toward Syria, the radio  attacked the ""weakness of certain parties and individuals"" [in  dealing with Israel] as a result of shortsightedness, limited  vision, and weakness of their pan-Arab affiliation and  understanding of the objectives which the Arab people aspire to  realize.""     Implications     Notwithstanding continuing criticism from opponents of the  government's decision to negotiate with Israel, King Husayn's  statements indicate that Jordan is prepared to pursue economic  and political gains from talks on water rights and border  demarcation, even though Husayn is probably not at this point  prepared to sign a final peace treaty with Israel independently  of the other tracks.  While the domestic opposition is not likely  to pose any substantial threat to his government, it is probably  an irritant to King Husayn, who doubtless sees his personal  credibility as a pan-Arab leader being challenged.  Nevertheless,  the newly reshuf fled cabinet has probably made the government  confident that it can manage opposition from the IAF and other  dissenting parties.     Thus far, Damascus has shown no sign of relenting in its  criticism of current Jordanian, or for that matter Palestinian,  negotiations with Israel.  For now, Syria seems likely to  maintain its rhetorical attacks while biding time in the hope  that the Israeli-Palestinian track will break down, thereby  strengthening Syria's position vis-a-vis both Israel and other  Arab parties.

In a thinly veiled swipe at opponents of the government's policy,  the column concluded that Amman ""cannot possibly be the citadel  of verbal Arab rejectionism, whose bark has, over decades, been  worse than its bite"" (21 June).     --An Al-Ra'y editorial praised the ""Jordanian Arab futuristic  view of the comprehensive peace"" that would start with border and  water talks and proceed to ""security, joint cooperation, and  other issues within the framework of the comprehensive peace.""  In a likely reference to critical articles published in the  opposition press, the editorial went on to denounce the ""media  clamor"" over Jordan's unilateral moves as unwarranted,  ""especially since Jordan has always promoted Arab solidarity and  encouraged Arab solutions to all the nation's issues"" (13 June).     Opposition Reaction     Various opposition political parties, most prominently the Muslim  Brotherhood-backed Islamic Action Front (IAF), have taken  advantage of greater press freedom brought about by the king's  cautious political liberalization to publicize a hard line  against the government's course.  They have categorically  rejected separate negotiations with Israel, accusing the  government of deserting the Palestinian cause, damaging pan-Arab  coordination, and abandoning the principle of a comprehensive  solution.  The IAF, which has 16 members in the House of  Representatives, also criticized Jordan's recent cabinet  reshuffle, which brought 10 House deputies into the cabinet as  ministers, (See Note 1) as a move aimed solely at consolidating  government support for its negotiations with Israel.     (Note 1) Apparently, the cabinet reshuffle was intended to  preempt parliamentary attacks on the government's peace process  policy.  Information Minister Jawad al-'Anani stated that the  ministerial shakeup was intended to ""consolidate cooperation  between the [executive and legislative] arms of government and  strengthen the performance of the cabinet in light of the fast  changes in the area and the peace process"" (Jordan Times, 9-10  June).     --IAF deputies in the House of Representatives issued a statement  rejecting Jordan's negotiations with the ""Zionist enemy,""  asserting that the bilateral agendas signed in Washington  ""reflect a Jordanian retreat from the constant principles"" of  ""rejecting a unilateral peace, adhering to the Islamic and Arab  character of Jerusalem, and the right of refugees to return to  their country and territories from which they were expelled by  the usurper Jews.""  The statement also warned the government  against ""making the same mistake as the Palestinian negotiator by  throwing himself into the lap of the Zionist entity"" (Al-Majd, 20  June).     --The Jordanian Arab Constitutional Front Party warned that the  government's stance ""constitutes an imminent threat to Jordan and  the Palestinian cause and harms the cooperation and coordination  between the Arab brothers in Syria and Lebanon"" (Al-Majd, 20  June).     --A joint statement issued by the IAF and the Pan-Arab Action  Front (PAAF) condemned Jordan's 8 June cabinet reshuffle as being  ""aimed at weakening the opposition in the House of  Representatives . . . in order to go ahead with plans to sign a  unilateral reconciliation agreement with the Zionist enemy.""  The  joint IAF-PAAF statement also accused the government of deviating  from its ""so-called national constants that focused on a  comprehensive solution, the return of Jerusalem, and solving the  problem of refugees"" (Al-Sabil, 21-27 June).     --A statement by the secretary of the Jordanian Arab Socialist  Ba'th Party's Supreme Command emphasized ""the need for pan-Arab  solutions to any regional issue, since solutions to any regional,  political, or economic issues will be incomplete if not discussed  and addressed within the framework of the comprehensive Arab  solution"" (Al-Ra'y, 14 June)        Syria Criticizes Israeli-Jordanian Diplomacy     Steadily escalating attacks on Jordan in Syria's tightly  controlled media illustrate Damascus' irritation over indications  of significant progress in the 6-7 June talks between Jordan and  Israel.  For example, a Damascus radio report on 22 June appeared  to launch an indirect attack on King Husayn himself.  The report  first cited optimistic statements by the king and other unnamed  Jordanian officials on the course of Israeli-Jordanian  negotiations, made during the the king's recent visit to the  United States.  The radio went on, however, to quote extensively  from what it said were Jordanian opposition statements, including  such comments as: ""the Israeli-Jordanian agenda is another step  in the political capitulationist settlement plan"" and ""the  Jordanian Government has placed the country in a dark political  tunnel.""     Following the 6-7 June talks, Syrian media initially voiced  Syria's concern without criticizing the Jordanian Government.  On  8 June, for example, the daily Tishrin harshly condemned  Jordanian journalist Fahd al-Fanik's calls in two recent columns  (Amman Al-Ra'y, 2  4 June) for Jordan to move forward in  negotiating a peace treaty with Israel.  The next day, Damascus  radio reported that Jordanian Prime Minister 'Abd-al-Salam al-  Majali had denied press reports that he had criticized Syria and  had expressed ""absolute faith"" in the ""common objectives and  destiny"" of Jordan and Syria.     Within the next several days, however, Damascus radio adopted an  openly critical tone.  On the 11th, it hinted at official  dissatisfaction, reporting that Syria had postponed a scheduled  meeting that day of the Joint Syrian-Jordanian Higher Committee-  -a body promoting bilateral cooperation--because ""both the date  and circumstances are not suitable for the Syrian side.""  By the  12th, the radio all but openly attacked Jordan.  After repeating  standard denunciations of Israeli policy toward Syria, the radio  attacked the ""weakness of certain parties and individuals"" [in  dealing with Israel] as a result of shortsightedness, limited  vision, and weakness of their pan-Arab affiliation and  understanding of the objectives which the Arab people aspire to  realize.""     Implications     Notwithstanding continuing criticism from opponents of the  government's decision to negotiate with Israel, King Husayn's  statements indicate that Jordan is prepared to pursue economic  and political gains from talks on water rights and border  demarcation, even though Husayn is probably not at this point  prepared to sign a final peace treaty with Israel independently  of the other tracks.  While the domestic opposition is not likely  to pose any substantial threat to his government, it is probably  an irritant to King Husayn, who doubtless sees his personal  credibility as a pan-Arab leader being challenged.  Nevertheless,  the newly reshuf fled cabinet has probably made the government  confident that it can manage opposition from the IAF and other  dissenting parties.     Thus far, Damascus has shown no sign of relenting in its  criticism of current Jordanian, or for that matter Palestinian,  negotiations with Israel.  For now, Syria seems likely to  maintain its rhetorical attacks while biding time in the hope  that the Israeli-Palestinian track will break down, thereby  strengthening Syria's position vis-a-vis both Israel and other  Arab parties.

0," FBIS4-51      ""cr00000024294001""        27 April 1994  FBIS  FOREIGN MEDIA NOTE--FB PN 94-057--Russia         RUSSIA:  Blitz Raises Profile in Mideast Diplomacy            RUSSIA:  Blitz Raises Profile in Mideast Diplomacy      In      the wake of the Hebron massacre and the resultant disruption  to the Arab-Israeli peace talks, the Russians launched a carefully  orchestrated diplomatic blitz with the apparent goals both of  getting Israel and the PLO to continue their negotiations and of  restoring Russia's role as a major player in Middle Eastern and  international diplomacy.  A pair of high-level foreign ministry  officials and a presidential representative shuttled to Israel and  Tunisia to bring the parties back together. Fully supporting the  PLO's request for an international presence to protect Palestinians  in the occupied territories, the Russians pressed hard for a UN  resolution, eventually adopted, condemning the massacre and calling  for an international presence.  Additionally, seeking in large part  to increase Russia's role in Middle Eastern diplomacy, the Moscow  envoys proposed convening of a second international conference in  Madrid to discuss new directions in the peace process.      After the violent murders of reportedly more than 50 Palestinians  worshipping in the al-Ibrahimi Mosque by Israeli settler Dr. Barukh  Goldstein on 25 February, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev,  First Deputy Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, and presidential envoy  Viktor Posuvalyuk were dispatched on shuttle diplomacy missions to  the Middle East at--it was pointedly noted in each case--President  Boris Yeltsin's instructions.      In announcing Ivanov's dispatch to the Middle East, the Foreign  Ministry declared Russia's support for measures to ensure the  security of Palestinians in the territories, and, in a major  initiative, called for a renewal of the Madrid conference to get the  peace process back on track.  Radio Rossii broadcast a Foreign  Ministry statement reporting that Ivanov had been sent to the Middle  East to meet with PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli leaders ""at  the personal instruction of the President of the Russian Federation""  and that ""Russia believes it necessary for the UN Security Council  to adopt an effective resolution with a view to ensuring security on  the occupied territories.  The idea of international protection for  the civilian population on the occupied territories deserves most  serious attention.""  The statement also proclaimed that ""a new  international impetus is needed for the cause of reconciliation  between Arabs and Israelis to proceed further.  A second plenary  meeting of the Madrid conference on the Middle East at the foreign  minister level could be this impetus"" (Moscow Radio Rossii Network  in Russian 1100 GMT 2 Mar 94).  Russian media reported that Ivanov  delivered a personal message to 'Arafat from Yeltsin who expressed  ""Russia's firm intention to promote the attainment of comprehensive  peace and security in the Middle East in every way.""  Upon his  return, Ivanov reported that the issues of ensuring the safety of  the Palestinian population in the occupied territories, the PLO  proposal to send international observers to the territories, and the  holding of a second Madrid conference on Middle East peace at the  foreign minister level were discussed ""during intensive talks in  both Tunisia and Israel"" (Moscow ITAR-TASS in English 0921 GMT 6 Mar  94).      Kozyrev Mission      Although Ivanov was the first diplomat to engage in shuttle  diplomacy, Kozyrev reported on 1 March that ""at the president's  instructions"" he made contact with 'Arafat and Israeli Foreign  Minister Shim'on Peres and asserted that both the PLO and Israel had  requested active Russian participation to get the negotiations back  on track.  Kozyrev stated that ""the important thing is to provide  for both sides a maximum political, and if necessary, material  assistance, if you like, so that they can not only rescue the peace  process but could also move onwards after this shock, this tragedy.  This is because we want peace to prevail in the Middle East, and we  cannot allow a bandit, or even a group of bandits, to disrupt this  process.""  Kozyrev observed that while Russia is not repudiating  cooperation with the United States, its co-sponsor in the Middle  East peace process, ""it is clear that without an active Russian  participation--both 'Arafat and the Israeli leaders have asked for  that--this process cannot be saved"" (Moscow Ostankino Television  First Channel Network in Russian 2015 GMT 1 Mar 94).      Kozyrev left for Israel and Tunisia on 11 March, bearing ""a  personal message from the Russian president on the problems of  ensuring a lasting peace in the region"" (Moscow ITAR-TASS in English  1217 GMT 10 Mar 94).  In a conversation with ITAR-TASS correspondent  Aleksandr Zhudro, Kozyrev expressed satisfaction with his discussion  with Israeli leaders and observed that ""Russia is making unorthodox  efforts for the sake of saving the peace process in this region.""  After the Hebron incident, Kozyrev said ""it was necessary to take  extraordinary measures for saving the agreements reached between  Israel and the PLO earlier.  This visit, which is aimed at  persuading the Israelis and the Palestinians to return to the  negotiations table, was one of such measures"" (Moscow ITAR-TASS  World Service in Russian 1740 GMT 11 Mar 94).      While in Tunis, Kozyrev indicated strong Russian support for the  PLO's position and optimistically predicted that talks would  promptly resume if the UN approved the resolution condemning the  massacre and providing for international protection.  Kozyrev  reported on 12 March that 'Arafat ""confirmed the PLO's firm  adherence to the peace process"" and expressed PLO commitment to  resume talks with Israel, contingent upon the adoption of the UNSC  Hebron resolution condemning the murders and calling for  international protection in the occupied territories.  Kozyrev  commented that ""the decision of the Palestinian side demanded great  political courage on the part of the PLO and of Yasir 'Arafat  personally"" (Moscow ITAR-TASS World Service in Russian 0640 GMT 12  Mar 94).  In a 12 March statement, the Russian Foreign Ministry  reiterated Kozyrev's observation about 'Arafat and welcomed the PLO  decision to resume negotiations.  In reference to the UNSC draft  resolution on Hebron, the statement made an appeal ""to all sides to  make the necessary efforts to have this resolution urgently approved  by the Security Council.  This step would clear the way for a prompt  resumption of talks aimed at concluding an agreement on Gaza and  Jericho, and on other issues on the basis of the Declaration of  Principles"" (Moscow ITAR-TASS World Service in Russian 1518 GMT 12  Mar 94).      Posuvalyuk Mission      Posuvalyuk, Yeltsin's special representative and director of the  Russian Foreign Ministry's Near East and North Africa Department,  began his  diplomacy mission on 7 March even before Kozyrev's  arrival and remained after his departure.  Posuvalyuk had a number  of meetings with 'Arafat in Tunis and reportedly delivered ""an  important message from Moscow addressed to the PLO leader and  related to Russo-Palestinian consultations held in connection with  the aggravation of the situation in the Middle East following the  al-Khalil (Hebron) massacre"" (Moscow ITAR-TASS in English 0857 GMT  14 Mar 94).      Implying that Russian diplomacy was playing a central role in  resolving the crisis, Foreign Ministry spokesman Grigoriy Karasin  reported that the PLO-Israeli agreement on continuing peace talks  and a final agreement on the Gaza Strip and Jericho had been  formulated during Posuvalyuk's contacts ""with the PLO leadership,  the Israeli delegation, and U.S. and Norwegian high-ranking  diplomats in Tunis.""  Karasin stated that Posuvalyuk conveyed a  personal message from Kozyrev to 'Arafat calling for the renewal of  peace talks and confirming Russia's intention to assist in the  implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 904, which was  approved on 18 March (Moscow INTERFAX in English 1739 GMT 22 Mar  94).      Results and Prospects      A 19 March Foreign Ministry statement hailed the adoption of UNSC  Resolution 904 and the potential for successful continuation of the  talks, attributing the success in large part to Russia's concerted  diplomatic efforts:  ""The initiating steps taken by the Russian co-  sponsor--personal address by President Boris Yeltsin to the leaders  of Israel and the PLO, a trip by the foreign minister to Israel and  Tunisia, a series of contacts by Russian special representatives in  the region and energetic efforts in the Security Council--not only  facilitated the adoption of an effective resolution, but also laid  the foundation for further progress in the Middle East peace  process"" (Moscow ITAR-TASS in English 1343 GMT 19 Mar 94).      Posuvalyuk emphasized that Russia intends to continue playing a  large role in Middle East diplomacy.  He also stressed Russia's  claim to a major role in the Mideast:  ""Russia occupies its own  ample niche in the Middle East region, to which, by virtue of its  distinctiveness, primarily historical and spiritual, no one else can  lay claim.""  He asserted that Russian diplomacy intends to play ""an  essential role"" not only in the Middle East, but also in other areas  of international turmoil, increasing its efforts to resolve conflict  situations (Moscow SEGODNYA in Russian 12 Mar 94 p 5).  In an early  April statement he also promised that ""the Middle East theme will  continue to dominate our foreign policy"" (Moscow ITAR-TASS in  English 1543 GMT 7 Apr 94).      While making clear their desire to reclaim a major role, Russian  officials have at the same time pledged to continue cooperation with  the United States.  The 12 March Foreign Ministry statement  expressed such intent:  ""Russia will continue to coordinate its own  efforts with all interested parties.  We attach special importance  to close interaction with the United States, which along with  Russia, is a co-sponsor of the Middle East peace process.""  In the 7  April ITAR-TASS report, Posuvalyuk denied that the peace process  ""has acquired some element of competitiveness with the United  States.""  Although he admitted to ""disruptions"" in the co-sponsors'  work on the peace process, he noted that ""they were not caused by  malicious intent on either side"" and that both participants ""must  act extremely carefully while looking for ways of reaching peace  between Arabs and Israelis.""  Acknowledging that the United States  and Russia pursue their separate interests in the region, Posuvalyuk  commented that ""this should not affect their efforts to help restore  peace in the Middle East"" and noted that future consultations  between Russian and American officials in Washington are intended  ""to attain a greater degree of coordination in their joint work.""     Madrid Revisited      Revival of the Madrid Conference forum is apparently one of  Moscow's strategies for enlarging its role in regional diplomacy.  Ivanov, who first raised the idea during his shuttle mission, said  that 'Arafat was immediately supportive, but Israeli Foreign  Minister Peres and U.S. Ambassador to Russia Thomas Pickering were  not.  Peres and Pickering, he said, had to be persuaded that  ""Moscow's initiative does not mean giving up the achievements and  formulas agreed upon at the Madrid Conference in October 1991, but  is an attempt to find a new approach to Middle East realities which  have changed in the past two years"" (Moscow IZVESTIYA in Russian 11  Mar 94 p 3).  Admitting that the U.S. and Israeli initial reactions  to the conference proposal were ""cool,"" Ivanov emphasized that  Russia sought to establish new objectives for ensuring continuance  of the peace process.  ""We are confident that the present  Palestinian-Israeli negotiations are close to completion and that we  need to be thinking even  today about the future.  Stage one has  been negotiated, and definite experience--both negative and  positive--has been accumulated.  We now need to meet and think about  how to further advance the peace process in all directions,"" said  Ivanov (Moscow MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI in Russian No 10, 6-13 Mar 94 p  5A).      Other Russian Foreign Ministry officials nevertheless  subsequently played down the proposal for a ""Madrid-2,"" suggesting  that convening the conference is a long-term rather than immediate  goal.  After his Vladivostok meeting with U.S. Secretary of State  Warren Christopher, Kozyrev appeared to reduce Russian emphasis on  the initiative, stating that ""Russia is no longer insisting on the  immediate holding of a second international conference on the Middle  East,"" and that ""the most important thing now was to complete work  on the implementation of the agreement on Gaza and Jericho"" (Moscow  Radiostantsiya Moskvy in Russian 1605 GMT 14 Mar 94).  However, it  appears likely that the issue may resurface in the future, since  Viktor Gogitidze, deputy director of the MFA's Near East and North  Africa Department, stated that ""Russia's call for holding another  international conference on the Middle East in Madrid remains in  force.""  Gogitidze asserted:  ""This is a long-term proposal.  The  first stage of the peace process is almost concluded.  It is  necessary to pass to the second stage, since, in addition to 'the  Palestinian direction,' there are the 'Jordanian,' 'Syrian,' and  other ones.  There is a need to work in all these directions, and  the Madrid-2 conference could play a positive role in this"" (Moscow  INTERFAX in English 1559 GMT 16 Mar 94).   (AUTHOR:  KENSKI.

Other Russian Foreign Ministry officials nevertheless  subsequently played down the proposal for a ""Madrid-2,"" suggesting  that convening the conference is a long-term rather than immediate  goal.  After his Vladivostok meeting with U.S. Secretary of State  Warren Christopher, Kozyrev appeared to reduce Russian emphasis on  the initiative, stating that ""Russia is no longer insisting on the  immediate holding of a second international conference on the Middle  East,"" and that ""the most important thing now was to complete work  on the implementation of the agreement on Gaza and Jericho"" (Moscow  Radiostantsiya Moskvy in Russian 1605 GMT 14 Mar 94).  However, it  appears likely that the issue may resurface in the future, since  Viktor Gogitidze, deputy director of the MFA's Near East and North  Africa Department, stated that ""Russia's call for holding another  international conference on the Middle East in Madrid remains in  force.""  Gogitidze asserted:  ""This is a long-term proposal.  The  first stage of the peace process is almost concluded.  It is  necessary to pass to the second stage, since, in addition to 'the  Palestinian direction,' there are the 'Jordanian,' 'Syrian,' and  other ones.  There is a need to work in all these directions, and  the Madrid-2 conference could play a positive role in this"" (Moscow  INTERFAX in English 1559 GMT 16 Mar 94).   (AUTHOR:  KENSKI.

Our president, who was addressing the press festival  yesterday, said the British Government violated international  norms by planting a secret microphone in our embassy in London.  It also raised the controversy of collaboration between Iran  and the IRA.    About two weeks ago, the British Foreign Office claimed that  its security personnel had discovered documentary evidence that  the Islamic Republic of Iran was providing funds to the IRA  through its agents and was seeking to plan to deliver weapons to  the IRA too. These claims were immediately endorsed by the  minister for Northern Ireland affairs in the House of Commons.  But not much had happened when a spokesman for Sinn Fein--the  political wing of the IRA-- refuted the British claim as a  baseless shot in the dark and unfounded propaganda, adding: To  eclipse its defeat in organizing peace talks on Ireland, the  British Government has resorted to such accusations.    Similarly, three days after the British allegations against  the Islamic Republic of Iran and following a swift and  categorical rebuttal by our officials, London's newspapers  revealed that the accusations by John Major's government were  totally unfounded and bereft of any grounds or evidence. In  this regard, THE SUNDAY TIMES, in its 1 May edition, wrote: The  British Government has no acceptable documentary evidence to  present to the court.    It thus appears that the veteran statesmen of London  resorted  to espionage and an overt violation of international laws by  planting listening devices in our embassy to pursue objectives  that were more important than their international credibility  and reputation. Many possibilities can be enumerated in an  analysis of these actions and London's desired objectives. No  one should ignore that John Major's government and the  Conservative party led by him are confronting serious problems  stemming from a dichotomy in the party. This problem is so  crucial that there is talk of the resignation of John Major's  government.    Despite the defensive action by the British Government in  leveling charges against the Islamic Republic of Iran being  nipped in the bud, and neither British officials nor the British  rumormongering newspapers presenting any plausible evidence of  Iran's support for the Irish secessionists, the British  Government strove to initiate this unfounded rumor in a  so-called preemptive move to prevent humiliation regarding its  espionage activities in the Islamic Republic of Iran's Embassy.    The British Government--by trampling international laws  underfoot--has confirmed that it attaches no importance to its  commitments to international rights and diplomatic immunity and  that when the country's interests dictate, it considers any  illegal activity justified.    As a country professing reciprocal respect for others'  rights, Britain has--by its recent acts of espionage in the  Islamic Republic of Iran's Embassy--again revealed its  interventionist and aggressive nature. The past record of  espionage is nothing new for the British echelons. They believe  that the colonial world of past centuries continues and that  Britain has the right to interfere in others' affairs and to  trample upon diplomatic immunity.    For such countries, wholesome relations based on reciprocal  interests have no meaning. What is important is getting  information and capitalizing on the amicable approach of the  other side. The issue of British spying on the Islamic Republic  of Iran's Embassy is not the first such incident. It is  certainly not the last. Every country should be vigilant, aware  that such intentions and actions might not be confined to one  embassy in Britain alone.     "

During the meeting, they reviewed relations between the two  fraternal countries, and developments in the peace process, as  well as current international issues.    The meeting was attended by the Minister of State for  Foreign  Affairs Mr. Talal al-Hasan and the Egyptian ambassador in Amman.    Mr. Musa, who arrived in Amman this morning on a brief visit  to Jordan, is also due to hold talks with his majesty the king  and other senior officials on the Middle East peace process and  several Arab and international issues, as well as bilateral  relations.    In an arrival statement, Mr. Musa said he was carrying a  message to his majesty the king from Egyptian President Husni  Mubarak dealing with the peace developments. He also said the  message deals with relations between the two brotherly  countries, and is part of their consultations and coordination,  particularly at this delicate phase of the peace process in the  region.    Asked about inter-Arab relations, the Egyptian foreign  minister said he hoped the beginning of the new year will  witness a breakthrough in inter-Arab relations. He added there  is no need to expedite efforts to restore these relations to  normal, particularly that the special circumstances which the  Arab region has recently passed through barred the improvement  of such relations.    On Israel's rejection to return to the Taba talks with the  Palestinians unless the PLO accepts the Cairo document as a  basis for these negotiations, Mr. Musa said there was more than  one paper and one document which the Israelis and Palestinians  agreed upon. He pointed out that these papers or documents  should be submitted to the leaderships concerned to approve,  reject, or amend them; and this should be the basis for  negotiations.    Mr. Musa said there is room for agreement or disagreement on  these points, or on some of them, and for reaching solutions.    The Egyptian foreign minister described the proposed meeting  between Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad and U.S. President Bill  Clinton due to be held in mid-January as an important one which  will expedite the peace process in the region.    The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Talal al-Hasan  welcomed Mr. Musa's visit to Jordan, saying it is part of the  brotherly relations between the two countries, and constitutes  an important development in the Middle East peace process. Mr.  al-Hasan said the continued coordination and consultations  between the Jordanian and Egyptian leaderships at this  particular phase is an important and vital matter.     "

The move cuts tens of thousands of Palestinians from their jobs and followed a warning by extremist Islamic groups, responsible for slaying eight Israelis in two separate attacks, that they would step up their violent activities and 'continue in the path of blood and martyrdom'. President Bill Clinton condemned the Palestinian attacks as 'acts of terrorism' aimed at stopping the Middle East peace process. The Palestine Liberation Organisation, in its first official comment said it regretted Wednesday's car bombing which left seven Israelis dead and urged Israel to implement the Israeli-Palestinian peace accord as soon as possible. Despite intense domestic pressure the government of Mr Yitzhak Rabin, prime minister, said it would continue peace talks with the PLO in Cairo on Sunday after observing the annual Holocaust memorial day and the Jewish sabbath. Israel's closure of the occupied territories was intended to calm public fears of more bloody attacks by Islamic groups seeking revenge for the February massacre of 29 Arabs by a Jewish settler in Hebron. In the southern Israeli town of Ashdod, a Palestinian guerrilla of the Islamic Jihad group, who lived in a refugee camp in the Gaza Strip, yesterday sprayed a bus stop at a busy intersection with gunfire, killing an Israeli and wounding four. Hamas called on Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza yesterday to stock up on food and supplies and prepare for 'an atmosphere of real war which will engulf the Zionist soldiers and enemy commanders in the coming days.' Hamas, which bitterly opposes the Israeli-PLO peace agreement and wants to build an Islamic state in all the historical land of Palestine, said at least four more attacks were being prepared. In Israel, right-wing opposition leaders have called for a suspension of the peace talks and the resignation of Mr Rabin.   Countries:-  ILZ  Israel, Middle East.

In an outspoken statement the king said Mr Arafat had one 'last chance' to sign an agreement on Jordan's economic role during transitional Palestinian autonomy in the occupied territories. Otherwise, he said, Jordan would move ahead with its own separate talks with Israel. Displaying frustration at being left out of discussions between the Palestinians and Israelis on limited self-rule, the king complained about Mr Arafat's constant procrastinations during talks with Jordan. 'We cannot go on saying there is co-ordination if there isn't or that there is agreement when there is none,' he said. The king's ultimatum came amid increasing Israeli dissatisfaction over the stalled Cairo autonomy talks and within the PLO itself over Mr Arafat's leadership style. Senior PLO officials met yesterday in Tunis to try to persuade their chairman to widen the decision-making process and come up with a coherent strategy for talks with Israel and Jordan. An economic agreement between Jordan and the PLO which would give Jordan's central bank wide-ranging monetary responsibilities in the occupied territories has been ready for months. But Mr Arafat has held back from endorsing it for fear of relinquishing Palestinian fiscal responsibilities to the Jordanians. Jordan has already signed a memorandum with Israel to allow banks in Jordan to reopen branches in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. And Jordan's central bank governor recently said the reopening of branches would now not depend on the economic pact with the PLO. The king also buried prospects of a Jordanian/Palestinian confederation, arguing that the idea was premature. 'I have requested that my brother (Arafat) drop the expression of confederation from his dictionary and not to discuss it in any form or manner,' he said. The PLO has been at pains to emphasis that the autonomy agreement with Israel will eventually lead to a confederation between Jordan and a Palestinian entity and joint committees had been established to discuss the issue. Relations between the PLO and Jordan have been strained since the August announcement of talks between the PLO and Israel in which Jordan played no part.   Countries:-  JOZ  Jordan, Middle East.

In a debate at the Conservative conference in Bournemouth coinciding with yesterday's ceasefire announcement Mr Mayhew made a forthright defence of the province's right to self-determination. But, watched by prime minister Mr John Major, he stopped just short of embracing grassroots calls for the government actively to persuade Ulster's people that their best future lies in the United Kingdom. Sir Patrick said: 'One undoubted fact in Northern Ireland is that most people living there want to stay within the union. That is where they think their best interests lie. And I say without hesitation we are glad of it. 'We are persuaders for the future of Northern Ireland to be decided among the people of Northern Ireland, themselves, freely and without external impediment,' he said. The 'delicacy of balance' had to be maintained if 'this province of the United Kingdom' was to achieve a less antagonistic way of life. Welcoming the loyalist ceasefire, Sir Patrick said the government would test that the 'intention of permanence' was genuine 'as we have tested the intent and sincerity of the IRA'. He added: 'If we can confirm to our satisfaction that the intention is permanent then we will explore with them the ways that the peace process can be strengthened and their views taken into account.' He made clear that the government was still not quite satisfied that the IRA had ended its campaign of violence for good. What mattered, he said, was the need to be sure they would not revert to violence rather than 'the precise language in which their intention is expressed'. Sir Patrick honoured the fortitude of the people of Northern Ireland in the face of terrorism, republican and loyalist. He condemned the terrorists' 'sickening, random crimes' and said of the horrific aftermath of outrages: 'The blood congeals and lies like pools of black treacle on the floor.' Sir Patrick and Mr Major were greeted enthusiastically by representatives in spite of the leadership's decision not to allow a vote on an amendment urging the government to be a persuader for the union. Mr Leonard Fee, chairman of the Conservative Northern Ireland Area Council and the senior unpaid Tory in the province, said 1,100 people had signed a petition urging the amendment to be called. He said: 'If we start down the devolution slope I believe within a fairly short period of time our nation will be in tatters.' Ms Dorothy Dunlop, a former Belfast city councillor, implicitly criticised Baroness Thatcher, the former prime minister, by saying that the government should have called a referendum after signing the Anglo-Irish Agreement in 1985. 'If we had had a referendum then, we would have been spared much of the loyalist violence whose end we are celebrating today,' she said. She believed Mr Major would not have entered into the agreement had he been prime minister in 1985.   Countries:-  IEZ  Ireland, EC.     GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Although we realize that the illegitimate son that is the  product of Western states' relations with Jewish leaders, the  birth of Israel, will continue to be the object of Western care  and attention, new talk about the peace required in our region  dictates striking a balance -- which does not yet exist --  between the special relations the West is establishing with  Israel and the new relations the West hopes to establish with  the Arabs, who call for justice, restoration of usurped rights,  and compensation at a stage when durable peace can be concluded.    The French minister's talk about reactivating military and  security cooperation between Paris and Tel Aviv, after crossing  the river from a recent visit to Amman, is surprising. We  question the timing and aims of this reactivation, especially  since France was neutral rather than supportive of Israeli  aggression and the acts of persecution and oppression practiced  under occupation.    During the current peace talks Tel Aviv has presented  nothing, on any track, that proves it is ready to abandon the  logic of occupation and aggression. It continues daily  violations of the simplest human rights in Palestine and the  occupied Arab territories. Still, the French minister talks  about more cooperation with Israel in various fields amid  reports that the French defense minister will shortly arrive in  Tel Aviv to bolster military cooperation that was severed in  1967.    We hope the French interest in reactivating relations with  Tel Aviv will not place more hurdles on the path of the peace  process -- a process further complicated and slowed down by the  unlimited U.S. support for this entity. Israel will be  reassured that this economic, political, and military aid will  continue, even if it perpetuates the state of war and  instability in this sensitive region by its obstruction of the  peace talks. Development and construction energies in this  region have been exhausted over the past decades as a result of  the losses caused by the establishment of Israel.     "

As London and Dublin struggled to stop their peace initiative being blown off track by last week's mortar attacks at London's Heathrow airport, officials promised new talks on security co-operation between the two governments as a matter of urgency. Downing Street - responding to fresh IRA demands for direct talks between London and republican leaders - said it was a 'fundamental principle' of December's joint declaration that there would be no negotiations with Sinn Fein in advance of an end to IRA violence. That principle was not going to change. It was 'deeply offensive' to people in Britain and Ireland that the IRA should claim to be interested in peace while continuing to kill people in cold blood and to prosecute its campaign of terror. However, Downing Street's choice of words appeared to leave the door open for a possible resumption of messages between London and republican leaders. When last year's secret contacts were exposed in November, Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, said the messages had not amounted to negotiating with terrorists. The president of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, yesterday continued his efforts to wrong-foot the government, saying that Sinn Fein had 'no great concern' to be engaged in bilateral discussions with London on constitutional matters. Repeating his call for clarification, Mr Gerry Adams welcomed the first official IRA response to the Downing Street declaration on Sunday, describing it as a 'positive reiteration' of the IRA's commitment to reaching a negotiated peace deal. Mr John Hume, leader of the mainly Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party, said that London should launch new talks with Sinn Fein. He insisted that the IRA did not intend to detonate any of the mortar bombs which were fired into Heathrow in three separate attacks. Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, said the attacks on Heathrow were 'a gross miscalculation by the IRA' which was not going to advance the peace process. Mr John Major is expected to be pressed to tighten security in meetings with the leaders of the two main unionist parties this week. The Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the hard-line Democratic Unionists, said yesterday that the prime minister had not got 'the guts or spine or ability' to stand up to Dublin.

In an editorial in Sunday's issue, AL-AHRAM says that the  Syrian-U.S. summit coincides with Washington's statement that it  is holding contacts with all the Arab parties and Israel for  resumption of the bilateral negotiations in the U.S. capital and  to reach agreement on a specific date for this purpose.    The paper adds: The summit is even more significant because  it will be followed three days later by the visit of Jordan's  King Husayn's to Washington for a meeting with the U.S.  President amid signs that a Jordanian-Israeli agreement is in  the offing.    AL-AHRAM notes that promoting the Syrian-Israeli  negotiations  will also give impetus to the Lebanese-Israeli talks and  encourage Palestinian and Israeli negotiators to seek the prompt  implementation of autonomy in Gaza and Jericho.    AL-AKHBAR's editorial says the al-Asad-Clinton summit is an  attempt to overcome the obstacles to the Syrian-Israeli talks on  peace in the Middle East. It notes that Israeli Prime Minister  Yitzhaq Rabin has retreated from his earlier position that his  country is willing to withdraw from the Golan Heights.    The paper adds: It was understood right from the beginning  of the Arab-Israeli negotiations in Madrid in 1991 that Israel  agreed that these negotiations would be conducted in line with  UN Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, which call for  withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories.    AL-AKHBAR says this is the solution that can guarantee a  real  and lasting peace between the Jewish state and the Arab  countries in the region.    The paper urges Rabin and his colleagues to think again  about  the kind of peace that can be attained if Palestinian, Syrian,  and Lebanese territories remain under Israeli control.     "

""I remain convinced that the IRA is willing to deal  positively with any new eventuality. It is clear that the IRA  is interested in developing the search for peace,"" he told a St  Patrick's Day gathering in west Belfast.    What was required was a change in government policy.  ""Building peace may be messy and continually tragic and  confused. It may be slow and circuitous,"" he said in an  apparent reference to IRA mortar attacks on Heathrow and the  murder of a RUC (Royal Ulster Constabulary) officer last week.    Identifying the source of all the violence as the continuing  Anglo-Irish conflict, Mr Adams said it was the Government which  held the key to progress. It was time for the realism displayed  during the negotiations over Britain's disengagement from  Zimbabwe ""to be shown again in relation to their longterm  intentions in Ireland.""    He had no doubt that the opportunity for peace remained.  ""For  all of us the prospect is at the same time exciting and  frightening. It's a very dangerous time in our history."" Making  peace with one's enemies and opponents was a very difficult  business. ""We must expect set-backs, disappointments and  diversions, but we are determined that when and if these arise  we will overcome them.""    Mr Adams struck a significantly softer tone than in his  keynote speech at Sinn Fein's annual conference last month, when  he called Northern Ireland's Unionist majority an Irish national  minority. Partition had no longer failed, but had retarded, the  development of democracy in Ireland.    ""It is my firm conviction that Unionists can be persuaded to  recognise that they share a common peaceful destiny with their  fellow countrymen and women in the common territory of Ireland,""  he said. It was obvious that the Government's role as persuader  was key to this. But, ""we in Sinn Fein, who profess to be  anti-sectarian and secular, have a duty to develop our contacts  with the Unionist community. We must reconise, be sympathetic  and sensitive to what Unionists are being asked to consider and  commit themselves to, if a peace dialogue is to develop.    ``I am calling on nationalists and republicans to be aware  of  what it means to be a Unionist as this century draws to a  close.'' There was also a need for Unionists to seek  clariflcation of the Government's longterm intentions in  Ireland. It was ironic that Unionists and nationalists shared a  common distrust of the Government.    The remarks may have been directed at U.S. opinion, which  appears to be hardening against the IRA as Albert Reynolds, the  Irish leader, visits Washington seeking support for the Downing  Street Declaration.    House of Representatives Speaker Tom Foley, a leading  Irish-American politician, conceded that the United States had  been wrong to grant Mr Adams a visa this year.    In the Commons Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Ulster Secretary  said:  ""The best hope for peace is that Sinn Fein realise that violence  is going to get them nowhere.""    Sir Patrick, during Northern Ireland questions, came under  pressure from his own backbenchers for a security crackdown, and  from the Ulster Unionist leader James Molyneaux to shelve  discussions on possible cross-border institutions during the  present round of bilateral talks with the constitutional  parties. Mr Molyneaux said the parties should instead  concentrate on agreeing a devolved assembly in Northern Ireland.    David Trimble, Ulster Unionist MP for Upper Bann, told Sir  Patrick to stop using the Downing Street Declaration as an  excuse for failing to press ahead with talks on devolved  government for Northern Ireland.    Although Sir Patrick said he would not uncouple the socalled  Strand One talks on devolution from the other two Strands  (cross-border institutions and relations between the two  governments) Ulster Unionists are privately hopeful that in  practice the current round of talks will be restricted to Strand  One.    Members of the Northern Ireland backbench committee are to  visit the RUC shortly to study the problem of co-operation with  the Garda over border security.     "

Are you still insisting on not  participating in the talks?    [Buwayz] Not only are we still insisting but we are also  more  convinced than ever before that it was premature to embark on  multilateral negotiations before the bilateral negotiations made  tangible, essential, and decisive progress. We are insisting  that participation in them is a mistake. Lebanon was the first  country that warned against joining the multilateral talks. I  remember that I made this warning when I chaired the Arab League  Council meeting in Cairo in 1990 before the Madrid conference.  I said then that we are reading in the press and hearing from  some sources that multilateral talks are being proposed on the  issues of water, armaments, the environment, transportation,  communications, etc. I also said: While firmly convinced that  these are essential issues, that we cannot be forgiven if we  ignore them, that these issues have to be discussed when peace  comes, and that an agreement must be reached on them because  they are common problems, we cannot embark on discussing these  issues if they are proposed to us--and at that time they were  not officially proposed--before we are certain that peace is  coming and on the details of this peace.    Why? First, because I regarded the multilateral talks as  complementary to peace and to the peace decision. How can we  complement a decision that has not been made yet?    Second, I said that these multilateral talks are like  someone  who tries to furnish a house before it is built or the shape is  known. How can we choose the furniture for a house that has not  been built?    This is why I say that the multilateral talks involve  complementary issues that presuppose the existence of peace. We  must be certain that the peace decision has become inevitable  and that its aspects and shape have become clear before we enter  into multilateral talks. We have no reservations about the  issues being discussed at the multilateral talks but about the  mechanism. We even welcome international participation in them.  But we have reservations about their timing. We say it  openly--and time has proved that we are right--that the  multilateral talks have not made progress because the bilateral  ones have not made progress. Those who have been tempted to  take part in these talks admitted to us later that they were  tempted by the promises made from outside the multilateral talks  framework. Some Arab countries have admitted to me later that  they joined the multilateral talks not out of conviction but on  the basis of foreign promises to improve their relations with a  certain country. Where have the multilateral talks gone now?    The question is how could the negotiator sitting at the  multilateral talks table make progress when he knows that the  principal negotiator involved in the bilateral talks is stalled?    [AL-SAFIR] It appears that the dead end is a dual one?    [Buwayz] In addition to what I have already said, the most  important consideration for us is that the multilateral talks  must be in the interest of everyone in the region. For Israel  it is of an additional interest. How can we pay a price to  Israel when the latter has not yet agreed to implement the  Madrid agreement principles and the international resolutions  that were supposedly used by the Madrid conference as a basis  for shaping the implementation mechanism?    [AL-SAFIR] Israel alone is not responsible for the dead end  in the talks but is jointly responsible for it with the United  States, which is managing the negotiating process?    [Buwayz] Like in criminal law where there is a positive and  a  negative responsibility, I believe that Israel is responsible  for not abiding by the Madrid agreement and for not seeking to  implement the Madrid decisions. It is prevaricating on  implementing what was decided on in that conference. It tried  to prevaricate when it sought to gain six additional months  during the U.S. elections and when it procrastinated with all  the Arab countries as it was working to push the Palestinian  negotiator into certain positions while refusing to make  progress on the other tracks. Between the policy of isolating  the other parties, the policy of the Israeli Governments'  internal weakness, and the policy of wagering on the change in  U.S. Administrations, Israel has squandered much of the years  since the peace process started. I say that this is a positive  responsibility, that is, it practiced this responsibility  intentionally and negatively. That was a positive  responsibility done to serve a negative objective.    Regarding U.S. responsibility as cosponsor of the  conference, we did not enter the peace process believing Israel  really wanted peace and would quickly embrace it. We did not  enter an ambiguous peace process either; we entered a process  with well-defined features, goals, mechanisms, and roles. The  goals were clear and frank. They were represented by the  principle of land for peace, the principle of the implementation  of UN resolutions, and the principle of the restoration of lands  and the Palestinian people's political rights. A major reason  for our participation in the conference was our belief that the  U.S. role would be an influential one. We believed that Israel  on its own would not move toward peace. We took into  consideration the U.S. and Soviet assurances. The Soviet Union  still existed then. We particularly depended on the U.S.  assurances, believing that the U.S. commitment to this  conference would result in pressure being applied on Israel to  move in the required direction.    I cannot say that the successive U.S. Administrations have  fully played this role. I cannot say that the United States has  played this role from the beginning, that is, the role of an  honest broker or a driving force. I believe that the United  States has so far sufficed itself with playing a role of a  logistical nature or that of a technical broker. It has not  undertaken dynamic and strong mediation as envisaged in the  peace process. Hence, its responsibility is negative, the  responsibility of someone who has not fulfilled his obligations.    [AL-SAFIR] Israel claims that the Lebanese delegation is not  negotiating with it. At the same time, Rabin stresses that  there is no full withdrawal from the Golan in return for a full  peace. How can this vicious circle be broken?    [Buwayz] This question consists of two parts. Regarding the  negotiations with the Lebanese delegation, what do they want the  Lebanese delegation to negotiate? There are certain Lebanese  principles. Lebanon clearly says that Israel must implement  Resolution 425, which calls for Israel's withdrawal to the  internationally recognized border, and for the Lebanese state to  establish its authority. In return, Lebanon pledges to assume  its responsibility as a state and to ensure that security and  stability prevails in the area that the state will receive. We  tell the Israelis that this resolution is independent of the  Middle East conflict. Let them accept the principle of its  implementation and we will then be ready to form a joint  military commission that will adopt the executive steps,  programs, and timetables. Afterwards, in solidarity with the  other Arab states, we will move forward with the peace talks  until a comprehensive and final peace is achieved.    We have proposed progress in two phases. The first phase is  purely Lebanese and is through the implementation of Resolution  425. The second phase is on the regional level. What did Israel  do? It linked the Lebanese dossier with the other dossiers,  especially the Syrian dossier. First, as a precondition Israel  demanded that the Lebanese state control the resistance when it  knew that this was impossible. Israel knows that the resistance  is the result and not the cause of the occupation. The result  cannot disappear as long as the cause remains. Israel knows  that the Lebanese Government cannot drop the principle of  resistance as long as it does not have definite assurances that  its territory will be restored. Therefore, Israel is imposing  impossible conditions while we have pledged to establish peace  and security when Israel withdraws from the south. Second,  Israel links its withdrawal to the signing of a comprehensive  peace treaty under which all Arab rights are supposed to be  restored. Hence, it is Israel that is linking the problem of  the south with the regional problem. This is not the first  time it has done this. In the 17 May [1983] agreement, which  was signed after one and a half years of talks, Israel linked  the outcome of the talks with Syria's commitment to the security  of the south. Therefore, if Israel is accusing us of linking our  dossier to Syria's dossier, it is doing that itself. If it is  accusing us of linking it to the regional problem, it is also  doing that itself.    [AL-SAFIR] In the beginning you stated that Israel is  seeking  to deal unilaterally with the Arab states. Now you are saying  that it is linking the Lebanese dossier with the Syrian dossier.    [Buwayz] In the Lebanese dossier, instead of accepting the  spirit of Resolution 425 and acknowledging the need for the  implementation of this resolution in return for security and  stability and then moving on to the regional level, Israel is  linking this subject with the regional topic. One of Israel's  conditions for withdrawal is the signing of a comprehensive  peace agreement.    [AL-SAFIR] The Madrid conference was launched on the basis  of land for peace. The Lebanese translation of the conference  is the implementation of Resolution 425 in return for what?    [Buwayz] Well, we have told Israel to please declare its  readiness for complete withdrawal. This would justify forming a  military committee, which would work out a timetable for a  withdrawal and then we could proceed together toward a  comprehensive peace. However, Israel is proposing forming a  military committee with an as yet unidentified purpose. We have  asked Israel about the purpose of a military committee. If the  purpose is to maintain the prevailing truce, then we say that  there is a truce committee, so why this new committee? If the  goal is to maintain the current situation, we say that there are  UN forces doing that. Let us do their job. However, if the  purpose is really to reach a full withdrawal from south Lebanon,  then let Israel declare this and there would be justification  for forming a military committee.    [AL-SAFIR] We are currently in a dormant stage that may last  for a long time. Can Lebanon tolerate such a situation?    [Buwayz] For us to say whether this situation will continue  or not we have to pinpoint responsibility for it. It was very  obvious in the latest round of talks, the 12th round, that  Israel deliberately refused to make any progress for three  reasons:    1. It wanted to frustrate all results of the Geneva summit  between Presidents al-Asad and Clinton to negate any possibility  of an Arab-U.S. agreement that might be imposed on it and to  show that nothing positive can be done without taking the  Israeli factor into account.    2. It believed that it could not make progress on a track as  long as the Palestinian track had not run its course, so Israel  deliberately prevaricated to foil this round in the hopes of  reaching certain agreements with the Palestinians.    3. It used the pretext that the government's internal  situation at the time did not allow it to make certain decisions  and that it had to secure certain domestic alliances before  making new decisions. Israel used these three reasons directly  or tacitly to prevent any progress. So, who is responsible for  the stagnation in the negotiations?    [AL-SAFIR] There is no doubt that Israel is responsible, but  the Arab party has no other option than negotiations.    [Buwayz] I would not say that the Arab side has no other  options, but that the Arab side is trying to give the peace  process every chance. I would also like to maintain that the  Arab side refuses to bear the responsibility for the failure of  the peace process, should it fail. Therefore, despite the  difficult negotiations and Israeli stalling, the Arab side wants  to ensure all chances for these negotiations to succeed. Should  the negotiations fail, the Arab side does not want to look  negative before the world. If a party does not mind looking  negative and bearing the moral and political responsibility for  the peace process, let it be Israel. [passage omitted]    [AL-SAFIR] One of the issues that shows the extent of Arab  solidarity is that of the Palestinian refugees in the Arab  countries, which is being discussed at the multilateral talks.  For example, Jordan, which you said will not sign, said that it  will resort to international law and not Resolution 194, which  provides for the return of refugees to their land. What about  the Palestinian refugees in Lebanon and how will you deal with  this issue?    [Buwayz] When Jordan chooses a certain legal or any other  framework to deal with the Palestinian refugee problem, it means  the problem of Palestinians on its territory and not elsewhere.  Regarding Lebanon, we believe that there can be no possible  solution to the Palestinian refugee problem in the context of  the multilateral negotiations outside the bilateral talks.  Regarding the Palestinian presence in Lebanon, we are  proceeding from the points outlined in our Constitution: We  reject settling the Palestinians in Lebanon in any way, and all  Lebanese concur on this issue. We believe that there is no one  radical solution to the Palestinian refugee problem. Anyone who  believes that there is one prompt solution is mistaken. I  believe that solving this problem must follow four lines:  First, recognizing the right to return and consolidating the UN  resolution on the right to return. What do I mean by the right  to return? Of course, Israel will not agree to the Palestinians  returning to the territories that will remain under its  authority. But what about Israel's stance on the return of  Palestinians to the territories that will be regained--Gaza and  Jericho--and to more areas that may be regained later? The  right to return to the Palestinian territories that will be  under Palestinian authority in the future must be entrenched,  particularly those Palestinians who have connections there such  as material, property, or relatives. I believe that if we work  seriously to emphasize this principle, some 20 percent of  Palestinian citizens in Lebanon could be assimilated there.    Second is the principle of the family reunion return. The  world has the humanitarian responsibility to allow those who  have family members anywhere in the world--whether it is Egypt,  Syria, Jordan, the Gulf, Palestine, Canada, or the United  States--to join their families, that is, family reunion by  having the minority join the majority. If we can shape this  idea and adopt it, it can solve 25 percent of the problems of  the Palestinians in Lebanon.    Third, I believe that there are countries with many  immigrants. There are countries that are large and rich but  suffer from the weakness of their human resources and low  populations. These countries have let in a number of  expatriates. They include Australia, Canada, and possibly the  United States. I believe that these countries that continue to  accept a large number of immigrants should give priority to the  Palestinians who want to settle in them.    And last, I believe that the Middle East region is also a  very extensive area. Some of its areas have huge resources and  need manpower and certain human resources. I also believe that  some of these countries have the moral, political, and ethnic  responsibility of tackling even the problem of the Palestinian  refugees. How can we continue to import Asian laborers when we  have Palestinians who cannot enter and work in these countries?    Hence, I believe that if we deal seriously with these four  solutions, they can solve a major and radical part of Lebanon's  problem with the Palestinian presence. While this presence  might be normal, acceptable, and ""easily digested"" in other  countries of immense size and huge population and where the  absorption of 400,000 or 500,000 Palestinians will not affect  them, this presence in Lebanon will have deep and fundamental  consequences. First, Lebanon's geographic size is very small  compared to its population. Second, the Lebanese area that can  be inhabited or is fit for investment--if we take away the high  mountains and deep valleys-- remains very small. Third,  everyone knows that the Lebanese structure is a very complicated  one and any imbalance in it will have political social,  economic, and security consequences. Fourth, we believe that  the conditions of the Palestinians in the refugee camps in  Lebanon radically differs from those in a number of countries  where they have settled down, are working, and are enjoying  health care and education. It is impossible to ask Lebanon at  present, when it has emerged from war and is incapable of  satisfying the social needs of the Lebanese, to take care of the  Palestinians' needs, too.    [AL-SAFIR] But the state has banned the rebuilding of the  camps from the United Nations Relief and Works Agency funds and  not from Lebanon's funds. What exactly is going on? What is  being planned for the camps?    [Buwayz] If this were allowed, you would have said that  resettlement is already taking place. What is required here to  keep the Palestinian issue alive and keep it the responsibility  of everyone or to absorb and resolve it here in Lebanon? I  believe it is impossible to reconcile these two notions. If you  want to allow the Palestinians to build wherever they want and  if you want them to be included in social security and to enjoy  all the rights of Lebanese citizens, then I believe that you are  moving, intentionally or unintentionally, toward bringing  resettlement about.    [AL-SAFIR] Mr. Minister, it is clear that Israel will not  allow the Palestinians back and is raising the issue of the Jews  in Arab countries.    [Buwayz] I don't think that the problem lies with Israel  only. I don't believe that there are Palestinians who want to  live in the State of Israel. This issue is not under discussion  in the first place. We are talking about the Palestinians'  return to the territories that will be retrieved and placed  under Palestinian authority.    [AL-SAFIR] Your words imply that Lebanon does not want to  keep the Palestinians already here and will work to reduce their  numbers because, as you just said, it cannot tolerate such a  number.    [Buwayz] I am not saying that Lebanon cannot tolerate that  number now because this implies that it could tolerate that in  the past. I am saying that Lebanon has never tolerated such a  number and cannot tolerate it. We do not accept or allow a  solution to the Palestinian problem to be made at the expense of  creating a Lebanese problem. We also do not want or accept the  exchange of the Palestinian identity for another one, including  a Lebanese identity.    [AL-SAFIR] But Lebanon has shouldered responsibility for  some of the Palestinians and must continue to do so at least  temporarily.    [Buwayz] Lebanon and other Arab countries have temporarily  received a number of Palestinians until solutions are found.  The solutions have not been forthcoming. Does this mean that  Lebanon must shoulder the responsibility alone for these  Palestinians? This is an international responsibility resulting  from the creation of Israel at the expense of the Palestinians,  and an Arab responsibility from the perspective of blood and  brotherly ties. Accordingly, this subject concerns the host  states.    [AL-SAFIR] In any case, we retain our viewpoint regarding  what you are saying.    [Buwayz] What is the problem?    [AL-SAFIR] Matters might not be explained only on the basis  of the options you have spoken about. There is a problem.    [Buwayz] You have convinced me that there is a problem. Has  anybody said there is no problem? If this problem did not  exist, you would not have asked me all these questions. I agree  with you that there is a problem. You have asked me how it can  be solved. I have given you the realistic and possible  solutions for this problem.    [AL-SAFIR] Are the ideas that you have aired personal or  part of arrangements being prepared for the region?    [Buwayz] They are a kind of evaluation of the approaches  that we can adopt. We have discussed this topic with  international and other quarters. These quarters are now  discussing this topic.    [AL-SAFIR] Do these ideas apply to Syria, Jordan, and Egypt?    [Buwayz] No, this solution applies to Lebanon. Perhaps the  Palestinians in Egypt are not facing a problem. Egypt, with a  population of 60 million, might not have a problem in  assimilating 500,000 Palestinians. Syria does not have a  problem with large refugee camps. The Palestinians in Syria  benefit from free medicine and education. They enjoy almost all  rights, except political rights.    I have explained Lebanon's special character. It is a small  country with a sensitive social structure.    [AL-SAFIR] If the Palestinians refuse to leave Lebanon, will  they be forced to leave?    [Buwayz] The Palestinians have so far proved their adherence  to their identity. I believe a large number of Palestinians  want either to return to Palestine or to go to another country  where the conditions for living and working are better. I  believe the opening of these options does not conflict with the  Palestinian people's rights to return, to family reunions, or to  choose the country in which they want to live.    [AL-SAFIR] Is there a possibility of discussing other  options  for the Palestinians in Lebanon that will provide better  conditions for them?    [Buwayz] Under no circumstances will Lebanon accept the  naturalization of the Palestinians.    [AL-SAFIR] We did not mean naturalization.    [Buwayz] Lebanon may accept gradual solutions. The  residence of some Palestinians might be organized in accordance  with solutions that will require some time. However, there is a  firm national principle. Lebanon cannot assimilate the  Palestinians and melt them into the Lebanese identity.     "

The ministers met near the Irish Republic's County Cavan  border with Ulster after the opening of a restored waterway link  between the republic and the north.    But before talks were under way, fresh violence in Belfast  brought security issues back to the top of the agenda.    IRA gunmen killed a former regular Army soldier from the  Shankill Road as he worked as a security guard near the city  centre. Loyalists bombed a Sinn Fein office at Belfast City Hall  injuring two workmen and a soldier was hurt in a blast at the  Fort George Army base in Londonderry.    At the weekend in Dublin, the Loyalist Ulster Volunteer  Force  paramilitary organisation attacked a city centre pub being used  by Sinn Fein for a fundraising event.    The ministers had planned to concentrate on political  questions following Britain's response last week to a series of  questions about the Downing Street peace declaration posed by  Sinn Fein.    Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew and deputy  Irish premier and foreign minister Dick Spring later said they  pledged to maintain the current ""highest ever level"" of  cross-border security co-operation to combat the terrorists.    Sir Patrick said what had happened in Dublin had  demonstrated  the problem of terrorism was one that had to be faced by the  security forces on both sides of the border. ""The highest  degree of co-operation will be maintained between us,"" he said.    Irish Justice Minister Maire Geoghegan-Quinn, who was also  at  the talks, said she would be presenting a report to cabinet  colleagues in Dublin tomorrow on the weekend shooting and  bombing attempt. She will meet Irish Police Commissioner Patrick  Culligan tomorrow to review security precautions being applied  in Dublin and border areas to counter loyalist raids.    On the political front Sir Patrick said he had noted and was  grateful for the ""very positive Irish government response"" to  Britain's statement last week following Sinn Fein's request for  clarification of the peace document.    Prime Minister John Major and Irish premier Albert Reynolds  are to meet in London later this week to assess the development  of their peace initiative.    Sir Patrick said: ""Both governments stand shoulder to  shoulder in this respect and in their attitude to Sinn Fein and  the IRA and the use of violence for political purposes.""    Also at today's discussions was Northern Ireland Office  junior minister Michael Ancram who has been involved in  behind-the-scenes talks with political leaders in Belfast in a  bid to force a restart of the stalled inter-party talks process  on the future of the province.    Mr Spring reported that a considerable amount of work had  been done towards establishing a framework for fresh talks but  further progress had still to be made.    Security measures in and around the border area fringed by  the Irish Republic's County Cavan and Northern Ireland's County  Fermanagh was intense from daybreak for the top-level  get-together.    Sir Patrick and Mr Spring jointly declared open a canal  connecting Northern Ireland's Lough Erne and the River Shannon  on the southern side of the border. The canal first opened 125  years ago but closed soon afterwards as a nautical flop. It has  been restored at a cost of 30 million pounds in a project funded  partly by European Union funds and backed by both the British  and Irish governments.     "
0,FT934-3037 ,"FT934-3037 _AN-DLJDZAEOFT 931210   FT  10 DEC 93 / Clinton and Assad to meet as Syria-Israel talks resume      By MARK NICHOLSON and JULIAN OZANNE      CAIRO, JERUSALEM   Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, yesterday announced Syria's formal return to direct peace talks with Israel and said President Bill Clinton would meet President Hafez al-Assad, the Syrian leader, early next year in Geneva. Syria has for three months refused to resume bilateral talks without a prior Israeli undertaking to withdraw fully from the Golan Heights, captured in the 1967 war. The last round of bilateral talks, the 11th, took place in September. At a press conference in Damascus, Mr Christopher declined to reveal what undertakings Syria had been offered, saying any revelations might hurt progress in the negotiations. Mr Clinton is expected to meet Mr Assad in Geneva after January 15, adding a stop to a European tour already embracing Brussels, Prague, Moscow and Minsk. It will be the first meeting of US and Syrian leaders since Mr George Bush met Mr Assad in November 1990 during efforts to create the multinational coalition which ejected Iraqi forces from Kuwait. Mr Farouk al-Sharaa, Syria's foreign minister, said the summit would 'help to push the peace process forward', adding: 'Such a meeting is so important  -I think it would produce results.' The summit will mark a significant opportunity for Syria to press for the lifting of the economic sanctions imposed because the US and other western nations consider it to be a state sponsor of terrorism. However, Mr Christopher said that nothing had changed in the US assessment of Syria either in this regard or in respect of its human rights record. Mr Christopher also announced that Lebanese and Syrian heads of delegation had agreed to meet in Washington on January 18 to discuss a full resumption of peace talks with Israel, either at the end of the month or early in February. Mr Christopher said he was confident that such agreement would follow. The fruitful climax to Mr Christopher's latest Middle East shuttle came as Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO chairman, and Mr Shimon Peres, Israel's foreign minister, met in Spain in an attempt to inject momentum into their own stalled negotiations. They restated their hope that Israeli forces could start withdrawing from Gaza and Jericho on schedule next Monday. However, Mr Nabil Shaath, head of the Palestinian negotiating team with Israel, said in Cairo that 'major differences' remained. Mr Arafat and Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, are to meet in Cairo on Sunday in an attempt to bridge outstanding differences. The urgency of meeting Monday's deadline was underlined by continuing violence in the occupied territories. US tempts Syria, Page 4   Countries:-  SYZ  Syria, Middle East.

0,FT931-7363 ,"FT931-7363 _AN-DBYB6AANFT 930225   FT  25 FEB 93 / Air-drops to land in a political minefield      By ROBERT MAUTHNER, Diplomatic Editor, and MICHAEL LITTLEJOHNS At The UN   WHATEVER the humanit-arian motives behind the US decision to parachute relief supplies into east-Bosnia Moslem enclaves, such an operation entails some very real political, and military, risks. Although the US administration has indicated that it would also be dropping supplies to isolated Serb and Croat communities in Bosnia, the general perception that Washington is concerned mainly to help the Moslems is unlikely to help the peace process. That process, under the chairmanship of Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, is already in dire trouble following the failure of the leaders of two of the three warring factions to participate in face-to-face talks in New York for the past three weeks. However, Mr Cyrus Vance, the UN mediator, was more optimistic yesterday when he said the talks could be resumed 'no later than Monday'. The refusal of Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, to return to New York as promised has been attributed to concern about his security following the UN Security Council's decision to set up a war crimes court and the actions filed against him by three US human rights organisations. This, however, seems to be only part of the story. His reluctance is almost certainly motivated, too, by the realisation that US participation in the peace talks can only increase the pressure on him to make compromises. Despite this, reports from the UN last night said that Mr Karadzic was expected to return to New York by the weekend. Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic has also failed to turn up in New York, or in Washington where he was due to meet Mr Al Gore, the US vice-president, two days ago. The Bosnian leader, whose UN delegate said yesterday was 'definitely committed' to come, has made no attempt to hide his disappointment with Washington's policy stance. It was an open secret that President Izetbegovic and Mr Haris Silajdzic, his foreign minister, hoped the US would announce military intervention on their behalf. Instead, President Bill Clinton did little more than announce US participation in a peace process already underway. All the signs are that the Bosnian government, while welcoming the US decision to parachute relief supplies, is still hoping the air-drops will merely be the first step towards military intervention against the Bosnian Serbs. The risk is that the Moslems may try to bring this about by firing at the US transport aircraft and making it look as if the Bosnian Serbs are responsible for the attacks. Threatening noises from the Serbian side have also underlined the risk of an escalation of the conflict, even though Washington said yesterday that combat aircraft would not be used to escort air-drops. If the US operation is no more than a 'one-off' action, and is carried out without incident, it could possibly help the long-term peace process. It would answer the Bosnian government's complaint that the international community is not doing enough to alleviate the Moslems' suffering and would thus deprive it of a pretext for not attending the peace talks. For the moment, however, the mutual suspicions and recriminations that the intended air-drop has aroused have merely complicated a peace process which was already in the doldrums.

The EU stressed that efforts in this regard, from the Madrid  conference, through the Israeli-Palestinian Declaration of  Principles signed on 13 September, to the signing of the  Gaza-Jericho Agreement in Cairo on 4 May, owe much to Egypt's  constructive and positive contribution and reflect Egypt's  consistent and principled policy.    This came in a joint statement issued after the ninth  meeting  of the Egyptian-European Cooperation Council held in Brussels  today and chaired by Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa and Greek  Alternate Foreign Affairs Minister Theodhoros Pangalos, whose  country chairs the EU Council.    The statement said that today's meeting allowed the two  sides  to take stock of their relations within the framework of their  cooperation agreement. It also provided a chance to discuss  political issues of mutual concern.    The EU saluted Egypt's pioneering role in achieving peace in  the Middle East, describing that role as a strong factor  creating stability and balance in the region.    The two sides recalled the joint action of the EU foreign  ministers on 19 April to support the Middle East peace process  and mobilize the EU's political, economic, and financial  resources to achieve a just and comprehensive settlement in the  Middle East.    The two sides highlighted their joint efforts to help  achieve  greater success in the negotiations between Israel and the PLO  and make progress on the other bilateral negotiating tracks  involving Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan on the basis of the  relevant UN Security Council resolutions and the principles of  the Madrid conference, including the exchange of land for peace.    The statement said the role of both sides in the  multilateral  talks emphasizes the commitment of Egypt and the EU to play an  active and constructive role in the peace process.    The two sides agreed on the need for a more active role by  the committees of the multilateral talks.    The two sides stressed that making progress on all the  bilateral and multilateral tracks of the Middle East peace  negotiations will achieve development and regional cooperation  in the region, from which both sides will benefit.    The two sides noted the need for peace and security in the  Mediterranean region. The statement said the two sides aspire  to rapid efforts to achieve these common interests out of their  belief that this would help create regional peace and security.    Within the framework of bilateral cooperation, the EU noted  with great interest that Egypt is firmly committed to continuing  to implement the economic reform program.    The joint statement said the private investment sector and  the export sector represent the basic factor in the success of  the Egyptian economic reform program.    The statement also stressed that the Egyptian Government's  current policies of liberalizing trade, reforming the structures  of public establishments, and privatization will inevitably  reduce the budget deficit and increase investment.    The statement said the private sector is the center of  economic development in Egypt and should be encouraged to make  the required and appropriate initiatives in this regard.    The statement pointed out the EU contribution to achieving a  series of important programs in Egypt, especially through  financial protocols. It also pointed out the EU's approval of  Egypt's programs of privatization and reform of public sector  establishments with a view to helping Egypt complete its  economic process.    The EU stressed its support for Egypt's efforts to  liberalize  its trade and reduce its tariff abroad.    The EU expressed support for Egypt's request to increase its  exports to the EU market so as to redress the trade balance  deficit.    In response to the offer by the European side, Egypt  expressed willingness to start exploratory talks with the EU  soon on a new partnership agreement covering every area of  cooperation.    The two sides welcomed the initiative to discover new forms  of cooperation between them in accordance with a new agreement  reflecting all the aspects of their special relations.    The joint statement said the European side will report to  the  council on the results of those talks and make appropriate  proposals.     "

He will visit Israel for the first time since 1982, when Mr Mitterrand was the first serving French president to do so, thus opening a reconciliation between the two countries. Paris has been eager to forge closer ties since the June election victory of an Israeli Labour administration, committed to progress in peace talks with the Arabs. However, the tour comes at a sensitive moment in relations with Israel, because of Mr Mitterrand's recent refusal to apologise for the wartime Vichy regime's persecution of French Jews and his decision to send a wreath to the tomb of Marshal Philippe Petain, the Vichy leader. French influence in the Middle East has dwindled since the Gulf war, because of its arms sales to Iraq, and the country has played only a minor role in the Arab-Israeli peace talks. France has accordingly started to play an important part in encouraging talks on economic matters between the two sides, having hosted last month an economic conference of Israelis and Palestinians in Paris. The French government tabled a plan to rebuild the regional rail network and plans to promote this idea on the coming tour. The 150-strong delegation, which includes senior industrialists, will focus on immediate rail projects, such as for a link to the Red Sea port of Eilat and the electrification of a line from Haifa to Tel Aviv. Mr Mitterrand, who last week called for an end to the 'unacceptable, immoral' Arab boycott of Israel, will meet Palestinian leaders tomorrow. He will then move on to Jordan, a long-standing French ally. He is due to discuss the progress of the peace talks with King Hussein.  The Financial Times   London Page 4  "

King Norodom Sihanouk offered to host the negotiations at his royal palace, but the continuing warfare in northern and western Cambodia together with complaints from Khmer Rouge leaders that their safety could not be guaranteed in Phnom Penh meant the talks had to be called off. 'We must put an end to this war but no-one listens to me,' a downcast King Sihanouk told Cambodian journalists. 'The round table cannot take place for the time being because there is a very serious difference between Phnom Penh and the Khmer Rouge.' Khmer Rouge guerrillas recently recaptured their headquarters at the gem-mining town of Pailin near the Thai border and their northern stronghold at Anlong Veng, and are intensifying their attacks on government-held areas. A Buddhist monk and a nun were killed in the north-west on Saturday by the Khmer Rouge, while taking part in a 'peace march' in the company of government soldiers; six men working for a Cambodian mine-clearing project are believed to have been killed in an ambush; and fighting has closed the main road linking to Thailand to Cambodia to all but military traffic and forced the evacuation of UN staff from Sisophon. In the south, four westerners are being held by the Khmer Rouge as part of what seems to be a new tactic of hostage-taking, and embassies have urged their nationals to take care while travelling. Tens of thousands of Cambodians have fled the fighting, either to other parts of the country or to Thailand. The Cambodian government is now considering legislation to outlaw the Khmer Rouge. A year ago this month, Cambodians went to the polls at the culmination of a Dollars 2bn UN peacekeeping operation. The outcome of the election was a coalition government bringing together the royalist Funcinpec party and the previous communist administration, but the Khmer Rouge refused to take part or to relinquish territory. The guerrillas, although weakened by popular support for the UN-sponsored peace process, bided their time until the departure of most of the peacekeepers. According to Prince Ranariddh, senior prime minister and Funcinpec leader, the government's policy is to keep the door open for talks with the Khmer Rouge while weakening the guerrillas militarily. At present, however, it is the government army which is on the defensive.   Countries:-  KHZ  Kampuchea, Asia.   Industries:-  P9721 International Affairs.   Types:-  NEWS  General News.

The shooting, the first since the IRA and loyalist paramilitaries declared ceasefires, cast a shadow over the Northern Ireland peace process. It will almost certainly increase pressure on London and Dublin to step up their efforts to secure the surrender of paramilitary weapons. Reaction to the murder was generally restrained, though Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, accused the Royal Ulster Constabulary of trying to damage the peace process by blaming republicans for the shooting. The IRA said its position on the two-month-old ceasefire remained unchanged. Dublin's decision to cancel the release orders for the IRA prisoners was announced by Mrs Maire Geoghegan-Quinn, the Irish justice minister, after a meeting with Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister. It came less than 24 hours after her department gave details of the men to be freed as part of the Irish government's response to the IRA's ceasefire. An embarrassed Dublin government said it had stopped their releases because initial reports from the RUC suggested 'the possible participation' of Provisional IRA members. Mrs Geoghegan-Quinn said the planned releases had been 'based specifically on the premise that the Provisional IRA campaign of violence was over for good'. However after a cabinet meeting, government sources insisted the peace process would not be derailed by the killing. Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, said he was 'deeply angered' by the 'callous and wicked' murder. It demonstrated, he added, 'the wanton dangers of illegally held arms'. The attack took place in Newry, Co Down. Three armed men, dressed as postmen and using a post office van, entered a fenced sorting centre. An employee, Mr Frank Kerr, 53, was shot dead after a struggle. Two of the armed men were later arrested after a chase involving helicopters near the Irish border. The third escaped and was last night being sought by police. Sinn Fein insisted last night that the raid was not the work of the IRA and did not represent a breach of the ceasefire. Republican sources in South Armagh, a strongly nationalist area, said the raid was the work of renegade, freelance republicans committing a straightforward criminal act to make some money. A statement from the IRA implied as much, asserting simply: 'On August 31 the IRA announced a complete cessation of military operations. All our units were instructed accordingly. This position has not changed.' Mr Adams was said to be 'visibly shaken' when told of the raid by a reporter. Yesterday's killing came on the eve of a meeting between British and Irish officials to discuss the framework document which the two governments hope will form the basis of a durable political settlement in the province. Sir Patrick and Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, are to discuss the document in the Republic of Ireland on Monday. British and Irish politicians said the shooting showed the need for a rapid surrender of weapons. Mr Seamus Mallon, Social Democratic and Labour party MP for Newry, said: 'It was an IRA operation whether it was sanctioned or not by those they call their leaders.' His view was echoed by Mr David Trimble, Ulster Unionist party spokesman on legal affairs. He said: 'Freelance operations don't take place in that area unless they're licensed by the IRA.'

All Serb forces on Igman must withdraw beyond the agreed lines by 1400 GMT today, General Francis Briquemont, commander of UN forces in Bosnia, said last night. He and UN chief of staff Brigadier Vere Hayes said the new lines removed the last stumbling block to the resumption of the peace talks in Geneva. 'From my point of view the impasse is over,' Gen Briquemont said. UN officials had been meeting Bosnian Serb leaders in Sarajevo to resolve the dispute over the Serb withdrawal. Brig Hayes said about 250 French UN troops had moved into areas from which Serb forces were now steadily leaving and Moslem-led government forces had pledged not to try to retake them. He indicated the UN would use force to resist any incursions. But Commander Barry Frewer, spokesman for UN forces in Sarajevo, said he could not confirm earlier Serb claims that their forces had withdrawn from Mount Igman, which they overran last week. In Geneva, international mediators Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg yesterday postponed peace talks until Monday. It was hoped the two-day break would give UN peacekeepers in Sarajevo time to settle the Igman dispute and allow the Moslem-led government, the Croats and the Serbs to prepare negotiating positions for full-scale talks. Mr John Mills, their spokesman, said the pause would allow time for the inspection of a ceasefire line by Brig Hayes and a Bosnian Serb commander, General Manojlo Milovanovic, around Mount Igman. Bosnia's President Alija Izetbegovic yesterday said he would insist on the lifting of the Serb siege round Sarajevo on Monday when talks on the republic's ethnic division are scheduled to resume. Asked whether he expected Nato airstrikes to lift the Serb siege, he was dismissive: 'As you see the peace talks were on the verge of collapse, but the west did not do anything.' The weekend postponement is likely to slow the growing momentum in calls for western military intervention to break the 17-month siege of Sarajevo. In Washington, US officials yesterday sought to play down earlier threats that they would call for Nato air strikes if the Serbs did not withdraw from the mountain. Mr Warren Christopher, secretary of state, said the US was not yet ready to ask for military action, although he called on the Serbs to end their 'strangulation' of Sarajevo. Amid signs that the European allies remained nervous of pressing ahead with action too rapidly, the Russian Foreign Ministry sought to distance itself from the threatened air strikes. Meanwhile, publicity over the plight of Sarajevo prompted several European countries to step up their humanitarian efforts to the city. In Britain the first stage of an airlift got under way to bring out a group of severely injured victims from the city. The Overseas Development Agency in London said an aircraft was flying from Britain to the Ancona airbase in Italy, where 41 victims to be evacuated from Sarajevo will be picked up this weekend. The Swedish Foreign Ministry said it was set to bring out 14 seriously injured Bosnians. In Sarajevo, UN officials called for more aid for the city, and a British doctor questioned the UN list of the victims, saying he had seen more pressing cases in the hospitals. Serbia has appealed to the International Court in The Hague over alleged Bosnian massacres of Serb civilians. The court is due to hear similar accusations, made against the Serbs, on August 25.

Earlier, a second Palestinian attack in 24 hours came - as Israel remembered 6m Jews killed in the Nazi Holocaust. Closure of the occupied territories cuts off tens of thousands of Palestinians from their jobs. The move is intended to calm growing fears in Israel that Islamic groups may carry out more attacks to avenge the massacre of 29 Palestinians in a Hebron mosque in February. In yesterday's attack, a Palestinian guerrilla of the Islamic Jihad group, who lived in a refugee camp in the Gaza Strip, sprayed a bus stop with gunfire at a busy intersection in the southern Israeli town of Ashdod. An Israeli was killed and four wounded. Extremist Islamic groups, now responsible for slaying eight Israelis in two separate attacks, have warned they will step up their violent activities and 'continue in the path of blood and martyrdom'. President Bill Clinton condemned the Palestinian attacks as 'acts of terrorism' aimed at stopping the Middle East peace process. The Palestine Liberation Organisation, in its first official comment, said it regretted Wednesday's car bombing which left seven Israelis dead and urged Israel to implement the Israeli-Palestinian peace accord as soon as possible. But the US said last night it was not satisfied with the PLO's reaction and expected Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO leader, to condemn the killings. Despite intense domestic pressure Mr Yitzhak Rabin's government said it would continue peace talks with the PLO in Cairo on Sunday, after observing the annual Holocaust mem-orial day and the Jewish sabbath. Hamas called on Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza to stock food and supplies for 'an atmosphere of real war which will engulf the Zionist soldiers and enemy commanders in the coming days.' Hamas, which bitterly opposes the Israeli-PLO peace agreement and wants to build an Islamic state in the historic land of Palestine, said at least four more attacks were being prepared. Right-wing opposition leaders in Israel have demanded peace talks be suspended and Mr Rabin resign.   Countries:-  ILZ  Israel, Middle East.   Industries:-  P9721 International Affairs.

They  exchanged views on the current phase of the peace process in  Bosnia, particularly in light of the Washington agreement on  creating a Muslim-Croat federation.

'We're going to continue to try to bring peace to that troubled corner of the world,' the president said.' Mr Bush refused to elaborate on the cause for his optimism. The president said he had telephoned Mr James Baker, the secretary of state, who yesterday cut short his talks in Israel after hearing of his mother's death. Mr Baker's trip was interrupted at a key moment in his latest Middle East mission as he sought to nudge Israel into regional peace talks. However, his two weeks of roving diplomacy have produced two accomplishments: Egypt's agreement to participate in a peace conference and a Soviet pledge to play co-host. News of his mother's death reached Mr Baker while he was meeting Israel's Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, on his second trip to Israel in a week. He had arrived in Israel on Thursday night from the Soviet Union. He also met leaders in Syria, Jordan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait during the week. Both Israel and the US are anxious to give the impression that the peace process is still alive, despite disagreements between them. Israeli Foreign Ministry officials said the two countries reached agreement on five issues, including the co-sponsorship of the conference by the Soviet Union. But two key issues that have yet to be resolved are Palestinian representation at the conference and a possible role for the United Nations. Israel rejects the participation of Palestinian residents of Israeli-annexed East Jerusalem and opposes a role for the UN in the conference, as demanded by Arab states such as Syria. Both Israel and the US see the regional peace conference as a means of laying the groundwork for bilateral talks between Israel and Arab states and between Israel and the Palestinians. Israeli officials said Moscow's co-sponsorship of the peace conference was dependent on the restoration of full diplomatic ties with Israel. The other points agreed on, according to Israeli officials, were that Europe would play a yet to be defined role in the peace conference; the conference would not have the authority to reach or impose decisions; Israel would have veto power over the conference reconvening to hear progress reports; and the conference could be used to discuss other regional issues such as water, development and arms cuts. Because of his departure, Mr Baker was unable to meet defence minister Moshe Arens and prominent Palestinians.  The Financial Times   London Page 2  "

At first the story was put about that the tragedy occurred  as  the result of mortar fire, allegedly from positions held by  Serbian armed formations. Later, when the real scale of this  inhuman carnage began to become apparent, people started saying  that the fire might not have come from Serbian positions but  from some others. Then they started saying that the series of  explosions occurred right on the spot as the result of charges  which had been laid earlier and which someone (but who?!) set  off.    It is beyond doubt that, whoever was to blame for this  tragedy, this killer (or killers) must be punished and appear  before a court. Is this not the reason why the international  tribunal in The Hague for crimes against the person on territory  in the former Yugoslavia was set up? Only I believe that this  killer will never be found. There are several points which  cause me to think along these lines.    Right after the tragedy, the Serbian side in Bosnia issued a  statement in which it urged the holding of an international  investigation into the crime that had been committed and  guaranteed unimpeded access to the site for international  experts. Why would it do this if some people accuse precisely  it of the tragedy?    There are other disconcerting points. This is not the first  such instance, you know. More than a year ago, also in  Sarajevo, a shell allegedly fired from a tank gun killed 20  people and injured dozens of peaceful residents at a bus stop  close to the market in the Muslim districts. Then too there  were demands for the Serb tankman who allegedly drove up to that  spot and fired the shot to be called to account. There were  calls for NATO aircraft to start bombing Serbian positions  without delay. Then it turned out that neither the tank nor the  mythical Serbian tankman had existed. The author of that  tragedy was never found.    It cannot escape your notice that both these events occurred  on the eve of the conclusion of peace talks among the three  warring sides in Bosnia and Herzegovina. At that time the talks  were wrecked.    By the beginning of 1994 the Serbs and Croats had virtually  completely agreed their positions and displayed readiness to end  hostilities. The Muslim side had also begun to voice  satisfaction with the talks. The very dangerous military  conflict at the center of Europe seemed to be finally  approaching a peaceful outcome. But suddenly (suddenly?) the  position of the Bosnia and Herzegovina leadership hardened, and  it demanded territorial concessions from the Serbs and Croats.  In the end, the concessions were made. The talks were led out  of the impasse. But the Muslim side again, for the umpteenth  time, pulled out of the talks process and left Geneva virtually  without advancing any new terms at all, but demanding that the  West make bombing strikes against Serbian positions.    Once again the impasse was being surmounted, and the Serbs,  Croats, and Muslims were to meet once again in Geneva 10  February to continue the peace talks process. The tragedy in  Sarajevo could prevent that meeting.    But who would benefit from wrecking the peace talks even at  the cost of spilling a lot of blood of Sarajevo's peaceful  residents? This is the hardest question. In any case it is  perfectly obvious that neither the Serbs, nor the Croats, nor  the Muslim leadership itself benefit from the talks being  wrecked.    There is evidently still someone who cannot stomach the  possible peaceful outcome of the Balkan conflict. It is this  ""someone"" who is resorting to provocations, not afraid of blood.  It seems to me that he must be sought not among those who are  already tired of fighting and shedding their blood. The  shortest way to find him could be to ascertain just who is  constantly pressuring the Bosnia and Herzegovina leadership and  compelling it to walk out of the talks time after time. But  this, so it seems to me, is a matter for the international  tribunal in The Hague.     "

Although it has so far been rejected by Damascus, Israeli ministers made clear their insistence on the proposal following a cabinet review of the latest round of Middle East peace talks which ended in Washington last week. 'This meeting is necessary, essential. Without it we will not be able to break through the psychological and practical barriers that prevent fast progress,' said Mr Haim Ramon, health minister. During the month-long talks, due to resume on October 21, slow but unspectacular progress was reported in the four sets of bilateral negotiations between Israel officials and delegations from Syria, Jordan, Lebanon and the Palestinians. The cabinet also rejected Syria's insistence that any agreement with Israel must be linked to agreements with the other Arab parties to achieve a 'comprehensive' settlement. The Palestinians have voiced concerns that Syria and Israel might achieve a separate accord, leaving the fate of the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip unresolved. But Mr Yassir Arafat, leader of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, said he had been assured by Mr Assad that Syria would not alter its commitment to a comprehensive peace accord.

Since getting enough backing from right-wing and religious parties to ensure  his stay in power, Shamir has evaded comment on the divisive question of talks  with Palestinians, sticking to one issue on which there is broad national  agreement: that a home for as many Soviet Jews as possible must be made in  Israel.    ""Well, I hope this new government will be an efficient one. It will work in one  united spirit without too many differences among its members, and I hope the  government will work day and night for the solution of the most important  problems we are facing,"" he said in a radio interview. ""And the most important  of all these problems is the mass immigration and the acceptance of these  immigrants.""    About 150,000 Soviets are expected to arrive in Israel this year as they flee  anti-Semitism and nationalist uncertainty in the Soviet Union.    Shamir rejected descriptions of his government as right wing and hard-line. His  new Cabinet faces a parliamentary vote of confidence Monday. ""This government  represents a large (share) of parties inside our political community, and I can  say, without hesitation, that this government represents the majority of our  people,"" Shamir told a radio interviewer.    When asked about American proposals to talk with Palestinians, Shamir hedged,  saying that ahead lies a long process of getting his Cabinet approved, putting  ministries into action and tackling problems.    Israel's relations with the Bush Administration have been under strain over the  lack of progress in making peace between Israel and the Palestinians in revolt  on the Israeli-held West Bank and Gaza Strip.    Shamir has proposed elections for the West Bank and Gaza to let Palestinians  choose a peace panel. On Saturday, he reaffirmed his offer, although several  members of his new Cabinet, including members of his own Likud Party, oppose  the plan. In any case, it has bogged down over difficulties in designating a  group of Palestinians to sign on to the proposal; Shamir rejects giving a role  to the Palestine Liberation Organization, which has a wide following among  Palestinians.    Shamir's comments Saturday highlighted the difference in priorities between  himself and Shimon Peres, the leader of the rival Labor Party who tried to  unseat Shamir in March. Peres' effort to build his own coalition and become  prime minister failed when he could not command a majority in Parliament.    Peres focused on peace as his primary goal. He argued that success in solving  Israel's problems, including immigration, depended on reducing tensions with  the Arabs.    Shamir, on the other hand, suggested that peace is just one in a galaxy of  Israeli problems and not necessarily the most pressing. ""In the next weeks, we  will take some decisions about our steps in many parts of our activity.  Diplomatic activity, immigration, absorption, etc.,"" he said Saturday.    His reluctance to tackle the Palestinian peace issue seemed to confirm early  Israeli opinion that any move in the direction of peace talks will bring down  the government. Shamir claims only a two-member majority in Israel's  Parliament.    Along the spectrum of Shamir's core of support, the hard-line context becomes  clear. Ariel Sharon, the hawkish former defense minister who is now housing  minister, said that peace can only come after the Palestinian rebellion is  subdued. ""I think one of the main goals of the state of Israel is, of course,  to restore order . . . because otherwise there won't be any possibility to move  toward peace,"" he said Saturday. Sharon also affirmed plans to build new  settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip as well as permit new Soviet  immigrants to settle there.    Geula Cohen, a member of the rightist Tehiya Party which favors annexing the  West Bank and Gaza, warned that moves toward talks with Palestinians could  split the coalition. ""If they will do so (talk) in a way that we think that any  promotion of this initiative is endangering the security of the state of  Israel, we will be out of this government,"" she said.

The Palestinians, Syria, Jordan and Lebanon had suspended their departure for Washington in protest at Israel's decision to expel 12 Palestinians from the occupied territories, an action that was unanimously condemned by the UN Security Council on Monday night. The other Arab delegations said last night they would leave for Washington in two days. Israel's delegation has been in Washington since Monday. 'The Security Council has saved the peace process, and we can only express our appreciation of its efforts and those of all the countries which contributed (to the decision),' Mr Ahmed Abderrahman, the PLO spokesman, said in Tunis. The UN resolution condemning Israel's plans to expel 12 Palestinians drew harsh criticism in Jerusalem. Israel said it was set to go ahead with the expulsion plans, despite the worldwide condemnation. Mr Moshe Arens, the defence minister, had announced the expulsions last week following the murder of a Jewish settler in the occupied territories, the fourth to be killed there since Middle East peace talks opened in Madrid in October. 'We are very disappointed by the unjust and one-sided decision of the Security Council. It ignores completely the acts of murder against Israeli citizens,' said Mr Ehud Gol, spokesman to Mr Yitzhak Shamir, the prime minister. The UN security council resolution, which received full US backing, was passed by a vote of 15-0. The 12 Palestinians ordered expelled by Israel - most of them relatively unknown - are suspected of activism in Palestinian nationalist organisations. Israel has expelled 66 Arabs since the start of the Palestinian uprising in 1987. Mr Shimon Peres, leader of the opposition Labour party, hinted yesterday that the timing of the move had been inappropriate. 'They should have considered very carefully whether the expulsions were appropriate at this time and whether they would in fact achieve their aims,' he said. Israeli forces shot dead a Palestinian and wounded 20 in Gaza yesterday in a clash with hundreds of youngsters protesting at Israel's decision to expel the 12 Palestinian activists, Palestinian sources said, Reuter writes from Jerusalem.

'Syria believes time is on the Arabs' side so we need not hurry for a settlement which will not restore the Arabs' usurped rights,' the ruling party newspaper al-Baath said. 'Here we should cite a quotation from the Arab leader (Syrian President) Hafez al-Assad in which he said future generations would be able to restore the Arabs' rights if our generation could not,' added the newspaper. But al-Baath said this did not mean Syria would abandon the Middle East peace process. Syria and Israel have held direct peace talks for almost two years without achieving tangible progress.

Mr Milosevic, whom many believe to be backing Bosnian Serb aggression in Bosnia-Hercegovina, will be told Bosnian Serbs must drop their demand for a 'state-within-a-state' that could later be linked with a Greater Serbia. Mr Vance and Lord Owen regard this demand as the principal obstacle to a Bosnian settlement, and have said that if the talks break down they will not hesitate to name the party responsible. This would make almost inevitable some kind of UN-sanctioned military action against the Bosnian Serbs and perhaps Serbia itself, initially through enforcement of the no-fly zone over Bosnia. Mr Fred Eckhard, spokesman for Mr Vance and Lord Owen, said yesterday that Mr Milosevic was 'a key player' and 'in a position to push this peace process home'. He added: 'Time is running out in terms of what the international community is willing to live with.' The first session of talks between the warring Serb, Croat and mainly Moslem government factions adjourned on Monday evening, after Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb chief, said he needed to consult Serbian leaders, including Mr Milosevic.

The move will start an important phase of the Northern Ireland peace process. The announcement - made in a letter to Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, from a senior Downing Street official - came three months to the day after the IRA's ceasefire. Decommissioning of paramilitary arsenals will be top of the agenda in the talks, which are intended to start bringing Sinn Fein into the political mainstream. The Sinn Fein team is to be led by Mr Martin McGuinness, a vice-president in the organisation. Mr Quentin Thomas, the Number Two civil servant in the Northern Ireland Office, will lead the government's team. The talks will be held in Belfast, probably at Stormont. Yesterday's announcement of an earlier-than-expected date for the talks came as the government appeared to bow to US pressure over whether Sinn Fein members would be invited to an important Belfast investment conference this month. Several US institutions and corporations had threatened to boycott the conference unless Sinn Fein was included. They included Mr Alan Hevesi, New York City controller, who earlier this year signalled a plan to channel institutional funds towards Ulster in the form of 'Irish peace bonds', and Mr William Flyn, chairman of Mutual America, one of the biggest American insurance companies, who has helped to co-ordinate private investor interest in Ulster. Congressional supporters of the Irish Republicans urged the US administration not to allow Mr Ron Brown, US Commerce Secretary, to attend the conference unless the British government invited Mr Adams. Yesterday the government said a handful of Sinn Fein councillors would after all be invited in their capacity as members of two local council committees. The decision is thought to have had an important bearing on the starting date of preliminary talks with Sinn Fein, in effect entailing that they had to get under way before the conference on December 13 and 14. Ulster Unionists and some senior Conservatives were under the impression until very recently that the talks would begin only just before Christmas. Reaction to yesterday's announcement was mixed. The Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the hardline Democratic Unionist party, said the decision to hold talks with the 'men of blood' was 'highly resented'. But the move was welcomed by Ms Marjorie Mowlam, shadow Northern Ireland secretary. Mr Adams also responded positively: 'The opportunity to realise a lasting peace which will benefit all of the people of Ireland has never been greater.' In Washington, President Bill Clinton welcomed the announcement, saying that a just and lasting settlement in Northern Ireland was 'finally within reach'. Separately, he announced the appointment of Senator George Mitchell, the retiring leader of the Democratic Senate majority, to be his special adviser on Ulster economic initiatives. The Commerce Department said Mr Brown definitely planned to attend the conference. Mr Mitchell will consider attending. The issue became entangled with negotiations over Mr Adams's visit to Washington next week. Although the British government has not sought to dissuade the US from granting Mr Adams another visa, it has argued successfully that he must still not be allowed to raise funds in the US.

'Arafat urged US Secretary of State Warren Christopher to  make ""the maximum effort"" to ensure the success of the  negotiations, during a telephone conversation.    The PLO leader stressed the importance of meeting the April  13 deadline set for Israel to withdraw from the occupied Gaza  Strip and West Bank town of Jericho.    Under the Israeli-PLO Declaration of Principles signed in  September Israel was due to complete its troop withdrawal by  April 13, but implementation of the deal was delayed by  disagreements over security arrangements and the February 25  Hebron massacre.    'Arafat said any Israeli failure to respect the timetable  set  out in the autonomy deal ""will have negative repercussions on  the whole peace process and threaten its credibility,"" WAFA  reported.    The PLO leader also called for the rapid deployment of an  international presence in the occupied territories, in line with  UN Security Council Resolution 904 of March 18, which condemned  the Hebron massacre and allowed for international protection for  the Palestinians.    Israel and the PLO agreed last month that 160 lightly-armed  observers from Norway, Denmark and Italy would be deployed in  Hebron, where a Jewish settler shot dead 30 Arab worshipers in a  mosque.    The two sides began a new round of talks in Cairo on Sunday  in a bid to resolve remaining differences, including a timetable  for Israeli withdrawal and the deployment of a Palestinian  police force.    'Arafat and Christopher also discussed the escalating  violence in the occupied territories, and the harm it could  inflict on ""the entire Middle East peace process and the  (Israeli-PLO) negotiations,"" WAFA reported.    'Arafat discussed the same issues by telephone with US civil  rights leader Jesse Jackson, currently visiting Israel, the  agency said.

Details of the talks remained wrapped in secrecy as all sides appeared determined to keep the peace process going. Mr John Mills, the Geneva conference spokesman, said the 90-minute meeting had 'a good and constructive atmosphere'. As the negotiators met, French troops at a United Nations base in Sarajevo came under artillery fire for the second time in two days. Participants in the talks agreed to discuss this attack when they reconvene this afternoon. The talks, which could lead to a carve-up of Bosnia, involve leaders of the three main ethnic groups along with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, his Croatian counterpart Mr Franjo Tudjman and President Momir Bulatovic of Montenegro, which with Serbia forms the rump Yugoslav state. The talks came as international mediators Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg tried to persuade Mr Alija Izetbegovic, Bosnia's Moslem president, to drop his demand that a future Bosnia be based on centralised federation. Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, and Mr Mate Boban, his Bosnian Croat counterpart, have called for creation of a loose confederation, which Mr Izetbegovic says will lead to more war. The two peace envoys reportedly told Mr Izetbegovic that a newly created mainly Moslem state would receive economic aid from Moslem countries as well as the US. The mediators have pledged, in the event of division, that the mainly Moslem state would be granted at least 30 per cent of Bosnian territory and access to ports on the Adriatic Sea and the northern River Sava.

This outrageous act, which reminds the Arabs and Muslims of  the Dayr Yasin Massacre in 1948, emphasizes to the whole world  the extreme seriousness of the continuing Israeli occupation of  the territories and settling in it in contravention of all laws  and statutes and as a flagrant challenge to the UN resolutions  and Charter.    It has become clear to the entire international community  that Israel's intransigent stands, expansionist aims, and the  policies of evasion and procrastination which it has been  following in the peace talks for more than two years are the  primary cause of the acts of violence in the occupied Arab  territories. Israel is responsible, directly or indirectly, for  extremism in the region.    Syria, which is aware that the whole world deplores this  savage massacre, is well aware that words of denunciation and  condemnation are not enough to end the circles of violence and  terror, and that an end to the Israeli occupation without  further procrastination and stalling within the framework of the  current peace talks [fi itari muhadathat al-salam al-jariyah]  and allowing the Palestinian people to acquire their right of  self-determination will ensure ending extremism and acts of  violence and realizing just and comprehensive peace in the  region.

Dr. al-'Anani said that the decision to ""cut short""  bilateral  talks in the U.S. capital in protest after the Feb. 25 massacre  of Palestinian worshipers in Hebron by an extremist Jewish  settler was taken within an Arab context and had to be similarly  reversed.    ""We need an Arab decision,"" Dr. al-'Anani said. His comments  came after a cabinet meeting Saturday during which details of a  United Nations Security Council resolution condemning the Hebron  massacre were discussed.    Dr. al-'Anani said the Kingdom welcomed the Security  Council's resolution condemning the massacre but expressed  reservations over Washington's decision to abstain from voting  on the part of the resolution that described Arab East Jerusalem  as Israeli-occupied territory.    ""We hope that the Israeli statements that Jerusalem is the  eternal capital of Israel have not received a boost by the  American vote,"" said Dr. al-'Anani.    He said that Jordan had been made to understand that the  U.S.  abstention ""was in line with what they said was the terms of the  Oslo agreement which relegates the negotiations over Jerusalem  to final status talks.""    ""But our position is that Jerusalem is an occupied territory  regardless of when its final status is to be negotiated,"" Dr.  al-'Anani added,    The minister, however, described the resolution, passed late  Friday after weeks of haggling, as a ""good decision.""    He said that the resolution provided positive stipulations  protecting the Palestinians in the occupied territories.    Dr. al-'Anani added that Jordan ""viewed positively"" the  resolution's call for accelerating the peace process and  reiteration of the applicability of the 1949 Fourth Geneva  Convention to the territories occupied by Israel in June 1967  including Jerusalem.    A source in Jordan's delegation to the peace talks said an  announcement by U.S. Ambassador Madeline Albright that Jordan,  Syria and Lebanon had agreed to resume negotiations with Israel  in April ""is inaccurate.""    The source, who asked for anonymity, said that Jordan's  decision to consult with its Arab partners before resuming  negotiations ""does not mean that Jordan will not return"" to the  negotiating table in April as was announced by the U.S. envoy.  [sentence as published]    The Kingdom, along with Syria and Lebanon, ""only took a  decision to cut short a round of bilateral talks between the  heads of the negotiating teams in Washington in February."" The  three teams left the U.S. capital three days before the  scheduled end of that round.    At the time, Jordanian sources said that the negotiators  were  not expected to return to Washington before April mostly to  accommodate religious holidays of the Muslims and Christians in  March and early April.

Moscow has sent the deputy foreign minister, Igor Ivanov,  on a special mission to the Middle East. The aim of of the  visit, during which Ivanov will meet President Yasir 'Arafat, is  to give the peace process in the region a fresh impetus. Russia  continues to stimulate mediation efforts aimed at ensuring the  success of the Arab-Israeli direct talks. Moscow has agreed to  Washington's proposal of sending out an invitation to the  negotiating parties to resume the talks in the U.S. capital.    After meeting the Palestinian president in Tunis, Ivanov  will  go to Israel to hold talks with officials there. In the light  of these talks, Moscow will decide its subsequent steps in its  Middle East foreign policy.    This is what Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev  announced at a news conference yesterday. He had a phone  conversation with his Israeli counterpart, Shimon Peres, who  informed Kozyrev of Israel's agreement to allow foreign civilian  observers to visit the Palestinian occupied territories. In the  meantime the Israeli Government is taking some measures to  reduce the gravity of the negative impact of the Hebron massacre  on the talks process. For example, the release has started  today of hundreds of Palestinians from prisons, and the policy  of limiting contacts between Jewish settlers and the  Palestinians to avoid new bloody clashes continues.    Representatives of the PLO in the occupied territories think  that the release of a few hundred Palestinian prisoners is not  enough, because the heart of the matter is the release of all  the 10,000 prisoners.    On its part, the United States was busy coordinating with  the  Palestinians and Israelis on the Security Council draft  resolution, the main aim of which is to put an end to the bloody  acts of violence exchanged in the Palestinian occupied  territories.    The U.S. permanent representative at the UN said that the  agreement on the text of the document [UN Security Council  resolution] is being finalized word by word to avoid a different  interpretation in the future.    The Security Council will continue discussing the  consequences of the Hebron massacre today. Representatives of  more than 30 UN member states have asked to address the session.  Therefore, it is possible that the Security Council's meetings  could last several days.    The current circumstances indicate that the international  community is concerned that the Middle East peace process should  continue until a just and lasting peace has been established in  the region, and until a secure and peaceful situation has  developed for all the peoples and states of the region.    Obsessed extremist terrorists from both sides must never be  allowed to hinder or stop the progress of the negotiating  process, the final aim if which is to reconcile between Israelis  and Arabs on a basis acceptable equally to them and to the  international community.

0,FT941-4004 ,"FT941-4004 _AN-ECNC2AATFT 940314   FT  14 MAR 94 / Envoys near critical stage in hunt for Bosnian peace: US and Russia anxious to begin drawing up maps      By JUDY DEMPSEY   The US and Russia, now co-ordinating every move in the search for peace in the former Yugoslavia, want to resolve one of the more intractable aspects of a settlement for Bosnia: the maps. After three days of negotiations in Vienna, Zagreb and Sarajevo, Mr Charles Redman, the US special envoy, and Mr Vitaly Churkin, his Russian counterpart, are reaching a critical stage in negotiations over Bosnia's future. US and UN officials said that if the Bosnian Serbs could not be brought on board to join the complex federation of Bosnia's Moslems and Croats - the draft constitution of which was agreed by the two former adversaries in Vienna yesterday - then the Bosnian Serbs would have to decide whether to cede land in return for peace. Otherwise, they added, the Bosnian Serbs could find themselves in a 'limbo', with their territory The search for a settlement intensified over the weekend when: General John Galvin, the former supreme commander of Nato, helped forge a defence agreement between Bosnia's Croats and Moslems leading to the establishment of one Bosnian army. US officials stressed this would not provide the means for a new offensive against the Bosnian Serbs. 'Its aim is to stop the fighting between Croats and Moslems. It is also the first step towards creation of a federation in one part of Bosnia,' a US official said. After talks in Zagreb, the Croatian capital, Mr Churkin said he would not rule out Serb participation in the federation. Even Mr Momcilo Krajisnik, speaker of the Bosnian Serbs' self-proclaimed parliament and an important negotiator, said Serbs were willing to join peace talks or some some kind of co-existence with Moslems and Croats within Bosnia. In Sarajevo, Bosnian Serb and Moslems said they had set up a preliminary agreement to open up to civilian traffic routes in and out of the Bosnian capital. This could be the beginning of the lifting of the siege, and an eventual demilitarisation of the city. Mr Churkin, who met Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic in Sarajevo yesterday, will today hold talks with Serb leaders in Belgrade, the Serbian capital. US officials said the talks could pave the way for an overall peace settlement for Bosnia and Croatia. Mr Churkin must establish today whether President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia is ready to sue for peace, which would lead to the lifting of sanctions. Any moves towards peace would require Belgrade persuading the Bosnian Serbs, who hold nearly 70 per cent of Bosnia, to reduce their control to about 49 per cent. During the Bosnian Croat and Moslem talks hosted by the US in Vienna, maps have not been discussed for the federation as any decisions would have to involve negotiations with the Bosnian Serbs. Sections of the Bosnian Serb leadership are loath to cede any land. It would mean breaking the fragile territorial corridors linking Serbs living in Krajina, south-western Croatia, to Bosnian Serb territory, and ultimately to Serbia proper. 'It is difficult to know if the links between Milosevic and the Krajina Serbs are weaker than those between the Bosnian Serbs and Krajina,' a UN negotiator said. 'Milosevic has to decide if he is prepared to weaken those links (with Krajina) in return for sanctions being lifted; equally the Bosnian Serbs must recognise they have no legitimacy as a self-proclaimed state if they do not negotiate,' he added. But the overriding consideration with regard to the status - and fate - of the Krajina Serbs is the extent to which they can be used as pawns by Belgrade in the hunt for a settlement with Croatia and Bosnia. 'The future status Krajina holds is the linchpin for peace between Croatia and Serbia,' a UN peace negotiator said. 'Croatia wants full control of its territory, including Krajina. But the Krajina Serbs do not want to live in Croatia, regardless of pressure from Belgrade. They are the Achilles' heel.' Despite this, Bosnian Serbs - and Mr Milosevic - continue to hold a strong negotiating position. They can argue that the federation of Bosnian Croats and Moslems will be linked to Croatia through a confederation, in effect creating an eventual Greater Croatia and rewarding Croat gains in western Hercegovina. Consequently they can ask why the Bosnian Serbs in eastern Bosnian cannot link to Serbia proper. 'The answer is that the US wants to maintain a semblance of Bosnia's territorial integrity. But we know that under a new guise, and with haggling over the maps, Bosnia is already being carved up between Zagreb and Belgrade,' a UN official said.

The paper adds: It is illogical for the negotiating process  to remain at Israel's mercy, and hostage to its bloody crimes.  Likewise, it should be unreasonable for the Arabs to continue to  conduct the negotiations on the basis of commitment to the peace  process when the Israelis are free of any obligations or  commitments.    AL-THAWRAH goes on to say: In its open war, Israel has been  engaged in programmed terrorism, in a war of extermination and  destruction in the name of peace. The Arabs are always asked  not to protest to avoid inflaming emotions, and so that the  peace process may not be undermined. To put it bluntly, the  Arabs alone are asked to show flexibility, exercise restraint,  and receive blows to maintain the momentum in the peace process  as if the Arabs alone are the party concerned with this process.  The Arabs are perceived as the party that must reward Israel  and make concessions that consecrate the usurpation of Arab  territories and rights, as well as submission to Israeli  dictates and domination.    The paper says: Had Israel been in the Arabs' shoes; namely,  had it been the victim receiving blows and the target of daily  air raids and shelling, in which the most sophisticated weapons  are used, and had the massacre struck a Jewish synagogue instead  of the holy Ibrahimi Mosque or the Sayyidat al-Najat Church,  certainly the reaction of the West, and the United States in  particular, would not have been so timid or confined to  condemnation and denunciation. Had this been the case, the Arabs  would have become the target of a sweeping campaign.    Concluding its commentary, AL-THAWRAH says: Undoubtedly, the  shocking and horrendous Hebron massacre has turned many concepts  upside down and changed many things. Thanks to this massacre,  it has become difficult to continue the bilateral talks, or  resume them as if nothing has happened. Salvaging the peace  process and the stalled peace talks requires the application of  all sorts of pressures on Israel to make it honor the relevant  international legitimacy resolutions and conventions, respect  human rights, dismantle settlements, disarm settlers, and return  to the Arabs all their territories and rights.

0,FT941-11024 ,"FT941-11024 _AN-EBGC7ABXFT 940207   FT  07 FEB 94 / Major and Reynolds aim to restore united front      By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor   The British and Irish prime ministers are to meet in London later this month to restore a common front to efforts to find a political settlement in Northern Ireland. The talks are expected to be on February 19 when Mr Albert Reynolds will be in London for the England-Ireland rugby international. The meeting follows the refusal of Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein leader, to indicate during his controversial New York visit that the IRA was prepared to renounce its campaign of violence. Growing pessimism in London about the prospects of an early end to IRA terrorism in response to December's Downing Street declaration prompted Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, to announce last week that he would table fresh ideas for a political settlement between Ulster's constitutional parties. Sir Patrick's announcement caused irritation in Dublin. The Irish government had indicated privately to London that it would prefer such negotiations to remain on hold until after Sinn Fein's party conference at the end of the month. Last night Mr Reynolds increased pressure on Sinn Fein to give a response to the call for peace. He said time was running out for a response and he expected either acceptance or rejection of the declaration by the time of the party conference. He told a meeting of the Fianna Fail party in Dublin that he had provided 'copious clarification' of the document in response to requests from Mr Adams. Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, said that political talks on Northern Ireland will go ahead 'with or without Sinn Fein'. In spite of Britain's determination to press ahead with constitutional talks Mr John Major is anxious that there should be no rift with Mr Reynolds because the process depends on maintaining the united front established by the Downing Street declaration. Mr Major is expected to reassure Mr Reynolds that Britain is not aiming for a 'minimalist' political settlement which would involve no more than the establishment of devolved government in Ulster. That option is being pressed hard by the Ulster Unionist party. But British ministers recognise that the the mainly Roman Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party will not accept the creation of a new assembly unless there is an overall agreement encompassing north-south relations and links between London and Dublin. Mr Major will tell Mr Reynolds that he wants to push ahead with this 'three-stranded' approach. He will also make it clear that the search for a political settlement would not preclude a place at the table for Sinn Fein if the IRA did end its terrorist campaign.

Fujimori's many challengers include his estranged wife, Susana Higuchi, who must win a ruling from a constitutional court to overturn a bar on relatives of the head of state standing for the presidency, and 74-year-old former UN secretary-general, Javier Perez de Cuellar. Bid to smash Windows: IBM attempts to oust Microsoft's Windows operating system for desktop computers from its market dominance by launching Warp, a new version of its OS/2. Its attack comes at a bad time for Microsoft, whose own challenger, Chicago, has been delayed. Saleroom: Two miniatures by Nicholas Hilliard, who portrayed the characters of the Elizabethan Court, come up for auction at Sotheby's in London. One of Queen Elizabeth I, dated to 1590, is estimated at Pounds 6,000 while a melancholic young man could make Pounds 30,000.

Central America's six presidents are to meet in Managua in a bid to strengthen the Alliance for Sustainable Development, a plan to protect the region's environment while exploiting its rich natural resources. UK economy: Inflation may be low, but judging by gilt yields, investors cannot believe it will stay that way. However, September's retail prices index, out today, is expected to show that underlying inflation is still within the lower half of the government's 1-4 per cent target range. Aftershock: A week after an earthquake off Japan's northern island of Hokkaido, measuring 8.2 on the Richter scale, Tokyo hosts a United Nations public forum and open lecture by Professor Haresh Shah on why the global earthquake risk is increasing.

It will contemplate the potentially inflationary impact of the IG Metall engineering union's 1995 pay claim, due on Tuesday or Wednesday. A demand for about 6 per cent is expected, but the key question is how hard the union will press its case. That depends on the election result. The return of the current government will mean a fight. But if the Social Democrats win a place in a new coalition, a peaceful and non-inflationary settlement can be virtually guaranteed. Singapore hosts a meeting to promote links between Europe and east Asia, organised by the Singapore Economic Development Board and the Geneva-based World Economic Forum.

FRIDAY General strike in Italy Italian trade unions plan a general strike in protest at plans by Silvio Berlusconi's government to rein in spending and cut pension and health benefits as part of an austerity budget for 1995. The detail and timing of the action - originally planned as a four-hour stoppage - could well depend on the sector and region. Individual unions and even factories have begun to stage strikes at short notice over the past fortnight, as the general protest coincides with more localised attempts to put pressure on employers during the annual round of wage negotiations.

Replying to a message from the Russian leader, 'Arafat said  he accepted Yeltsin's invitation for ""detailed"" discussions on  bilateral ties and Russia's contribution to implementing  Palestinian self-rule in the occupied territories.    The official Palestinian news agency WAFA quoted 'Arafat as  saying he was confident that Russia, a co-sponsor of the Middle  East peace process with the United States, would continue to  work for implementation of the Israeli-PLO autonomy deal ""in the  time scale set by the accord"", signed in Washington last  September.    Yeltsin's message was conveyed to 'Arafat on Friday by  Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev.

US and Russian co-sponsors of the forum feared the issue of Palestinian representation could provoke a walkout by the Israeli delegation. PLO calls for the Palestinian delegation in Moscow to include representatives from the diaspora, among them Jerusalem-born Palestinians, have cast a shadow over the multilateral talks, the third stage of the latest Middle East peace effort launched in Madrid last October. Seeking to downplay the argument, US and Soviet officials made it clear the Palestinian delegation must be restricted to the 'Madrid formula' allowing only representatives from the West Bank and Gaza strip, occupied by Israel in the 1967 war. A two-tier Palestinian delegation was due in Moscow last night. At the Madrid opening last October, the Palestinian team included representatives from east Jerusalem, but these did not participate directly in the discussions with Israel. Representatives from about 18 countries, including permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, are expected to sit down today in Moscow's Hall of Unions to discuss such issues as regional disarmament, economic development, water and the environment. Syria and Lebanon are boycotting the talks, claiming Israel has shown no commitment to a Middle East settlement based on the 'land for peace' formula outlined in United Nations Security Council resolutions. Radical Palestinians have condemned Arab participation. The US wants to use the Moscow meeting - involving Israel for the first time in discussing Middle East questions with Egypt, Jordan, and Turkey as well as Arabs from the Gulf and Africa - to lessen the Jewish state's regional isolation. Israel and delegations representing Syria, Lebanon and a Jordanian Palestinian team have conducted three rounds of bilateral talks in Madrid and in Washington marked by procedural argument. Mr James Baker, the US secretary of state and originator of this latest Middle East peace effort is anxious for the Moscow meeting to establish the framework for tackling multilateral Middle East issues before the general election in Israel later this year brings the peace process at least to a temporary halt.

In Belfast Sinn Fein emerged with 23.2 per cent, the biggest share of the vote for any party, outpolling even the Ulster Unionist party. Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, said the result 'has dramatically renovated Sinn Fein's mandate'. Across the province the Sinn Fein vote increased by 1.5 percentage points to 12.5 per cent, winning it 51 council seats out of the 582 total. The Ulster Unionist party, the largest party in Northern Ireland, saw its support slip by 5 points to 29 per cent, although it increased the number of seats it holds from 193 to 197. Mr Herbert Ditty, the hard-line unionist Lord Mayor of Belfast, lost his seat to Mr Chris McGimpsey, an independent unionist, but control of the council remains in Unionist hands by a slim majority. Mr Ken Maginnis, deputy leader of the UUP, lost his seat in Dungannon, while the nationalist SDLP consolidated its hold on Derry council, winning an absolute majority of 17 seats. The turnout across the province was 55 per cent. The overall nationalist vote apparently rose as Unionist participation fell. The main loser has been the Conservative party, which saw most of the gains it made in the 1989 local elections wiped out. The Conservatives won only six seats, against more than 10 last time, with support apparently drifting back to the centrist Alliance party. The Alliance vote increased by 1 point to 7.7 per cent, but its support appears increasingly concentrated in the middle-class areas of the east and south-east of the province. Mr Brian Feeney, a spokesman for the SDLP, said the vote for the political extremes had hardened in those areas which had suffered the most political violence over the past year, while the vote for the more moderate SDLP, UUP and Alliance parties had held up or improved where there was greater stability. He said the Belfast result 'will have knocked a lot of people back on their heels'. Mr Addie Morrow, until recently the chairman of the Alliance party, said: 'I believe the result is very bad for the future of Northern Ireland. The electorate has given no encouragement for the parties to get together and negotiate.' Mr Richard McCaulay, the spokesman for Sinn Fein, whose party has been excluded from talks because of its support for the IRA, said future political talks 'are almost certain to fail unless a process is developed which excludes no-one'. The DUP described its result as 'a left hook' to efforts by Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, to get talks going again. Mr Peter Robinson, the DUP deputy leader, said: 'If Sir Patrick Mayhew cannot read the message of this election then he needs glasses.' The DUP 'is not interested in the talks on the basis of the blueprint that (Sir Patrick) has offered'.

As the British and US governments continue to refrain from full acceptance of the ceasefire, Mr Taylor, the MP for Strangford, Co Down, came as close as any unionist to admitting that the IRA had fully renounced violence. 'My gut reaction is that the ceasefire is for real,' he told his constituency association. Mr Taylor, who was seriously wounded by an IRA gunman in 1972, added: 'I consider it to be my responsibility to encourage the peace process forward so that there will eventually be lasting peace.' He was clearly at odds with another unionist MP, Mr David Trimble, who claimed that the UUP's view was that the IRA had no intention of abandoning their campaign unless there were substantial concessions from the government. Writing in the Belfast Telegraph, Mr Trimble, the MP for Upper Bann, said that the ceasefire was a 'gamble' by the IRA. 'They reckon that if they fail to gain concessions, the blame for resumed violence can be placed on the British government or the loyalists.' Ulster Unionists will have been pleased with comments yesterday by Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, that the transfer of four republican terrorists from English jails to Northern Ireland only hours after the IRA ceasefire began had been 'completely wrong'.

His office said a letter had been sent to Mr Alija Izetbegovic, Bosnia's Moslem president, Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Serb leader, and Mr Mate Boban, the region's Croat leader, inviting them to London. Expressing his dismay at the repeated violation by all parties of the ceasefire agreement signed in London last Friday, Lord Carrington's letter said the parties could no longer blame each other. 'No one is blameless,' it said. In a television interview, Lord Carrington confirmed earlier statements that he would change his approach to the peace talks. If the warring parties wanted to come, he would try to focus their attention on working out constitutional arrangements, rather than first trying to negotiate a ceasefire agreement. Referring indirectly to the criticism expressed by Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, of the lack of co-ordination between the EC and the UN peacekeeping and peacemaking operations in Bosnia, Lord Carrington said he had no objection to a widening of the EC peace conference. It is understood that Mr Douglas Hurd, British foreign secretary and current president of the European Council, gave Mr Boutros Ghali an assurance, during talks in New York on Wednesday night, that a UN representative would be welcome to take part in any of the EC-sponsored peace talks. However, in New York, a UN spokesman emphasised that opposed to the EC peace conference's plan, endorsed by the Security Council, to place under UN supervision heavy weapons held by the factions in Bosnia-Hercegovina. The Security Council last night scheduled further private consultations on the question. Meanwhile, Serb irregulars continued to battle with Bosnian Moslem and Croat forces in Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, and throughout the republic. The Serbs are trying to wrest from mainly Croat forces the control of the key towns of Derventa, Bosanski Brod and Brcko, northern Bosnia, to secure a corridor linking Serb-controlled territories. Moslem defenders of Gorazde, eastern Bosnia, again sent radio messages appealing to the outside world for help. Some 70,000 people have been trapped in the city, the last Moslem stronghold in Bosnia, for two months. In Bonn, Chancellor Helmut Kohl said he had written to all his EC partners asking them to reconsider their reluctance to share the growing refugee problem equally among all 12 member states. He hit out at his European partners for being too slow to recognise breakaway Yugoslav republics last year, but stressed that no western state planned to send combat troops to end the bloodshed in the region and that the only hope for peace lay in political pressure. A Saudi Arabian aircraft yesterday delivered the kingdom's first load of food and medical supplies to the beleaguered Moslems of Bosnia-Hercegovina, Reuter reports from Jeddah. A Saudi defence ministry C-130 transport hurriedly delivered 50 tonnes of supplies and Dollars 27m in cash to Sarajevo, leaving as mortar shells exploded near the airport. Saudi Arabia plans to contribute 35 planeloads of supplies to the airlift.  The Financial Times   London Page 2  "

Mr Antonio Cardenal, known as Commander 'Jonas', was killed in El Salvador last week with 12 other guerrillas, in an ambush by a commando unit of the army's elite Atlacatl battalion, in what was considered a guerrilla-controlled area. The FMLN has angrily accused the government of killing 'Jonas' after he was taken prisoner and of trying to wreck the peace talks. An FMLN communique yesterday warned that guerrillas would launch similar attacks against army chiefs. It warned that any attempts by the army to push the FMLN out of territory it controls would be resisted. 'Jonas' was a member of the FMLN's political-diplomatic commission and was directly involved in earlier rounds of peace talks. He was Nicaraguan by birth, and a nephew of the Nicaraguan president Mrs Violeta Barrios de Chamorro. Several big issues are at stake in the negotiations, aimed at establishing a ceasefire by April 30. The FMLN wants the government to recognise its de facto control of some territory during a period of 'armed peace' which will lead to an eventual disarmament of the FMLN. It also wants steps on constitutional reforms and the creation of an commission to oversee the purging from the armed forces of officers linked to human rights abuses.

In the run-up to the tenth round of talks both the Palestinians and the Israelis have played down expectations of a breakthrough on a joint statement of principles on interim Palestinian self-rule. The Palestinian delegation, led by Mr Haidar Abdel-Shafi, is said to be deeply unhappy about the failure of US officials sponsoring the talks to provide concrete answers to a series of questions defining the extent of Palestinian autonomy to be granted over the occupied territories during an interim period. The Palestinian delegation has been in Washington since last week pressing the US State Department to clarify its position on questions central to the peace talks. Among issues presented by the Palestinians are whether the US views the territories as 'disputed' or 'occupied', how East Jerusalem would be governed during the interim and how Washington sees the linkage between an interim solution and a permanent settlement. The Palestinians said they failed to receive clear answers from the US administration and yesterday it was unclear whether Mr Abdel-Shafi would attend this morning's session or merely send a symbolic delegation. In Jerusalem Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, said that he expected no breakthrough in Washington but he said he believed that Israel and some of the Arab states had passed the point of no return in the negotiations. 'We are not ready for gestures. The period of confidence-building measures is over,' Mr Rabin reportedly told a parliamentary committee yesterday. Without any progress on the Palestinian track, negotiations between Jerusalem and its Arab neighbours Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon are unlikely to make any headway in Washington. King Hussein of Jordan, who is due to meet President Bill Clinton on Friday, last week ruled out the possibility of signing any bilateral agreement until there is progress in Palestinian-Israeli talks. Palestinian and Arab delegates are pressing the US to take a more interventionist role to force concessions on the parties and ensure some progress is made before the tenth round ends in three weeks.

The two sides  exchanged views on bilateral relations and international issues  of common concern.    Qian Qichen said: The Chinese and Angolan peoples have  enjoyed a traditional friendship. Since the two countries  established diplomatic relations, their relations have developed  smoothly. China is willing to further enhance friendly relations  and cooperation with Angola. China has always paid close  attention to Angola's peace process, and supports the Angolan  Government's policy of national reconciliation and the efforts  it has made to achieve that goal. China sincerely hopes that  the peace talks in Angola will produce a final agreement at an  early date and will help realize domestic peace and stability.    He said: China has never interfered in Africa's internal  affairs and has done all it could to contribute to Africa's  development. China hopes that African countries will realize  peace and stability and develop good-neighborly and friendly  relations.    Qian pointed out: Big countries, instead of interfering in  Africa's internal affairs, should let African nations build  themselves according to their own situations. If big powers  really care about Africa, they should not fill out a  prescription and force Africa to accept it. They should offer  aid to Africa to promote its economic development.    Moura briefed Qian Qichen on the current situation in  Angola.  He expressed his thanks for the long-term political and  economic support that his country has received from the Chinese  Government and people. He said: During Angola's struggle for  national independence, the Angolan and Chinese people stood on  one side. Following major changes in the international  situation, the two peoples have continued to stand together.    Moura reaffirmed that Angola firmly adheres to its stand  that  there is only one China, and that it will never develop any  official relations with Taiwan. He expressed the belief that  economic relations and trade between the two countries will be  further enhanced after Angola has realized peace.     "

He also said that the contact group would meet in Washington  at the end of the week, the well-known contact group, which will  continue to consider the peace plan for Bosnia-Herzegovina. The  two cochairmen have just left Belgrade for Zvornik, where they  are to meet the leadership of the Serb republic and have  concrete talks. According to Lord Owen, he discussed  generalities with President Milosevic concerning the  establishment of peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the sanctions,  and he said that they would be in a package. He will discuss  concrete details with the leadership of the republic of Srpska.     "

Shamir and his aides are playing down the prospect that he will propose  dramatic initiatives when he speaks to President Bush. Israeli officials who  once promised that Shamir would deliver a bold new peace plan are now rejecting  the view that the meeting is pivotal.    Instead, they describe the visit as a ""consultation"" and shy away from giving  the impression that the Bush Administration, by holding separate talks with the  PLO, is in fact mediating between Israel and its longtime enemy.    Shamir's inner circle is upset by the persistence shown by U.S. Secretary of  State James A. Baker III not only in keeping up contacts with the PLO but in  suggesting that, some day, Israel itself may have to negotiate with the group.    Members of Shamir's Likud Party call Baker's approach the ""velvet hammer""  because at the same time that he pledges devotion to Israel, he tries to drive  home policies that Shamir opposes.    ""The United States is weaving iron chains around us. This is not good,"" Yosef  Ben-Aharon, Shamir's Cabinet secretary, said of Baker's moves. ""If we say that  Israel cannot talk to the PLO and the United States keeps talking to them, this  applies pressure on us. If this is the course that is going to be followed, we  are headed for a full-dress, head-on collision with the United States.    ""It was a big blunder to open talks with the PLO.""      Arafat Renounced Terrorism    Washington began talks with the PLO during the final weeks of the Reagan  Administration, after the PLO chairman, Yasser Arafat, publicly renounced the  use of terrorism and acknowledged Israel's right to exist. Baker maintained the  contact, despite Israel's objection that talks with the PLO are tantamount to  acceptance of the group's demand for an independent Palestinian state.    But the American-PLO contact is not the only move that has upset the Shamir  government. Baker also has called for Shamir to show ""new dynamism"" and  suggested that Israel take one or more steps to ease tensions in the occupied  West Bank and Gaza Strip. Suggestions published so far include the release of  Palestinians who are in jail without trial, the reopening of Arab schools and  the withdrawal of troops from cities and towns in the occupied land.    On Thursday, a senior Israeli official sharply turned down such calls: ""The  Americans don't need our gestures. They know we want peace.""    Shamir also rejects two other basics of American policy: that Israel should  prepare to give up occupied land for peace and should stop building settlements  in the West Bank and Gaza.    ""In my opinion, the settlements have nothing to do with the peace process,"" the  senior official said. Israel has built 137 settlements since occupying the West  Bank and Gaza after the 1967 Six-Day War. About 70,000 Israelis live in the  enclaves among 1.7 million Arabs.    As for land-for-peace, Shamir recently told Israel Television: ""I do not  believe that a formula of this type must be sought.""    Although Shamir is keeping his exact plans for Washington quiet -- he has  refused to have an open discussion in his Cabinet about his present policy --  he is expected to bring ""ideas"" that turn on ways to get talks off the ground  without the PLO, his associates say.      Variation of Camp David    The ideas all turn on some variation of the 1978 Camp David accords which call  for a period of autonomy in the West Bank and Gaza before a permanent peace  solution is worked out.    As a start, Shamir hopes to organize a meeting among Israel, Egypt and the  United States, in an echo of Camp David. The three countries would organize  some way of finding Palestinian ""interlocutors"" to carry on further talks.    Shamir would prefer such an appointed Palestinian delegation so that Israel  would have a veto, senior officials say. If that idea falls flat -- and it has  already been rejected by Egypt as well as any recognized Palestinian leader  inside or outside of the West Bank and Gaza -- Shamir is also willing to  consider some kind of election.    ""It's an acceptable principle to us,"" a senior official said.    One idea being floated is a vote for mayors of cities and towns as a means of  getting a Palestinian representation, senior officials say; Shamir is said to  be ""open"" to letting known PLO sympathizers join in, although he has stopped  short of declaring himself openly on this point.    Municipal elections exclude large rural areas, raising the question of whether  the vote is meant to find negotiators, or merely administrators to take office  when autonomy is in place.    In any case, talks with Palestinians, elected or otherwise, would lead to the  establishment of autonomous areas, with the final status left for talks to take  place within five years, Shamir says.    Shamir insists that Israel must maintain control over the West Bank and Gaza  Strip when a permanent solution is worked out.    The prime minister's unwavering demand to keep all the land puts him not only  at loggerheads with American policy, but with members of his own government,  which is an uneasy coalition led by Shamir's Likud Party, with the more dovish  Labor Party as a junior partner.    Labor favors the formula of giving up land for peace, and Defense Minister  Yitzhak Rabin, the party's No. 2 official, has outlined his own plan that would  permit area-wide elections on the West Bank and Gaza to form a Palestinian  peace delegation.    Victory by PLO sympathizers would be tolerated, Rabin has said. Land turned  loose at the close of talks would be ceded to neighboring Jordan.    Rabin opposes an independent Palestinian state or direct talks with the PLO.    Israeli observers view Shamir's trip as a holding action designed to buy time  until either the U.S. dialogue with the PLO runs out of steam or the Arab  uprising on the West Bank and Gaza fades. Both would reduce pressure on Israel.    ""Shamir will try to avoid confrontation with Washington. As long as he feels  that relations with the United States are not hurt badly, he will stand fast.  Shamir believes time is on his side,"" said Arye Naor, now Cabinet secretary and  a former aide to Likud Prime Minister Menachem Begin.    Added Shlomo Avineri, a political scientist and former Foreign Ministry  official: ""Shamir has two contradictory items on his Washington agenda -- to  stick to his old ideas and avoid a clash with Washington. To square all this,  he has to use new rhetoric. He must talk the language of elections and say  something like 'Everything is up for grabs.'    ""That way, at least, he can win time. If Bush doesn't like what he says, Shamir  can promise to come back with something else.""    These observers view Baker's step-by-step approach as having a wearing, if not  immediate effect on the status quo in Israel.    ""The United States has a strong impact on the debate within Israel,"" Avineri  commented, noting that the U.S. decision to talk with the PLO encouraged  Israeli doves and even some members of the Likud Party to consider such an  eventuality.    Added Naor: ""In a sense, Baker and Bush must go over Shamir's head and try to  convince Israeli public opinion that in the long term, giving up something is  in Israel's interest.""    Direct U.S. pressure is unwise, the experts concur. Shamir, they point out, is  a product of tragedies inflicted on Jews before and during World War II; he is  already prone to distrust the outside world.    ""For Shamir, standing up to pressure is not a catastrophe. It's what he  expects. It's his fate and the fate of the Jewish people,"" said Yaron Ezrahi, a  political theorist at Hebrew University. ""Baker would do well to present  himself as a victim of public opinion that is beginning to look unfavorably on  Israel. Let Shamir draw his own conclusions.""    Open threats to cut aid may not be realistic, the experts note. Much of the  economic aid goes to paying off Israel's foreign debt, much of it to American  banks. Military aid is seen in Washington as benefiting both sides and is  probably immune from significant cutbacks.    ""If America had a credible arsenal of threats, it would have used them long  ago,"" said Avineri.      THE MIDDLE EAST AGENDA    Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, due in Washington on Monday, has called the  Camp David autonomy formula outdated, considers U.S. opening dialogue with PLO  a triumph of Egypt's own diplomacy.    Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, due in Washington on Thursday, is  expected to offer an array of tentative, mostly old ideas to open Middle East  talks, with an eye to reversing recent U.S. moves.    King Hussein of Jordan, due in Washington on April 19, could still be a pivotal  figure in any Middle East talks, especially if the ""Jordanian option"" of a  joint Jordan-Palestinian delegation should be revived.

Jordan, meanwhile, said it would sign a preliminary peace agreement with Israel in Washington. At PLO headquarters in Tunis, Mr Yassir Abed-Rabbo, an executive committee member, said the accord could be signed within days and would be agreed before the signing of an Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement. Mr Shimon Peres, Israel's foreign minister, shared the optimism and said Israel was ready to sign a recognition agreement immediately the PLO agreed to annul its charter calling for the violent annihilation of the Jewish state. Mr Peres, who arrives in Brussels today to lobby EC officials for aid to Palestinians, also said that the accord was separate and independent from a peace deal with Palestinians on interim self-rule. He said the Israeli-Palestinian declaration of principles on self-rule for 1.9m Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, including Israeli military withdrawal from Gaza and the West Bank town of Jericho, 'stands on its own legs' and was not dependent on a recognition deal. In Amman, Mr Abdul Salam al-Majali, the Jordanian prime minister, said he expected a Jordanian-Israeli declaration of principles to be signed during the of Middle East peace negotiations in Washington. He said an 'agenda' between Jordan and Israel had been near completion for months but the Jordanian government had held back from signing to allow the Palestinians time to agree on an initial settlement. ""Aside from certain matters concerning language, we are likely to agree on an agenda this time round,' he said. The agenda - which contains the framework for a peace agreement - is believed to include the return by Israel of two strips of land and increased Jordanian water rights from the Jordan and Yarmouk rivers. It also outlines the right of return of an estimated 100,000 of Palestinian refugees who fled to Jordan after the 1967 war when Israel seized the West Bank. In Jerusalem. Mr Peres agreed that a Jordanian agreement could be signed 'tomorrow' and said the last Israeli-Jordanian rounds of talks had discussed only minor details. The rapidly developing Israeli-Palestinian-Jordanian breakthrough showed signs of triggering possible progress in the two other tracks of the Middle East peace process - the Israeli-Syrian and Israeli-Lebanese talks. A PLO official said Spain was hosting secret talks among the three parties and that a draft Israeli-Syrian agreement on Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Golan Heights in return for full peace was close to completion. However, Israel and Syria denied the claim. Mr Peres clarified the timetable for the 'Gaza-Jericho' peace accord. He said a signing ceremony and approval by Israel's parliament would take place within two weeks. A joint committee would then iron out outstanding issues and the plan would then be implemented within four months.   Countries:-  ILZ  Israel, Middle East.

He added that the Palestinians do not support such  acts, and make every effort to put end to violence in the  region. The remarks were made after the Palestinian military  delegation held a meeting with Yasir 'Arafat in Cairo.    Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres has said that no one can  guarantee that the attack in 'Afula will be the last. At the  same time, every effort will be made to cut off the arms of the  murderers and harm the terror organization which aspires to  murder all that is good in the Middle East. Minister Peres  further said that grave incidents had been expected, but the  attack in 'Afula was graver than could be expected. He added  that the government will make security-related decisions, and  rejected the opposition parties' demand that a commission of  inquiry be set up to investigate the incident. Such murders  took place when the Likud was in power, and even before the  peace talks started, Peres said.    [In a live telephone interview on Tel Aviv IDF Radio in  Hebrew at 1400 GMT on 6 April, Foreign Minister Peres says: ""I  do not believe that Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] asks or  needs 'Arafat's permission to carry out such attacks. For the  time being, 'Arafat is not on the ground here. When he enters  the region, we will examine his conduct in the region under his  jurisdiction."" Asked about the opposition demand to suspend the  negotiations with the PLO in the wake of the attack, he said:  ""I see no connection between the two issues.""]    Minister Yosi Sarid said that the circumstances of the  attack  in 'Afula will be thoroughly studied. He rejected the demands  that the peace talks be suspended claiming that the terrorists  should not be given a prize for their acts. At the same time,  he said, we must fight terrorism to the end.    Deputy Agriculture Minister Walid Sadiq condemned the grave  attack in 'Afula, and called for restraint. Deputy Health  Minister Nayif Musaliha said that the terrorists intend to  murder the peace process and the relations between Jews and  Arabs in Israel.    Knesset Member [MK] Yosi Katz, deputy chairman of the Labor  faction, said that the bloody attack proves that the government  must go on with the peace process, and not be deterred by  attempts by extremists to torpedo it.    Meretz faction Chairman Ran Kohen called on the prime  minister and the PLO head not to retreat, and to speed up the  exit of Israelis from the Gaza Strip and Jericho.    HADASH [Democratic Front for Peace and Equality] faction  Chairman Tawfiq Zayyad condemned the attack, saying that it  poisons the atmosphere and harms the political process.    The National Religious Party said that the 'Afula attack is  the outcome of the Rabin government's policy of groveling.    Moledet said that the 'Afula massacre is an indication of  what is to happen once the recipe for peace, prepared by the  government and the PLO, is implemented.    Our correspondent Hayim Hecht reports that MK Ravitz of the  United Torah Jewry demanded that the prime minister set up a  state commission of inquiry to examine the events that led to  the attack in 'Afula.    Likud MK 'Ovadya Eli, who used to be 'Afula mayor, demanded  that peace talks be stopped at once, and that their continuation  be made conditional on a Palestinian commitment to prevent  additional acts of terror from taking place.

0,FT941-15004 ,"FT941-15004 _AN-EARDHAB4FT 940118   FT  18 JAN 94 / Sinn Fein waits for clarification      By DAVID OWEN   Sinn Fein will make no formal response to the Downing Street declaration until it has received the clarification it has demanded from London and Dublin. Mr Tom Hartley, Sinn Fein's national chairman, gave the first explicit confirmation of this stance yesterday, as the party used a Westminster press conference to publish its version of the contacts between the British government and republican leaders. Mr Hartley said: 'Sinn Fein has actually sent a letter to John Major asking for clarification. I think it is obvious Sinn Fein will not make its decision until it gets that clarification.' His remarks leave the UK-Irish peace initiative at an apparent impasse: London has said repeatedly that no clarification of the joint declaration is necessary. Unveiling a dense 47-page document giving details of the dialogue between Sinn Fein and the British government, Mr Hartley also revealed the principles enshrined in the so-called Hume-Adams accord. Mr Hartley referred to three principles agreed by Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, and Mr John Hume, leader of the mainly Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party, during secret discussions last year. These were: That there should be no 'internal' solution (ie within the 'six counties') to the Irish problem. That there should be a right of national self-determination for the people of Ireland as a whole. That it was 'desirable' for unionists to be on board. Speaking of 'a period of political flux,' Mr Hartley said he doubted the Irish situation would ever revert to that before Hume-Adams. 'I think there is a momentum about Ireland now,' he said. 'In a sense, the logjam has been broken.' In its version of the contacts with the British government - which it said stretched back over 20 years - Sinn Fein again insisted that last year's series of messages was initiated by London. An introduction to the dossier - which claims there are further textual errors and bogus messages in London's version of the exchanges - states: 'In the early part of 1993, the British government proposed a series of meetings with Sinn Fein, arguing that an intensive round of such meetings would result in Irish republicans being convinced that armed struggle was no longer necessary. 'They requested a two-to-three week undeclared suspension of operations by the Irish Republican Army to facilitate this. Sinn Fein sought and gained such a commitment from the IRA.' Downing Street last night attacked Sinn Fein for trying to divert attention from its failure to embrace the UK-Irish peace process.   Countries:-  IEZ  Ireland, EC.

The reason for this is the current  situation in the region and that of the peace process. The  peace process is still at square one because of the intransigent  Israeli position.    AL-BA'TH notes that the two presidents discussed  developments  in the Arab arena, the peace process, and the obstacles placed  by Israel in the wayh of peace.    The Arabs, Syria in particular, have done everything  possible, in line with the resolutions of international  legitimacy, so the peace process will achieve its objectives.  President Mubarak has stressed that the Geneva summit between  Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clinton gave great momentum to  the peace process. However, the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre  obstructed this process.    AL-BA'TH concludes: Israel does not want peace. It only  seeks agreements, such as the Gaza-Jericho accord, because such  agreements achieve its dreams. At any rate, Syria will continue  to work seriously to achieve a just and comprehensive peace in  the region, but for peace to prevail Syria must restore its  territory in full.     "
0,FT932-7686 ,"FT932-7686 _AN-DEWAFAAIFT 930522   FT  22 MAY 93 / Ireland's president to take tea at the palace      By RALPH ATKINS   AFTER seven decades during which British monarchs seemed to overlook the existence of the neighbouring Irish Republic, the royal frost has now thawed a little. Ireland's President Mary Robinson has been invited to London for tea with the Queen. Buckingham Palace did not announce next Thursday's visit, but it confirmed leaks from Dublin. It will be a private visit, a courtesy call, a palace official said yesterday. There is no question of a state occasion. The Queen went to Germany last year, hoping to heal wounds of the second world war. She visited Spain in 1988, shrugging off the UK's territorial dispute over Gibraltar. In the US, once a British colony, the Queen draws crowds. The French have been known to wave flags for her. But historical divisions between Britain and Ireland live on. No British king or queen has met an Irish president. The last monarch to visit southern Ireland was Edward VII in 1903 - almost 20 years before the partitioning of Ulster and the creation of an Irish Free State. Next week's visit illustrates the improvement in UK-Irish government relations which - even as late as the 1980s - were punctuated by ill-tempered outbursts over the extradition of Irish terrorists, or the quality of British justice. The neighbourliness is not reflected, however, in Northern Ireland. Yesterday local election results in the province set back hopes of Irish and British ministers that 'round-table' political talks on the province's political future would be re-started soon. The better-than-expected performance of the Rev Ian Paisley's hard-line Democratic Unionist party will only encourage him in his pledge not to resume negotiations until Ireland compromises on its territorial claim on the north. Also faring well was Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA which is excluded from talks by both the Irish and the British governments. The territorial dispute over Northern Ireland remains the unofficial reason why diplomats in London and Dublin continue to advise their respective heads of state against a formal meeting. But there are, perhaps, personal memories too; the Queen's cousin Lord Mountbatten was murdered by the IRA in 1979.

It says: It  has been proven beyond a doubt that when there is a unified Arab  position on basic pan-Arab issues, the Arab nation can score  major achievements. It has also been proven that any penetration  of the Arab position from any direction for any reason will  definitely harm everyone. This is absolutely clear from the Oslo  agreement and what has followed.    AL-BA'TH adds: Had Arab coordination remained as it had been  at the beginning of the peace talks itwould certainly have been  in the interest of the Arabs and, consequently, in the interest  of the establishment of a just, comprehensive peace.    AL-BA'TH indicates that what matters now is not when the  peace talks will resume, but how Israel will comply with the  resolutions of international legitimacy so that the peace  process will be brought to a successful end leading to a just,  comprehensive peace, which is needed in the region. The paper  believes that the responsibility for achieving this lies with  the cosponsors of the peace process, specifically the United  States, being the initiator of the peace process.    AL-BA'TH stresses Syria's readiness to continue peace  efforts. It indicates that Syria has offered all that is  possible to ensure the continuation of that process in order to  arrive at a comprehensive solution.    Concluding, AL-BA'TH says: When Syria called for a meeting  of the Arab parties directly concerned with the peace process,  it did so out of its faith in joint Arab action and its absolute  realization that coordination and faithful commitment will  thwart any Israeli attempt to effect another penetration like  the Oslo agreement. Besides, coordination in itself can achieve  at least a minimum level of Arab aspirations.    In an editorial on the UN Security Council resolution on the  Hebron massacre and the chance that the resolution has provided  for the resumption of the peace talks, TISHRIN says:  Undoubtedly, UN Security Council Resolution 904 on the Ibrahimi  Mosque massacre has provided a new opportunity to resume the  peace talks. In turn, this will boost the international  arrangements and measures to protect our Palestinian Arab people  in the occupied territories, and will prevent the recurrence of  spiteful crimes and massacres by the settlers with the support  of the Israeli Army against the Palestinian citizens in the  occupied territories.    TISHRIN continues: The Hebron massacre and the subsequent  confrontations and events have proven to the entire world the  need to end the Israeli occupation and to arrive at a just,  comprehensive peace in accordance with the Madrid conference  formula away from any procrastination and obstacles. Thus,  Israel must adopt practical measures to protect and ensure the  security of the Palestinians. We also demand that it disarm the  settlers, give up its provocative and extortionist stands, and  seriously contribute toward activating the peace process by  recognizing the facts and objectives of this process and  responding to the UN resolutions, the Madrid conference formula,  and the principle of trading land for peace.    TISHRIN adds: Undoubtedly, the chances that were provided  for the peace process, particularly during the talks, have been  greatly narrowed after the Hebron massacre. Safeguarding the  peace process and extricating it from the impasse to which it  has been driven requires, more than ever before, a public  Israeli acknowledgement in advance that only a full withdrawal  from the occupied Arab territories can ensure the achievement of  a just, comprehensive peace and regional security, stability,  and calm.    TISHRIN stresses Syria's eagerness to continue coordination  among the Arab parties to the peace process and its call for a  meeting for consultations prior to the resumption of the talks.  The paper explains that the Arabs, especially Syria, have  always been advocates of right and justice, seriously and  honestly working to achieve a just, comprehensive peace.  However, Israel has met all this with nothing but more  maneuvers and circumvention of the objectives of peace. Had  Israel been, like the Arabs, serious at the Madrid conference  and had it showed commitment to the formula of that conference,  the Hebron massacre would not have taken place and all this  violence and terrorism would not have prevailed in the occupied  territories, which have turned into battlefields in which Arab  citizens are being slaughtered by the gunfire of the occupiers.  Nor would southern Lebanon have suffered destruction,  bombardment, and displacement of its population as a result of  the brutal Israeli aggressions.    Concluding, TISHRIN says: While awaiting the true and full  implementation of Resolution 904, it must be emphasized that  Israel is required, now more than ever before, to respond to all  bases and requirements of peace, headed by full withdrawal from  the occupied territories. Securing such an Israeli response is  both an international and a U.S. responsibility.     "

Hundreds of settlers immediately took to the streets of the West Bank in protest, blocking main roads, burning Arab cars and wrecking a number of Palestinian shops, and members of the parliamentary opposition called for the suspension of peace talks with the Palestinian Liberation Organisation. These calls were ignored by the government, which said last night that the negotiations would resume today in Cairo. The talks, held at the Egyptian beach resort of Taba, were suspended last Tuesday by the PLO negotiators, who claimed that Israel was offering only a redeployment of forces in Gaza and Jericho rather than full withdrawal. Quoting the outline treaty which frames the negotiations, Mr Nabil Shaath, who will head the Palestinian delegation at today's talks, said in Cairo yesterday that the treaty 'says that redeployment takes place in addition to the withdrawal in Gaza and Jericho. That's very clear.' The talks would focus on differences of interpretation surrounding Israeli undertakings. This week's meeting, however, appears to represent talks about talks rather than a full resumption of the Taba negotiations. Yesterday's attack, for which the Hamas Islamic fundamentalist movement claimed responsibility, killed Mr Haim Ayubi, a 30-year-old father of four. He was the eleventh Israeli to be killed by Palestinians since the PLO autonomy accord two months ago. He died early yesterday morning, when the car he was driving was riddled with bullets fired from a passing vehicle. His passenger, Rabbi Haim Druckman, a former National Religious Party member of parliament and a leading settler idealogue, was hit in the arm and shoulder. The settlers were last night laying plans to block all main roads in the occupied territories this morning. Castigating the government for failing to protect them, a settlers' spokesman vowed that the occupied territories 'would roar and tremble' until the attacks ceased. Israeli newspapers yesterday carried reports of progress in the country's talks with Jordan, with claims that Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, held nine hours of talks last week in Amman with King Hussein, that the two men initialled various 'understandings', but that Jordan would not sign a full peace treaty with Israel until the Syrians were also ready to sign.

It emerged yesterday that Mr William Flyn, president of Mutual America, one of the biggest US insurance companies, has renewed contact with Sinn Fein while on a visit this week to Dublin and Belfast. Mr Flyn is part of a delegation of Irish-American businessmen who have been discussing investment oppor-tunities on both sides of the Irish border with government officials and local enterprises. He is understood to have used the opportunity of the visit to try to persuade Sinn Fein of the growing support within the Irish-American community for the UK-Irish peace initiative. Mr Flyn was one of the central figures behind the controversial visit of Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, to New York in February. His invitation to Mr Adams to speak at a conference on Northern Ireland led to President Bill Clinton granting the Sinn Fein leader a visa against the advice of British and US state department officials. Mr Flyn believes the visit helped strengthen Mr Adams's influence within the IRA in support of the peace initiative and exposed republican militants to the moderation of most Irish Americans. He said yesterday that continuing paramilitary violence in Northern Ireland remained the 'biggest obstacle' to increased US investment in the province, but he felt 'encouraged' about the prospects for peace. Northern Ireland officials regard the US as important to the local economy - 38 US companies operate in the province employing about 9 per cent of the manufacturing workforce, much of it in Roman Catholic areas. The visit by US company executives follows a plea by Mr John Major, the prime minister, during his visit to the US in March that the influence of corporate Irish-America be brought to bear on producing peace in Northern Ireland.

By RICHARD BOUDREAUX, TIMES STAFF WRITER      SAN JOSE, Costa Rica      El Salvador's new government outlined a plan Monday to end nearly 10 years of  guerrilla war but offered Marxist rebels few of the political changes or human  rights guarantees they seek in return for laying down their weapons.    In its first peace proposal since taking office June 1, the right-wing  government of President Alfredo Cristiani called for a cessation of hostilities  within two days and the return of the guerrillas to civilian life by Jan. 15  under international supervision.    The proposal, made here in peace talks with the guerrillas, addressed two rebel  demands. It offered a multi-party ""review"" of electoral laws and measures to  ""perfect"" the justice system. The rebels want a new Supreme Court, a new  attorney general and early legislative elections, before their scheduled March  1991 date.    Guerrilla leaders quickly belittled the plan, saying it ignored entirely their  demands for investigations of right-wing death squad murders, a purge of  anti-democratic elements from the armed forces and specific steps to punish  military officers who abuse human rights. It also rejected any negotiations  over the size of a peacetime army.    The government offered instead to set up a joint commission with the rebels to  oversee the disarmament process and ""protect the life and the physical and  moral integrity"" of former rebels.    In addition, the proposed accord would be supervised by delegates of the United  Nations, Organization of American States and the Roman Catholic Church.    ""This is a serious, responsible proposal that seeks a global solution to the  conflict,"" said Oscar Alfredo Santamaria, the Salvadoran justice minister,  during an evening break on the first of two scheduled days of talks. ""It  deserves a serious response.""    Minutes later, the chief rebel negotiator, Joaquin Villalobos, faced reporters  and branded the proposal ""absurd, illogical and inflexible.""    ""It is a plan that asks us to make an unconditional surrender and accept the  country as it is,"" he said.    However, talks on the proposal, and a rebel peace plan made last month, resumed  late Monday evening. Rebel negotiators said it was expected that the two sides'  opening positions would be far apart and expressed guarded hope for closing the  gap.    The Cristiani government and the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front met  for the first time Sept. 13-15 in Mexico City and agreed to try to end the  fighting ""by political means in the shortest time possible"" through monthly  negotiations.    This first round of substantive talks at the suburban monastery of the Roman  Catholic Clarist Sisters. was mediated by Catholic leaders from El Salvador and  witnessed by U.N. and OAS representatives.    In a sign of the pressure on both sides to end the war, Costa Rican President  Oscar Arias Sanchez met separately with each, then challenged them publicly to  ""bury the past.""    ""Seven million Salvadorans have turned their eyes toward you, with optimism and  faith,"" said the 1987 Nobel Peace Prize winner. ""You do not want to leave here  as accomplices of more war.""    The conflict has left at least 70,000 dead, most of them civilians killed by  right-wing death squads.    With that in mind, the rebels have made prosecution of such violations the key  condition for disarming. Their plan calls for a cease-fire by Nov. 15 in return  for reforming the judiciary and the army to end rights abuses. The rebels would  then disarm by Jan. 15 and turn into a political party.    The government proposal calls for agreements on undefined ""measures to  strengthen respect for human rights.""    ""The impunity of those who kill and torture has to end,"" said Villalobos.    The onset of talks appears to have sharpened the conflict, adding to a climate  of distrust. More than 70 combatants on both sides have been killed since the  rebels ended an 11-day unilateral truce Sept. 23, after the government began  arresting and beating leftist union leaders and other rebel supporters.    Since taking office June 1, Cristiani has surprised his critics just by his  willingness to talk. But opposition in the military and his right-wing  Nationalist Republican Alliance appears has given the rebels the edge in a  propaganda war.    ""We all want peace to come to our country right now,"" Cristiani said Sunday in  a speech televised in El Salvador. ""But 10 years of fratricidal conflict is  difficult to solve.

0,FT943-4437 ,"FT943-4437 _AN-EIICUAACFT 940909   FT  09 SEP 94 / Loyalist gunmen set out terms for ceasefire: Statement raises hopes of peace      By KEVIN BROWN and JIMMY BURNS      LONDON, BELFAST   Northern Ireland's loyalist paramilitaries yesterday set out their terms for an end to terrorism in response to the IRA's ceasefire declaration, raising the prospect of a permanent end to 25 years of political violence in the province. The Combined Loyalist Military Command, which represents the Ulster Volunteer Force and the Ulster Freedom Fighters, the two main terror groups, stopped short of offering an immediate cessation of violence. But it promised 'a meaningful contribution towards peace' once it is certain that the IRA ceasefire is permanent, that the Irish National Liberation Army has ended violence; that no secret deals have been struck with the republicans; and that Ulster's position within the UK is assured. The statement was dismissed as 'inadequate' by the Northern Ireland Office. Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, said the IRA 'has had the courage to take the initiative. The government and the loyalists have not'. Alderman Hugh Smyth, the Lord Mayor of Belfast, said the statement suggested that a ceasefire was possible if the loyalists received the right answers from the government and republicans. The loyalist command gave no timetable for a ceasefire. It said the decision would depend on the implications of the framework document for Northern Ireland's future being drawn up by the British and Irish governments as part of the peace process, which is unlikely to be published for several weeks. 'Change, if any, can only be honourable after dialogue and agreement. It is important that patience is shown to this body given the gravity of the debate required,' the command said. The announcement followed assurances to unionists from Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, that the number of British troops in Northern Ireland would not be reduced until the government was sure that terrorism had ended. 'The crucial requirement is to ensure the security of the people of Northern Ireland is fully protected, and that is a judgment that has to be looked at very, very carefully,' Mr Rifkind said, during a visit to Berlin. He said a 'gradual reduction' in the military presence would only happen when violence had ended for a 'considerable' time. 'I am not envisaging any immediate changes of that kind'. His comments contrasted sharply with Wednesday's announcement by Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, that security was being scaled down. Troops have discarded steel helmets in favour of berets. Mr Martin McGuinness, a member of Sinn Fein's executive, said Mr Rifkind's comments were 'particularly unimaginative and arrogant'. The presence of British soldiers was 'particularly provocative at this time'. Republican sources said that the combination of the government's cautious approach to security and the loyalist terrorists' delay in declaring a ceasefire would put pressure on the internal discipline of the IRA. However, security sources believe that the ceasefire will hold as long as the peace initiative progresses at government level. They also believe that loyalist violence can be contained. A source close to the loyalist paramilitaries said that the combined command's statement was part of a two-track strategy. The source said that loyalist terrorists wanted to play a part in discussions on Ulster's future, while leaving the option of violence open in case unionists felt threatened by the IRA.

These facts are among the bases on which the Middle East peace  process was established when Syria accepted this process and  gave an opportunity for its launching through the Madrid  conference.    AL-BA'TH explains that among these facts is Syria's care for  continuing the peace process and its appreciation of the U.S.  efforts designed to achieve a just and comprehensive solution to  the Arab-Israeli conflict. The paper asserts that achieving  this objective is linked to the commitment to the bases and  principles on which the peace process was established. This  process emanates from the resolutions of both the United Nations  and international legitimacy, led by the commitment to the  land-for-peace principle.    The paper holds Israel responsible for the stumbling  bilateral negotiations. Israel has not ceased its attempts to  circumvent the peace process, the paper says. These Israeli  positions prove to everyone that Israel's acceptance of the  peace initiative was formal in the first place. This acceptance  also conceals intentions that reject a just solution.    The paper points out that Israel always seeks to depart from  the bases and substance of the peace process, and to shirk the  commitment to the initiative which was accepted on the Arab,  regional, and international levels. This was confirmed  yesterday through the [Israeli] replies Christopher carried to  Damascus.    AL-BA'TH stresses that Israel is the only party that is  undermining the peace initiative and threatening regional  stability through intransigent positions and dictates that are  not in harmony with the substance of the peace process.    Concluding its comment, AL-BA'TH wonders: To what extent can  Israel continue its refusal to respond to both the international  community and the cosponsors of the peace conference? The near  future, however, may answer this question.    Under the headline ""Israel Is Undermining the Peace  Efforts,""  the newspaper TISHRIN says: After he was briefed on the outcome  of Christopher's talks in Israel, President Hafiz al-Asad  explained that differences between the Syrian and Israeli  positions are wide and great because the Israeli side departed  from the bases and requirements of the peace process.    Discussing the Israeli positions based on intransigence and  procrastination, the paper adds: The rulers of Israel have  foiled all efforts designed to remove the peace talks from their  deadlock. The paper explains that Syria worked for a real and  substantial launching of the peace process, and also supported  the U.S. Administration's efforts designed to place the peace  process on the right path.    TISHRIN continues: In brief, the Rabin government wants to  annex the territories. Thus, this government's talk about peace  is no more than a cheap maneuver designed to mislead world  public opinion and create a false optimism that the peace  process is achieving progress. The paper notes that Syria  absolutely believes in peace and that it continues to make every  possible effort to promote the peace process. The paper  emphasizes that Syria adheres to regaining the entire Golan and  other occupied territories and to Israel's withdrawal to the 4  June 1967 borders. It is not a Syrian tradition to sell out an  iota of national soil or any Arab right. This is because peace  should be just and comprehensive.    TISHRIN points out that the proposed Israeli settlements are  actually a consecration of occupation and an open disregard of  both the Security Council resolutions and the international  community's principles and charters.    Concluding, TISHRIN says: Peace can be achieved by resorting  to the international law and not by entrenching and spreading  the law of the jungle. The rulers of Israel should realize that  all their alleged peace plans would fail because Syria is the  Arabs' conscience and also because the Arabs will only accept  what Syria accepts.    Under the headline ""Complete Withdrawal First,"" the  newspaper AL-THAWRAH says: At a time when Syria showed full  cooperation with both the U.S. initiative and efforts designed  to promote the peace process in implementation of the  resolutions of international legitimacy, Israel showed much  disregard of international principles, UN charters, and the  legitimacy of the relevant UN resolutions rejecting the Israeli  occupation.    AL-THAWRAH adds: Despite the apparent future difficulties  and traps facing the Cairo agreement and obstructing its  implementation, it seems Israel has not yet learned the lesson  that lame peace settlements cannot make a durable peace, that  peace does not mean there is a winner or a loser, and that peace  does not imply concluding cheap deals based on bargains.    The paper says all observers have no difficulty in  discovering that the real Israeli position is pushing the peace  process toward numerous bargains, now that Israel has placed  obstacles and demonstrated intransigence about this process.  The paper explains that there is a great difference between  someone who wants a complete, just, and comprehensive peace, and  someone who wants to tamper with the components of such a peace,  ridicules the resolutions of international legitimacy, and  discounts the international will on the other.    The paper adds: Christopher's regional tour has shown that  differences [between Syria and Israel] are still wide because  the Israeli position departs from the bases and requirements of  the peace process launched in Madrid.    AL-THAWRAH points out that Syria cares for the continuation  of the peace process. As President Hafiz al-Asad asserted, the  objective is to achieve a just and comprehensive solution in  accordance with both the international resolutions and the  land-for-peace principle.    Concluding, AL-THAWRAH notes: As President al-Asad said,  Syria adheres to the pillars of the peace process, which is  based on the Security Council resolutions. These resolutions  stipulate full Israeli withdrawal to the 4 June 1967 borders in  order to achieve a just and comprehensive peace in the region.  Thus, complete Israeli withdrawal is the first and foremost  priority under all circumstances.     "

During  this visit, a Russian-Palestinian agreement of cooperation in  the cultural and educational field was signed. A detailed  discussion took place in Moscow on matters related to the  development of the peace process in the Middle East,  particularly the situation surrounding the Palestinian-Israeli  talks. A great attention was devoted to the development of  Russian-Palestinian relations.    Yasir 'Arafat expressed his deep concern over the state of  the Palestinian-Israeli talks since this situation has prevented  the signing of a final agreement on Palestinian autonomy in Gaza  and Jericho. Yasir 'Arafat also expressed his deep concern over  the increasing tension in the occupied territories where the  wave of violence and terrorism continues unabated. The  Palestinian leader hailed Russia's efforts in helping the  Palestinians and the Israelis reach an agreement on the  controversial issues on which the progress of the peace process  depends on the whole.    Yasir 'Arafat also welcomed Russia's active diplomatic role  in Middle Eastern affairs. The Russian side reiterated its firm  intention to help the PLO and Israel reach agreements on  Palestinian autonomy and continue efforts to ensure stability in  the occupied territories, establish peace, and guarantee  security in the Middle East.    The Russian Foreign Ministry considers Yasir 'Arafat's visit  useful. Mikhail Demurin said at his news briefing today that  Yasir 'Arafat's arrival in Russia was timely in view of the  current responsible and crucial phase in the Palestinian-Israeli  talks in particular and the peace process in the region in  general. He added: Russia is determined to play its role with  responsibility as one of the co-sponsors of the peace process.  We should bear this in mind when considering the Israeli prime  minister, Yitzhaq Rabin, is due to visit Moscow at the  invitation of President Boris Yeltsin. [end recording]    Then the Foreign Ministry spokesman replied to a question  from a Moscow reporter on the aid Russia will be offering  towards the creation of a Palestinian national police and a  security department and said:    [Begin Demurin recording] The talks between Yasir 'Arafat  and  Russian President Boris Yeltsin dealt with the possibility of  offering a material contribution from Russia towards the setting  up of structures for Palestinian autonomy, including a police  and security force. The Russian side has agreed in principle to  contribute by supplying the Palestinian police and security  force with equipment. It has also been agreed that the issue  will be examined in detail by experts as soon as possible. [end  recording]    Demurin added that Yasir 'Arafat had expressed his thanks  for  this position on ways to resolve one of the important issues of  Palestinian autonomy.     "

Mr Raul Domingas, the movement's chief negotiator at peace talks that have been going on for 18 months in Rome, said in London that Britain's military support for the Mozambique government was 'jeopardising all peace efforts'. Britain was supporting a 'party army', he said. The UK Foreign Office says that by the middle of next year up to 800 Mozambican soldiers will have been trained by Britain. Mr Domingas, visiting London at the invitation of a group of Conservative MPs, said the Rome talks had become deadlocked over the issue of the country's constitution which Renamo says should be reviewed and multi-party democracy institutionalised before a ceasefire could be agreed. He claimed that the country's new constitution, which commits formerly Marxist Mozambique to a mixed economy, freedom of the press, an independence judiciary and multi-party elections, was designed to defend Frelimo interests. Mr Domingas recognised his movement had an 'image problem' but denied reports of Renamo atrocities. Initially backed by Rhodesia and then South Africa, Renamo has reached the negotiating table by way of a harsh guerrilla campaign.  The Financial Times   London Page 4  "

[Jovanovic] I view them as encouraging, especially after  what has happened recently. Namely, it is evident that the  efforts to overcome the present situation and steer it back on  the negotiating path to find a solution by political means in  peace are again gaining in prominence. It is evident that Mr.  Akashi is a man of peace, dialogue, and negotiations, and not a  man of confrontation, threats, ultimatums, or punishment. On  the other hand, the entire situation, despite this tragic event,  contains elements of political dynamism [sentence as heard].  For example, Lord Owen and President Karadzic yesterday held  very enterprising talks about Sarajevo and its placement under  the UN administration without waiting for the final peace  settlement. On the other hand, there is talk about the  relaxation of the situation in Sarajevo itself, which is also  encouraging. There has been some progress in the talks  concerning Tuzla airport.    A meeting in Geneva is forthcoming at which, beside the  examination of the measures of trust, the issue of Sarajevo in  the above mentioned context should also be discussed. Finally,  a meeting of the neighboring countries of the former Yugoslavia  at a ministerial level will also probably take place, which  means that the political momentum has been preserved despite all  the temptations and we should expect further development in this  direction rather than in the direction of confrontation and  escalation of the war.    [Unidentified reporter, in English with superimposed  simultaneous translation into Serbo-Croatian] Mr. Minister how  do you assess the danger of air attacks on the Serbian positions  in Bosnia. Is this possible?    [Jovanovic, in English with superimposed simultaneous  translation into Serbo-Croatian] I believe that this is  possible in this war, but not likely, I hope, because everybody  is aware that this would not help in the present situation and  definitely would not assist the peace process. First of all,  the strain of the entire situation and the solution to the  crisis can only be seen within the framework of the peace  process and not in the possibility of escalating the conflict  further. Finally, political activities, a visit by Mr. Akashi  and the cochairmen not merely to Belgrade, but to some other  counties in this region are the best proof that the majority of  the international community believes that a political and not a  military solution is needed here. We are definitely inclined to  believe that the solution to the problem lies in the rejection  of the existing structure of political negotiations.    [Unidentified reporter, in English with superimposed  simultaneous translation into Serbo-Croatian] Do you foresee  what will happen in Geneva?    [Jovanovic, in English with superimposed simultaneous  translation into Serbo-Croatian] If it were up to us, peace can  take place anytime. The lack of peace will depend upon the side  that has been opposed to peace. Unfortunately, this side is  still not in a mood to assist the peace. They prefer to  obstruct the peace, however, there are chances that even this  side might turn more cooperative in comparison to the readiness  of the majority of the international community to assist the  peace process and not the continuation of the war.

Beilin said this was not a case of lip service, seeing that  it is inconceivable that Iranian officials should be given an  audience while Ron Arad is rotting in captivity.    During his three-day stay, Deputy Minister Beilin conferred  with top German Foreign Ministry officials, including the deputy  foreign minister.    Kinkel earlier conferred with Arab League Chairman  'Abd-al-Majid, who was visiting Bonn. He told Beilin that there  is a chance the Arab League might lift the boycott on subsidiary  companies, due to the positive developments in the peace  process, and that, contrary to his custom, 'Abd-al-Majid sounded  optimistic about the success of the peace process.

0,FT932-3070 ,"FT932-3070 _AN-DFPCDACNFT 930616   FT  16 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Warm summit may disguise cool relations round table - Ralph Atkins considers prospects for Ulster as the British and Irish leaders meet today      By RALPH ATKINS   TEMPERAMENTALLY similar and driven by the same politics of reasonableness, Mr John Major and Mr Albert Reynolds, prime minister of the Irish Republic, meet in London today to search once more for progress on Northern Ireland. Paradoxically, the closer the relationship between the two governments, the further apart seem the province's nationalist and unionist political parties. In spite of the governments' efforts, attempts to restart round-table political talks have stalled. Originally expected this month or next, a resumption is now unlikely before the autumn. Nobody in London or Dublin predicts a breakthrough today. In large part, the deadlock is due to Unionists' fears. Since the 1985 Anglo-Irish agreement allowed Dublin to have a small, but symbolically important say in the affairs of the north, Northern Ireland's majority population has seen the Conservative party drift away from the Unionist cause. British policy - that Northern Ireland is part of the UK as long a majority of its population wishes to stay - has not encouraged Unionists to believe its constitutional position is safe. The warmth between Mr Major and Mr Reynolds, with none of the testy inter-governmental exchanges that often characterised the 1980s, does not help calm suspicions. The hope that originally teased Unionists into the first set of round-table talks in 1990 - that the 1985 agreement would be torn up under a new London/Dublin/Belfast deal - has evaporated. Now the Rev Ian Paisley, populist Democratic Unionist party leader, is refusing to enter talks until the republic renounces its constitutional claim on the north. Mr Paisley is also irked by talks between Mr John Hume, leader of the mainly Roman Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party, and Sinn Fein. With local elections last month proving disappointing for the more moderate Ulster Unionist party, its leader Mr James Molyneaux has also hardened his position, complaining that uncertainty created by talks involving Dublin is costing lives. His argument has a robust logic; Loyalist terrorists are proving as deadly as the IRA, while last week's Opsahl report on the province, by an independent commission, said Britain's reluctance to set out a blueprint was adding to instability and distrust. British ministers respond that a history of failed political initiatives shows there is no alternative to the search for widely acceptable agreement from within the province. However Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, is drawing up 'sketch plans' for new arrangements in the province, to replace the present 'direct rule' from Westminster. The initiative, agreed against the advice of some in the Northern Ireland Office, followed the last intervention in Northern Ireland by Mr Major in April. Sir Patrick's colleagues believe he is philosophical about the intransigence of nationalists and Unionists, judging that solutions may only evolve over years, rather than months. In that long run, prime ministerial summits will not make much difference either. An extra Pounds 24m is to be spent on the economic regeneration programme in Belfast, Sir Patrick Mayhew said yesterday. The cash will allow 30 new schemes, including a crime-prevention project for north and west Belfast. It brings to Pounds 124m the amount set aside for the Making Belfast Work initiative aimed at boosting economic development and education in some of the city's most troubled and deprived areas.

0,FT932-11122 ,"FT932-11122 _AN-DEFCSAAPFT 930506   FT  06 MAY 93 / US and western allies fail to resolve their differences      By ROBERT MAUTHNER, Diplomatic Editor   THE US and its western allies yesterday were still at odds over what action to take if the Bosnian Serb assembly failed to give clear endorsement to the Vance-Owen peace plan, Mr Douglas Hurd, British foreign secretary, admitted. While not ruling out some kind of military action such as air strikes against Bosnian Serb supply lines, Mr Hurd said that talks last weekend with Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, had not resolved which particular option should be chosen. Mr Hurd, who was answering questions by members of the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, referred in particular to reservations by Britain and other countries about the preferred US option to lift the UN embargo on arms deliveries to Bosnia. Such a step 'runs the risk of inflaming the fighting and spreading the war,' he said. Britain and France, main contributors of troops to the UN peacekeeping operation in the former Yugoslavia, have almost identical positions on the subject, as became clear in talks in London on Tuesday between their two prime ministers, Mr John Major and Mr Edouard Balladur. Mr Alain Juppe, French foreign minister, said yesterday that, while military force might have to be used against the Bosnian Serbs if their parliament failed to give unequivocal approval to the peace plan, a decision to do so could only be taken by the UN Security Council after further consultations between the main powers concerned. Mr Juppe also told the weekly meeting of the French cabinet that US-French differences over the command of future peacekeeping forces and the possible lifting of the arms embargo on Bosnia had surfaced during talks in Paris on Tuesday with Mr Christopher. The US had 'clearly indicated' it would ask for the lifting of the arms embargo if the peace agreement was not ratified by the Bosnian Serb assembly, a government spokesman quoted Mr Juppe as telling the cabinet. 'As far as this solution goes, France has its reservations.' Mr Hurd strongly denied reports that international forces might be sent into Bosnia to impose the peace plan as long as the fighting continued and the plan had not been endorsed by the Bosnian Serbs. 'We certainly would not be putting in troops to push Serb troops out of areas which they have to vacate under the Vance-Owen plan,' Mr Hurd said. This categorically contradicted a statement in Brussels yesterday by Lord Owen, one of the international mediators, that a peacekeeping force must be prepared to fight, if necessary, to make the warring parties withdraw their troops. Mr Hurd, however, said the UN - including British - troops would do no more than monitor the withdrawal of the warring parties' forces to their designated areas, but would not be deployed until it was clear that the withdrawal was under way. He emphasised the government had not yet made a decision on Britain's contribution and reports that a 60,000-strong UN peacekeeping force would include 10,000 British troops were no more than 'speculative.'

Welcoming the IRA's three-day Easter ceasefire, he insisted  Sinn Fein had a right to be treated in the same way as Northern  Ireland's other political parties.    At a news conference in Belfast, Mr Adams sat alongside  leading Sinn Fein official Martin McGuinness and said the  ceasefire was a move along the road towards a lasting peace.    Mr Adams said he had faxed the Prime Minister at No. 10  asking him to ""authorise direct talks with Sinn Fein."" These  should be in the context of ""clarification -- not negotiation.""  But he said Mr. Major was under considerable political  pressure, adding: ""We know that he has problems within his own  party but he should take time to reflect on how the situation  can be moved forward.    ``The IRA's initiative creates an opportunity to break this  stalemate which has been created by London's refusal to provide  clarification for Sinn Fein in the same way as it has been  provided to all other parties. There was now an opportunity to  move on and enter into the next phase of the peace process.    ``Mr. Major should see this way to be flexible. To refuse to  talk, to be exclusive, to try to marginalise any section of our  people, may be safe but it will not bring lasting peace,'' Mr.  Adams declared.    He shrugged off criticism that the ceasefire was a cynical  public relations gesture, claiming that reaction was  ""predictable."" But he stressed the vast majority of people in  Ireland and Britain wanted peace and welcomed all advances in  the peace process.     "

Japan and Russia have been working out the schedule for the  trip after Japanese Deputy Foreign Minister Hiroshi Fukuda and  his Russian counterpart Aleksandr Panov earlier this week agreed  on Hata's visit in March. Fukuda and Panov agreed during two  days of meetings in Moscow to promote political dialogue between  the two nations and continue talks on a long-standing  territorial dispute involving four Russian-held islands off  Hokkaido.    Conditions for Hata's visit were set after Yeltsin vowed  Thursday in an address to Parliament to continue efforts to  settle the territorial row with Japan and conclude a peace  treaty, the officials said.    Japan claims sovereignty over Etorofu, Kunashiri and  Shikotan  islands and the Habomai group of islets, which the former Soviet  Union seized at the end of World War II. The dispute has  prevented the two sides from concluding a peace treaty.    But analysts say Tokyo and Moscow are unlikely to achieve  any  major breakthrough on the territorial row during Hata's visit  because ultrarightists and conservatives, opposed to returning  the islands to Japan, dominate the new Russian Parliament.    During his visit, Hata may also meet Russian Prime Minister  Viktor Chernomyrdin and other leaders of Parliament, the  officials said.    Hata is expected to voice Japan's support for Russia's  reform  efforts and shift toward a market-oriented economy in his talks  with Russian leaders, they said.    He is also likely to discuss promoting personnel exchanges  between the two nations, they said.     "

The gunmen opened fire with automatic weapons as customers at the crowded bar in the largely Catholic village of Loughinisland in Co Down watched the Republic of Ireland's opening World Cup soccer match on television. Five people were wounded. The Ulster Volunteer Force claimed responsibility for Saturday night's attack, saying it was in retaliation for last week's shooting of two Protestant men in Belfast. Police were last night braced for further sectarian violence. Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, condemned the killings as 'inhuman savagery' and said the gunmen would achieve 'no political purpose'. He pledged the RUC would never give up the hunt for the attackers. Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, said the incident had brought him close to despair. The attack prompted calls from Tory MPs for the introduction of internment as part of a security clampdown. Mr Andrew Hunter, chairman of the Conservative backbench Northern Ireland committee, urged the government to 'lift' 30-40 republican and loyalist terrorist ringleaders. He also called for the deployment of more troops on the province's streets. The attack came less than 48 hours after Mr Spring warned that a framework agreement on new constitutional arrangements for Northern Ireland was unlikely to be ready for next month's Anglo-Irish summit. However, Mr John Major, the prime minister, and Mr Albert Reynolds, his Irish counterpart, are expected to try to give new impetus to the peace effort when they meet at the European Union's summit in Corfu later this week. Mr Eddie McGrady, the Social Democratic and Labour party MP for South Down, said he hoped there would be no reprisal of any kind for the shootings. He said anyone attempting retaliation would be 'disowned by all our community and will not be acting on anybody's behalf'. Mr Kevin McNamara, shadow Northern Ireland secretary, cautioned against the reintroduction of internment, likening such a move to 'putting a lid on the cauldron' and saying it would end any prospect of constructive peace talks. The RUC Deputy Chief Constable Blair Wallace said: 'We are in the middle of a series of tit-for-tat killings. They started on Thursday and Friday and this was undoubtedly one of that series.' He said that but for the activities of the security forces there could have been more attacks 'because it is quite clear the terrorists are endeavouring to out-do the other in the enormity of their bloodlust'.

0,FT944-15807 ,"FT944-15807 _AN-EJQD5AB7FT 941017   FT  17 OCT 94 / Molyneaux backs further peace talks      By JAMES BLITZ and JOHN MURRAY BROWN      LONDON, BELFAST   Mr James Molyneaux, the leader of the Ulster Unionist party, has endorsed the prospect of negotiations between Sinn Fein and the British government. Amid clear indications that London will drop its insistence that an IRA ceasefire should be declared 'permanent', Mr Molyneaux said yesterday that negotiations between the British government and Irish nationalists would be a 'very, very important development'. The move came as the Irish government prepared in the light of the IRA and loyalist ceasefires to end a state of emergency that has existed in the republic since 1939. The UUP leader, speaking for the first time since the declaration last week of the loyalist ceasefire, said he did not see the word 'permanent' as an essential obstacle. Instead he told the BBC that the start of negotiations 'will mean that Her Majesty's government will be represented by intermediate-rank civil servants with a mix of intelligence officers to verify, to obtain from the IRA assurances . . . that their command structure has been disbanded'. His comments come amid strong expectations that Mr John Major will announce his government's readiness to initiate talks on the constitutional future of Northern Ireland in the next two weeks. A decision on such talks could be taken by the cabinet's Northern Ireland committee later this week. There is speculation that the government will make its intentions clear before a Commons debate on Ulster expected on October 26. Mr Molyneaux made clear yesterday that he did not expect the UUP to hold talks with Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein leader. Asked whether he would shake Mr Adams' hand, he replied: 'I don't quite see that happening for a long time because I don't see that we're going to be in the same company.' The remarks implied that Mr Molyneaux would like to see the peace process restricted to bilateral London-Sinn Fein talks. Speaking to the UUP conference at Carrickfergus on Saturday Mr Molyneaux also restated his party's misgivings about the peace process. He attacked as 'unworkable' the principle that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed. The republic's move to scrap the state of emergency, introduced in the second world war to deal with IRA activities, was described yesterday by Mr Dick Spring, the Irish deputy premier, as 'a powerful and symbolic way of saying that the national emergency is ended, and that a national nightmare is over'. Mr Spring told a meeting in Cork he would table proposals to revoke the 1976 Emergency Powers Act, introduced following the IRA murder in Dublin of British ambassador Christopher Ewart-Biggs and reinforcing earlier emergency powers, which allows the detention of terrorist suspects for a week without being charged. In the wake of the loyalist ceasefire Mr Martin MacGuinness of Sinn Fein raised the prospect of an early meeting with Mr David Ervine, representative of the loyalist paramilitaries.

0,FT944-9396 ,"FT944-9396 _AN-EKPEKABHFT 941116   FT  16 NOV 94 / Africa leaders bid to salvage Angola peace      By Our Foreign Staff   African leaders met in Zambia yesterday in an urgent attempt to keep Angola's faltering peace accord on track. The meeting of southern African states followed a last-minute postponement from yesterday to Sunday of the signing of the accord, painstakingly negotiated by United Nations mediators over 11 months. The leaders, who earlier this year used both carrot and stick to reverse a coup ousting one of their members in Lesotho, were drafting a tough statement telling Angola's warring sides to stop the bloodletting, officials said. Mr Thabo Mbeki, South Africa's deputy president, has already warned that the leaders will take action - widely seen as including military intervention - should the latest Angolan peace bid crumble as others before it. Although UN officials declined to give reasons for postponing the signing ceremony, officials said it was because Angola's Unita rebels had refused to sign while the government intensified the war. In the past two weeks, after the government and Unita had initialled the pact, Angolan army troops overran Unita's stronghold of Huambo in central Angola, throwing the peace process into doubt. The Lusaka talks are testing the capacity of the southern African states, which originally came together to help in the overthow of white minority governments in Rhodesia and South Africa, to act as guarantors of a regional security pact based on democratic governments. If such a grouping can succeed in southern Africa, it could set an example of conflict resolution from which the rest of the continent can learn. Whether manoeuvres in the field are designed to win advantages at the negotiating table, or the last resort of parties or individuals who fear the outcome of the ballot box, Angola is no different from other African states where an upsurge of violence has frequently preceded peace agreements. This time, however, the MPLA government may have turned the tables on Mr Jonas Savimbi, leader of the Unita movement. Since he rejected his 1992 election defeat, he has tried to win an ascendancy on the battlefield that would be reflected in the composition of the government that would emerge from the Lusaka peace talks. The MPLA, however, seems to have made two critical calculations. The first is that it could take Huambo. The second was based on an assessment of international opinion, in particular Washington and Moscow, the two key outside powers. When Mr Savimbi resorted to war after his election defeat he lost most of his friends in western capitals. Whether the MPLA has broken the spirit of the Lusaka talks or not, Unita's cries of foul play will have little impact. No one underestimates the capacity of Mr Savimbi further to disrupt the peace process. Even if the signing goes ahead on Sunday formidable obstacles remain - not the least of which is the integration of two rival forces into a national army. But regional and international developments are putting him under intense pressure. The prize is bringing peace to a region where the wars for independence began in the early 1960s: even the unpredictable Mr Savimbi, argue frontline officials in Lusaka, knows that sooner or later he has to settle his differences at the conference table and abide by the result.

""I believe what (Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin) said  is positive...it is the first time he makes such a statement and  it (means) an acceptance of the truth that peace cannot be  achieved as long as the settlements exist in their current  shape,"" Prime Minister 'Abd al-Salam al-Majali told reporters.    Restating Jordan's position that settlements are an obstacle  to peace, Dr. al-Majali said the Hebron massacre was a major  factor in ""shaking the idea of building and keeping settlements.""    Dr. al-Majali said Jordan was ready to hold the meetings of  the Jordanian-Palestinian coordination committees, blaming the  failure of these committees to meet on the Palestinian  engagement with the autonomy talks in Egypt.    He said this engagement partly justifies the Palestine  Liberation Organisation's (PLO) failure to hold the meetings of  these committees but ""does not justify it fully because a long  time has passed (since the formation of committees)."" He said,  ""our fear for the absence of coordination is that our brothers  in the organisation do not have enough experience in certain  issues and we are more experienced than them and could help them  and avoid harm.""    But coordination with Syria ""is at its best,"" said Dr.  al-Majali adding that Syria supports Jordan's demand for an end  to the siege on al-'Aqabah and the two countries along with  other Arab partners will meet to coordinate before the  resumption of the bilateral peace talks.    He said the Hebron massacre and the siege on al-'Aqabah  contributed to the halting of the peace talks until the  emergence of positive signs about these issues.    Dr. al-Majali rejected accusations that his government  lacked  a strategy on the process or its media policy, saying Jordan was  among the first countries to seek peace in the region.    Reiterating Jordan's commitment to a comprehensive peace in  the Middle East, the prime minister said Jordan will be ready  for discussing all issues related to the peace process when it  resumes.    He said Jordan will take into consideration developments on  other tracks of the negotiations which will lead to peace  treaties in accordance with the Madrid formula.    Dr. al-Majali repeated Jordan's rejection of Israel's  ""illogical"" demands to sign a peace treaty before resolving the  issues on the agenda for the talks signed by the two countries  in September last year.    He said the objective of the negotiations is to reach a  peace  treaty but only after all issues in the agenda have been  resolved.    In reply to a question on the status of the Islamic  Resistance Movement, Hamas, in Jordan, Dr. al-Majali reiterated  that Jordan does not accept ""any illegal grouping"" and will only  deal with the PLO as the representative of the Palestinian  people.    Dr. al-Majali said Jordanian relations with some Gulf Arab  countries have improved but said ""some issues"" remain unresolved  between the Kingdom and Saudi Arabia.    ""Time will reveal it all and the day will come when the  brothers will realise that we did not do them any wrong at all,""  the prime minister told foreign correspondents at the Prime  Ministry.    Dr. al-Majali held the Jordanian media responsible for the  failure of the reconciliation efforts among Arab states, adding  that Jordan received some complaints from some Arab Gulf  countries about reports carried by the country's unofficial  media.    ""The role of the press was not positive in improving  relations,"" Dr. al-Majali said, expressing an opinion he has  projected earlier.    Dr. al-Majali, who said the media ""shoulders 95 per cent of  the responsibility"" for the tension in relations with the Gulf,  said Jordan had told countries which complained that the media  in Jordan are free and ""we have never guided (them),"" adding  that the Press and Publication Law bans the publishing of news  that harm friendly countries and legal cases have been launched  against those who violated the law.    Pointing out that the government cannot control the  unofficial press, Dr. al-Majali said, ""the role played by the  official media towards Arab relations is positive and there was  nothing in them that could be interpreted as offensive to our  brothers in the Arab countries.""    Responding to a question on whether Egypt was trying to  undermine Jordan's role in the region, Dr. al-Majali said that  Egypt and Jordan had strong relations and the two countries look  into means of strengthening them.    The prime minister said Jordan played a mediation role in  the  Yemeni conflict upon the request of its leaders who trust the  wisdom of His Majesty King Husayn. But he said there are  differences in Yemen that might have become personal which makes  the implementation of the reconciliation agreement signed in  Amman difficult.    The prime minister said: ""We believe in the Iraqi people,  their freedom and (the need) to lift the injustice inflicted  upon them.""    The Iraqi people, he said, ""are free in their choice of its  leadership and we do not impose our opinion on them because we  do not allow ourselves to interfere in the affairs of others.""    Asked about the reported involvement of an Arab country in  the assassination of Jordanian diplomat Na'ib al-Ma'ayitah in  Beirut in January, Dr. al-Majali said the results of the  investigation conducted by the Lebanese authorities did not name  any country behind the assassination.    The prime minister said the two suspects arrested in the  case  admitted that their organisation, Abu-Nidal Group, assassinated  Mr. Ma'ayitah because it ""was not happy with Jordan's policy.""    It was ""a big plot; too many people were involved,"" said Dr.  al-Majali, adding that the assassins had planned to kill the  Jordanian ambassador in Beirut.     "
0,FT942-1360 ,"FT942-1360 _AN-EFXC1AEAFT 940624   FT  24 JUN 94 / London and Dublin close to framework Ulster deal      By PHILIP STEPHENS and TIM COONE      CORFU, DUBLIN   Mr John Major and Mr Albert Reynolds were on course last night to agree the framework for a comprehensive political settlement in Northern Ireland by mid-July . As the British and Irish prime ministers prepared for bilateral talks at the European Union summit in Corfu, senior Whitehall officials voiced confidence that they could clear the remaining roadblocks to the agreement before next month's Anglo-Irish summit. There are continuing differences over repeal of Dublin's constitutional claim to Ulster and over the shape and authority of proposed joint boards to enhance cross-border co-operation. However the officials said Mr Major was determined to find a formula to bridge the remaining differences over the 'constitutional balance' of the accord. The escalation of sectarian violence in the province - underlined by last week's murder of six Catholic men in their local bar  - has added further impetus to the search for an accord. Once agreed, the framework document - covering relations between London and Dublin, cross-border co-operation and outline plans for a new assembly in Northern Ireland - will be presented as the basis for renewed talks between the constitutional parties. It is understood that Britain has rejected any suggestion that new north-south institutions could imply 'joint authority' over the province. The Ulster Unionists, whose co-operation is a prerequisite to an eventual settlement, are determined that the Dublin government is not given constitutional authority in the administration of Ulster. But Mr Major is prepared to see cross-border executive boards to oversee a common approach in areas such as transport, energy, agriculture and tourism. The creation of such boards - whose powers would be decided in consultation with the constitutional parties - would acknowledge the two governments had a 'shared interest' in the economic development of the province. The Irish foreign ministry wishes the boards to have 'executive powers', embracing the main areas of mutual economic concern to the two parts of the island. For his part, Mr Reynolds is arguing that a commitment by the Dublin government to amend or repeal articles two and three of the Irish constitution - which encapsulate the republic's territorial claim to Northern Ireland - must be contingent on an overall political settlement acceptable to nationalists as well as unionists in Ulster.

0,FT941-14794 ,"FT941-14794 _AN-EASC7AAVFT 940119   FT  19 JAN 94 / Syria throws doubt on Israeli readiness to reach peace deal      By JULIAN OZANNE and ROGER MATTHEWS      JERUSALEM, LONDON   Syria expressed its disappointment yesterday at Israel's reaction to the summit meeting on Sunday between President Hafez al-Assad and US President Bill Clinton, and said it cast doubt on the Jewish state's willingness to make peace. After the meeting in Geneva, Mr Assad said Syria had made a strategic choice to seek peace with Israel and was ready for a full normalisation of relations with all its neighbours. 'We are surprised by the contradictory reactions in Israel,' Mr Farouq al-Shara'a, Syria's foreign minister, said on arriving in Amman to brief Crown Prince Hassan of Jordan on the outcome of the summit. 'We were expecting a big welcome to what was announced in the wake of the summit between the two presidents,' he said. 'Instead of that we are hearing statements on a referendum and demands for more. All of this makes us doubt the real intentions of the Israelis in achieving a just peace.' Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, yesterday confirmed his support for an eventual referendum on peace with Syria in what was seen as an attempt to put pressure on Damascus and win over domestic opposition ahead of peace talks which are due to resume next week. Israeli ministers, who are deeply divided on the issue, emphasised that a choice on whether to call a referendum or hold national elections on territorial concessions to Syria would only be considered once a peace agreement had been finalised and initialled. Political analysts said Mr Rabin, in raising the referendum possibility, was more concerned with sending a message to Syria that Damascus would have to be more flexible and conciliatory to win over a sceptical Israeli public. Mr Rabin, they said, was also playing a domestic political gambit to marginalise the opposition both inside and outside his Labour party, encourage the Shas party to rejoin the weak coalition and calm the 13,000 Golan settlers to enable the government to negotiate without facing a nationwide campaign against the peace talks. Mr Rabin said: 'If and when we come to a draft of a peace treaty between Syria - and it demands a painful price, perhaps beyond what the residents of Israel expect - if, I emphasise if and when, in my opinion it will have to be brought to a referendum.' President Assad has consistently demanded an Israeli commitment to a full withdrawal from the occupied Golan Heights, and he repeated this basic objective during more than five hours of talks with Mr Clinton. The Israeli proposal for a referendum was certain to be viewed with the deepest suspicion in Damascus because it would mean that whatever deal was ultimately negotiated could be subsequently overturned. Under such a scheme, Mr Assad would be obliged to commit himself, without a parallel guarantee from Israel. Syrian officials have stressed that future negotiations with Israel, due to resume next week in Washington, would be meaningless without an understanding that Israel would acknowledge ultimate Syrian sovereignty over the Golan.

Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, said the only positive aspect about an attempt by Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, to reassure nationalists about last month's Downing Street declaration was the recognition that clarification could be appropriate in future. Mr Adams described the declaration as 'a masterpiece of ambiguity'. He said it was absurd that the UK government would not 'supply the request for clarification that has been put to them in quite reasonable terms by me'. His remarks reawakened fears that a prolonged stand-off between the two camps was in prospect. Mr Adams insisted, however, that the political wing of the IRA was not 'searching for a 'no''. Sinn Fein was 'not going to allow the British government to squander this opportunity for peace'. He told Channel 4 News: 'It's not exactly the best government the British people have had to rule them. It's a very dismal government on many domestic counts and no different in terms of its dealing with the question of Ireland.' His remarks followed the delivery of a firm rebuff from Downing Street to Sinn Fein's demand for direct dialogue on the declaration. Downing Street accused Mr Adams of seeking to 'reopen issues for renegotiation' in a letter sent to the prime minister earlier this month. Publishing both this original letter and a terse response signed by a senior government official, Downing Street told Mr Adams that there was 'no question' of the joint declaration being renegotiated. 'That text, and only that text, is what is at issue,' it said. Mr Adams reacted angrily, accusing Mr John Major of 'a patently obvious attempt to frustrate a genuine effort to end the stand-off'. The release of the letters coincided with a Commons debate in which Sir Patrick said Sinn Fein had given no 'particulars' of what it wanted clarified. Talk of clarification was 'but a smokescreen to distract attention' from whether 'all those now engaged in violence' would renounce it. Drawing on an earlier speech seeking to reassure nationalists and unionists, Sir Patrick said the aspiration of a united Ireland by peaceful means was 'fully legitimate'. He hinted that Britain's broadcasting ban on Sinn Fein would be lifted only if republican leaders renounced terrorism. Sinn Fein has said it will make no formal response to the Downing Street declaration until at least the end of next month.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.     IEZ  Ireland, EC.

0,FT931-3958 ,"FT931-3958 _AN-DCLBZAHIFT 930312   FT  12 MAR 93 / Peace mediators seek help from Milosevic      By ROBERT MAUTHNER      PARIS   THE international mediators seeking a peace settlement in Bosnia-Hercegovina yesterday tried to enlist the help of Serbia's President Slobodan Milosevic in persuading the Bosnian Serbs to accept their plan for a Bosnian state divided into 10 semi-autonomous provinces. But the meeting between Mr Cyrus Vance, Lord Owen and Mr Milosevic, hosted at the Elysee Palace by President Francois Mitterrand of France, was undermined even before it started by statements by both the Bosnian Moslems and Serbs that they were not prepared to endorse the peace plan in its present form. Mr Vance and Lord Owen had hoped to isolate Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader. But they were thwarted when President Alija Izetbegovic, the Moslem Bosnian president, said on Wednesday he would not return to the peace talks in New York at the end of this week to sign the mediators' map, as he had previously intimated. Mr Izetbegovic has delayed his return to New York until the middle of next week at the earliest, pending further consultations with other members of the joint Bosnian presidency, several of whom, including Mr Ejup Ganic, the vice-president, are reported to be strongly opposed to the Vance-Owen plan. When Mr Izetbegovic finally returns to New York, he is expected to take with him demands for changes to the map which will almost certainly prove unacceptable to Mr Karadzic. In a letter to the British newspaper, the Daily Telegraph, published yesterday, Mr Karadzic warned the mediators and the international community against any attempt to isolate or oust him. Stressing that the Vance-Owen map was acceptable neither to the Serbs nor the Moslems, the Bosnian Serb leader said: 'We should recognise that fact and not believe that assent can be imposed.' Before meeting Mr Milosevic, Mr Vance emphasised that the mediators would talk 'totally frankly' about the problems facing them. They were expected to tell him that, if the Bosnian Serbs refused to subscribe to the peace plan, Serbia would face tougher United Nations sanctions. These would include total diplomatic isolation and draconian new measures to stop supplies reaching the country along the Danube. Lord Owen said the Paris talks offered the Bosnian Serbs an opportunity 'to move ahead of the game', by which he is understood to mean that, by accepting the peace plan now, they could isolate the Moslems, instead of the other way round. It remains questionable, however, whether President Milosevic would be prepared to exert great pressure on his close ally Mr Karadzic to accept the peace plan as long as the Bosnian Moslems remained uncommitted to it. President Mitterrand, who has always believed the EC should take a leading role in solving the crisis of the former Yugoslavia, had a long telephone conversation on Wednesday evening with Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany to discuss the Bosnian situation.

They warned that Saudi Arabia's cold reception could push  Jordan further towards Syria -- Israel's arch Arab foe.    King Fahd cold-shouldered the Jordanian monarch during his  visit, ignoring the opportunity for a reconciliation meeting.    It was King Husayn's first trip to Saudi since July 1990,  just before the Gulf crisis erupted. But he cut short his visit  Wednesday when he was ignored by Saudi authorities.    Relations between the two countries soured during the Gulf  crisis when Riyadh accused Amman of backing Iraqi President  Saddam Husayn, whose forces had invaded and occupied Kuwait.    Although ties with Saudi Arabia have traditionally been  complicated because of old rivalries between the two ruling  families, Jordan has found itself increasingly isolated in the  rest of Arab world since the end of the war.    Officially, Jordanian authorities played down the Saudi  trip,  saying the only purpose had been the king's pilgrimage.    But privately a senior Jordanian official commented: ""There  was a clear desire by the Saudis to humiliate not only the  Hashemite family...but also the Jordanian Government.""    And although the snub clearly came from Riyadh, Jordanian  leaders say it was prompted by the United States, keen to step  up pressure on Amman to sign a peace accord with Israel.    Israel and Jordan signed a common peace agenda in Washington  on September 14 -- a day after the historic Israeli-PLO autonomy  accord was agreed -- to serve as a framework for future talks  between the two countries.    But several sticking points remain, notably border  demarcations, water sharing rights and the issue of the  Palestinian refugees who fled to Jordan in the 1967 Middle East  war.    In January King Husayn held talks with U.S. President Bill  Clinton during a visit to Washington discussing Jordan's debt to  the United States, the side-effects of the UN-imposed embargo on  Iraq for Jordan and prospects for restoring links with Saudi  Arabia.    ""Sign a peace treaty with Israel and all these issues will  be  sorted out,"" a senior Jordanian official, who asked to remain  anonymous, quoted the U.S. President as saying.    But King Husayn has said he is anxious to avoid protracted  negotiations, which have marked the Israeli-PLO relationship.  The dialogue has been suspended since the February 25 Hebron  mosque massacre.    Jordan remains unwelcome in other Gulf states apart from  Oman  and Qatar. Jordanian officials announced Thursday that King  Husayn is to visit Qatar for the first time since February 20.  An unconfirmed report said the visit would take place on March  20.    Relations with Egypt are also cool and Amman's estrangement  from the Palestine Liberation Organisation was revealed when PLO  Chairman Yasir 'Arafat chose not to tell Amman of the secret  talks with Israel which led to September's accord.    Officials say that as a result of Jordan's isolation it is  being pushed closer towards Syria, in a move bound to worry U.S.  leaders.    But in Jordanian political circles the message Thursday was  that following the Saudi snub, King Husayn has even less reason  to make conciliatory moves towards Israel.     "

Under the accord, a UN human rights mission will be set up inside Guatemala as soon as possible and will visit any part of the country and demand information at any time from the army and the government. The agreement, reached in Mexico City on Tuesday after five days of talks, ends almost three years of talks aimed at improving Guatemala's human rights record, one of the worst in Latin America. More than 100,000 people have been killed and another 40,000 'disappeared' since the war began in the early 1960s. 'This is a huge advance. It is the first major agreement signed in the peace process,' said Mr Marrack Goulding, the UN under-secretary-general for political affairs. He said the United Nations would send down a preliminary team to prepare the ground for the mission. Guatemala's warring sides also agreed on a broad agenda for talks aiming at definitive peace accords by December.   Countries:-  GTZ  Guatemala, Central America.     MXZ  Mexico.

Your Excellency, madame deputy speaker of the National  Council of Development; Your Excellency, the minister [as  heard]. Rwandans, our country is currently going through  difficult times. We are going to set up a government which will  deal with the very difficult question of war and also the  question of insecurity in the country and famine, especially  among those displaced by the war. The three points make up the  program of the present government. The present government will  therefore carry out its duties especially by providing security  for people and property and by restoring understanding among the  people. That is why the ministers in charge of security, that  is, the ministers of defense, communal development, and justice  will do everything possible to restore peace as soon as  possible. Let us say within about two weeks.    The minister of justice should do his utmost to convene a  meeting of all heads of tribunals so that they can start  investigations to identify all wrongdoers, such as those who  killed and looted in many areas of the country, especially in  Kigali town. The minister of defense must do everything  possible to restore peace and tranquillity in the entire  country, especially in Kigali town. The minister of interior  and communal development is asked to convene a meeting of all  prefects as soon as possible so that they may look for ways of  restoring peace and pacifying the Rwandans.    Second, the current government will continue talks with the  Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] so that transitional institutions  based on the Arusha agreement may be set up in six weeks' time.  The Rwandan Government believes that there is no other way of  restoring peace to the country apart from continuing talks with  the RPF.    That is why it stresses the fact that the RPF should know  that the problems with which our country finds itself following  the death of the president of the republic, His Excellency Major  General Juvenal Habyarimana, followed by that of the prime  minister and some government members and innocent people, should  not be a pretext for renewing the fighting since, as we said  earlier, the government is going to do its utmost to restore  peace in the country.    I thank the outgoing government for everything it did  towards  setting up transitional government institutions despite the many  hindrances to the implementation of the planned program. The  Rwandan Government will do its utmost to ensure that all the  hindrances to setting up the transitional government are removed  so that the Arusha agreement may be implemented as agreed. This  will be done with only the welfare of the people at heart and  not personal or group interests.    Concerning famine, which is the third objective of this  government, the Ministry of Planning and Communal Government is  called upon to start talks with the nongovernmental  organizations which have always assisted us in our problems so  that we may get enough assistance to go to the rescue of the  people affected by famine almost everywhere in the country,  especially those displaced by the current war which we have  known for almost four years.    Rwandans and friends of Rwanda, this country is in a very  critical situation. The contribution of everyone is necessary  so that we can solve the difficult problems. That is why we  call upon international organizations and traditional friendly  countries to support this government so that it can carry out  its three-point program. [passage omitted]     "
0,FT942-9492 ,"FT942-9492 _AN-EEPCBAA3FT 940516   FT  16 MAY 94 / Hint of flexibility in Syria peace talks: Christopher starts shuttle in Damascus      By MARK NICHOLSON      DAMASCUS   Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, arrived last night in Damascus on a mini-shuttle that US officials hope can produce discernible progress in talks between Israel and Syria, amid a rare official hint of possible flexibility from Syria. Mr Christopher went straight into talks with Mr Hafez al-Assad, the Syrian president, and Mr Farouk al-Sharaa, his foreign minister, and is expected to travel on within the next 24 hours to Jerusalem. US officials said they then expect Mr Christopher to return for further talks in Damascus. The intensity of the shuttle, coming just two weeks after Mr Christopher's last visit to Damascus, indicates US determination to achieve progress on the Israeli-Syrian front following the Israeli-Palestine Liberation Organisation agreement earlier this month to implement the first stages of limited Palestinian self-rule. Mr Christopher's prompt return also suggests Syria believes there is something to be discussed, despite the fact that Israeli and Syrian negotiators have not met face-to-face since the last round of Washington-hosted peace talks in September last year. Negotiations have since proceeded primarily through US mediation, both in Mr Christopher's two previous shuttles and in the Geneva summit earlier this year between President Bill Clinton and Mr Assad. Mr Christopher will certainly seek Syrian commitment to accept the longstanding US invitation to resume bilateral talks with Israel in Washington. But there are signs his mediation is itself making progress. After his last trip on the eve of the May 4 US-PLO deal, Mr Christopher spoke of the Israeli-Syrian track having entered a new 'substantive' phase. Mr Christopher will also visit Jericho, the West Bank town newly handed over by Israel to limited Palestinian authority, during the shuttle, US officials said yesterday. The visit will be the first by any international statesman to the new areas of limited Palestinian self-rule. After his last shuttle, Syria rejected an Israeli proposal for an Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights staged over a number of years. Syrian officials instead repeated Mr Assad's firm demand that a peace deal could come only after an Israeli commitment to full and immediate withdrawal from the heights, which it has occupied since the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. However, Tishreen, the state newspaper, yesterday signalled a possible softening on the question, saying that Syria was ready to reach a deal with Israel if it concluded 'a clear commitment for withdrawal from the whole of the Golan within a reasonable and acceptable period of time'. Diplomats in Damascus said that while the question of a phased Israeli withdrawal has long been privately aired, it has seldom been officially referred to so directly or positively. 'It is certainly a sign of more flexibility,' said one. Most observers believe Syria would insist on a phased withdrawal over months, rather than the several years suggested by Israel. However, few observers in Damascus expect Mr Christopher's visit to achieve a public breakthrough. For this, Israel is still requiring Mr Assad to spell out in detail what he means by a 'full peace' with Syria, while Mr Assad in turn wants Israel to make an unequivocal statement of willingness to return the Golan to Syrian sovereignty and withdraw from it entirely. Moreover, Syria is also determined to wrest bilateral concessions from the US in return for delivering a deal with Israel - a matter which will certainly feature in Mr Christopher's talks.

SOME JEWISH LEADERS  SAY A DIALOGUE IS EVEN MORE TIMELY. OTHERS WANT TO AVOID CONTACT.      By WILLIAM TUOHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER      JERUSALEM      Because of the crisis over Kuwait, Israeli moderates appear to be sharply  divided over renewing talks with Palestinian leaders aimed at reviving the  Middle East peace process.    Widespread Palestinian support for Iraq's President Saddam Hussein has  depressed and angered generally left-wing Israelis who argue that establishing  a dialogue with the Palestinians is more important than ever.    ""I think it is most important for the government of Israel to talk with  Palestinians and the PLO (the Palestine Liberation Organization),"" said Amnon  Goldblum, a spokesman for the Peace Now organization.    ""South Africa should be an example to us. President (Frederik W.) de Klerk  talked to (nationalist leader) Nelson Mandela even though he was the  representative of a terrorist organization.""    Unless the Israelis make a similar move and talk with the Palestinians,  Goldblum said, there will probably be more Palestinian violence and more  Israeli violence in response.    ""This attitude of the government -- not talking to Palestinians -- encourages  extremism,"" he said, ""and I worry about the character of Israel and our  democracy.""    Yael Dayan, a dovish Labor Party member of the Knesset and daughter of the late  Gen. Moshe Dayan, says it is necessary to maintain contacts with the  Palestinian leadership, despite the anger at the Palestinian support for  Hussein's invasion of Kuwait.    ""We have to be thinking about the morning after this crisis,"" she said in Tel  Aviv. ""The Palestinians will still be here, and we will have to have a  dialogue. I think it is a tremendous mistake to stop talking to them. Sure, we  disagree with them on more things than we agree on, but disagreement is a form  of dialogue. We have eventually to cooperate with Palestinians. We have no  other choice.""    But others involved in the peace process have changed their emphasis in the  face of the Palestinians' support for President Hussein. Yossi Sarid of the  Citizens Rights Movement declared:    ""I personally do not feel the need for meetings with Palestinians now. I feel  as if a lot of wires have been cut, and it will take time until I feel a need  for meetings of this type. I think we are talking about such a deep  misunderstanding that I do not see us on the same platform in the near future.  This is a wound that will take a long time to heal.""    Eleazar Granot, chairman of Mapam, the United Workers Party, said the PLO, by  supporting Iraq, ""has placed a serious question mark over whether it will  represent the Palestinian nation in future negotiations.""    ""The Palestinian response is unfortunate,"" he went on. ""They are pinning the  fate of the Palestinian nation on the success or failure of this man.""    Prof. Amnon Rubinstein, a Knesset member for the Shinui Party, said the  Palestinians' action was ""political stupidity, since their stand ensures that  the start of talks about peace is further off.""    Rubinstein argued that the PLO's position on Iraq does not alter the need ""to  find a settlement with the Palestinians.""    ""We cannot swallow them up, we cannot digest them, and we cannot expel them,""  he said. ""Within a short time, the Palestinians will discover that all their  dreams and all Saddam Hussein's rantings are worth nothing.""    A leader of the Citizens Rights Movement, Knesset member Dedi Zucker, said:  ""Even the grave mistake made by the Palestinians now is not enough to move me  from my basic position, that our basic interest demands the separate  development of two nations, separation and the erection of a demilitarized  Palestinian state next to Israel. But you have to be an idiot not to understand  that the Israeli public will be less sensitive to this issue in the near  future.""    The Israeli press has given prominent play to statements by liberal Jewish  Americans such as Prof. Alan M. Dershowitz of Harvard Law School and Menachem  Rosensaft, who met with PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat, saying they were  re-examining their pro-Palestinian positions because of the PLO stand on the  Iraqi invasion.    Still, peace supporters such as Dayan and Goldblum insist that the very  pro-Iraqi stance of the Palestinians is evidence that the peace process is  necessary.    ""Had there been peace talks under way in Cairo,"" Goldblum said, ""Israel  couldn't have been cast as a villain by Saddam Hussein.""

Final consummation of the relationship, long sought by Israel, would complete the Jewish state's formal ties to all five members of the United Nations Security Council following the re-establishment of full relations with the then Soviet Union last year. It would clear away any Israeli objections to Chinese participation in the multilateral phase of the Middle East peace talks due to open in Moscow on January 28, just as the resumption of ties with the Kremlin opened the way for the Soviet Union - its place now assumed by Russia - to co-sponsor the peace negotiations with the US. The third round of so-far fruitless bilateral talks between Israel and the Syrians, Lebanese, Jordanians and Palestinians are set to get under way in Washington today. There are hopes that a proceand the joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegation will be overcome, but Israel says its negotiators will not stay in the US beyond Thursday, narrowing the room for substantive progress until a fourth round at a location yet to be determined. Israel has been pressing China to make the move to a formal diplomatic relationship for years, to draw Beijing away from its close public support for Arab nations. Ironically, however, the two sides have well-established informal trading links with an emphasis on military products, which has upset Washington since US military sales to China were banned after the violent suppression of the pro-democracy movement in 1989. Israel opened a scientific liaison office in Beijing in 1990, but had become an important source of technological support in areas from arms to agriculture well before then. Reports have emerged of extensive defence industry co-operation, including Israeli contracts for equipping Chinese tanks, jet fighters and possibly advanced missiles.

In the first of three incidents, Palestinian gunmen killed a Jewish settler and his son and wounded three children in an ambush in Hebron, flashpoint of recent Arab-Jewish tension, where Jewish settlers toting guns attacked Arab vehicles. Two other settlers were wounded in a firebomb attack on a bus near the occupied West Bank village of al-Jib. Israeli undercover troops shot dead a Palestinian outside his house near Rammalah in the West Bank. The latest killings are bound to inflame the tit-for-tat violence which has left at least 18 Israelis and 34 Palestinians dead since the peace agreement was signed in September, and raised to five the number of Israelis killed by Palestinians in the past five days. Israel's premier Yitzhak Rabin yesterday condemned the Palestinian killings of Jewish settlers. 'I have no doubt the goal of the Palestinians who did this terrible murder (they have just one goal) is to create a chain of events that will bring the negotiations to an end.' Mr Rabin rejected Mr Arafat's demand that Israel keep its promise and start withdrawing troops from the occupied Gaza Strip and West Bank area of Jericho next Monday. A two-to-three-week delay was inevitable because both sides had yet to reach agreement on security, military and economic issues, he said. Israel welcomed two humanitarian gestures by Syria to grant exit permits to Syrian Jews and co-operate in searching for seven missing Israeli soldiers. The moves were seen in Jerusalem as confidence-building signs of progress in the stalled Israeli-Syrian peace talks, the focus of current Middle East shuttle diplomacy by Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state. Mr Arafat, who met Mr Christopher in Amman yesterday, said he had asked the US to press Israel to meet its obligations under the Israeli-Palestinian peace accord and start the phased troop withdrawal next Monday. Mr Christopher has refused to intervene, but has urged 'timely implementation' of the agreement. He is due to return to Damascus on Thursday after another round of talks with Israeli leaders. In Cairo, where the two sides are seeking agreement on military and security issues, Mr Nabil Shaath, chief PLO negotiator, said the talks were at a standstill. The two sides have yet to agree the size of the Jericho area and the control of border crossings. Israeli foreign minister Shimon Peres said they were near agreement providing for Israeli control of the crossings but with a Palestinian presence. In Paris, Israeli finance minister Avraham Shochat met Mr Ahmed Qurie to try to advance talks on future economic relations between Israel and the Palestinian economy. Disagreements focus on an Israeli proposal for a customs union with harmonisation of taxes and duties. Editorial comment, Page 16   Countries:-  ILZ  Israel, Middle East.

All it means is that  the IRA wolf feels the need, right now, to adjust its sheep's  clothing. Its bloodstained snout was showing, and even the most  gullible were beginning to notice.    The sheep's clothing is, of course, Sinn Fein, the political  and propaganda front of the IRA. The adjuster is the president  of Sinn Fein, Gerry Adams. Mr Adams is, to our misfortune, an  extremely skilled operator. Over the Downing Street  Declaration, both on the run-up to it and in its aftermath, Mr  Adams played a blinder. He succeeded in becoming widely  accepted as essentially a man of peace, while remaining the  known head of the political arm of a terrorist organisation. It  would be hard to parallel that achievement, just as it would be  hard to parallel the complacent fatuity of the two governments  whose craven compliance made it possible.    All the same, even for such a virtuoso as Mr Adams, the  conduct of a peace process in harness with a continuing campaign  of terror is a demanding business. The peace fans were  beginning to be a bit restive by the time five months of  continuing IRA terror had followed a Downing Street Declaration  which the poor suckers had been led to believe would result in a  permanent cessation of violence. To keep his Orwellian peace  process in being, for the benefit of the killers whom he serves,  Gerry Adams needed some new tricks, and he has now come up with  some plausible ones. These are contained in the present comedy  of clarification/elucidation into which the British Government  allowed itself to be drawn by Mr Adams, through his  indefatigable intermediaries, John Hume and Albert Reynolds.    It worked this way: Mr Adams allowed it to be known, through  that ever-dependable grapevine, that if he got positive answers  to some of the questions which he would put to the British  Government, he would make a conciliatory response to the British  answers as a whole. From previous experience, he knew that both  the Irish and British Governments would fall for that one, since  it would enable them to claim that the Downing Street peace  process, for which they had made such extravagant claims, was  beginning to show results.    Mr Adams was not disappointed. Sinn Fein's 20 questions were  worked over by Irish and British officials, supplied with  specifications by Mr Hume, briefed by Mr Adams, as to the  minimum required to elicit a conciliatory response from Sinn  Fein. Mr Adams did not ask for too much. He knows the British  are not yet ready to abandon the guarantee to the majority in  Northern Ireland that there shall be no constitutional change in  the status of their province without their consent. For the  moment, Mr Adams just wanted small things, which would give him  an opportunity to sound conciliatory in reply, thus remaining  central to the peace process and supplying decent cover for that  unsightly snout.    The most welcome aspect of the replies, for Sinn Fein, is  that London replied at all. Earlier, John Major had haughtily  refused Sinn Fein's request for clarifications, saying ""take it  or leave it"". Now he has meekly filled in the Sinn Fein  questionnaire. To Sinn Fein-IRA, this change demonstrates a  promising flexibility under the pressure of its own continuing  armed struggle -- the reality behind the peace process. Further  demonstrations of flexibility will be sought, by the same  well-tried methods.    A whiff of Sinn Fein-IRA's real thinking can be picked up  from a report in yesterday's IRISH TIMES of an interview with ""a  senior republican source in West Belfast."" The source said --  ""The British answers to our questions showed that at present  they are not prepared to move on the key issues, which are the  Unionist veto and their (British Government's) becoming  persuaders (of the Unionists) for Irish unity.... We are nowhere  near the conditions that would merit a cease-fire. (But) we  don't want to be negative -- that's why statements went out  offering limited praise of the British response.... We have to  keep the peace process alive, yet stress that the British  haven't offered enough.""    In Northern Ireland, the Unionist community feels the screws  tightening on it, through the continuation of the IRA's armed  struggle and a peace process centring on Sinn Fein.  Predictably, the loyalist paramilitaries are increasingly  active. Overall, violent incidents, by both sets of  paramilitaries, increased in the four months following the  Downing Street Declaration, compared with the equivalent months  of the previous year. Last weekend, some loyalists were sniping  at members of the RUC [Royal Ulster Constabulary], while others  were attempting a bombing operation against a Sinn Fein-IRA pub  in Dublin.    The attempt was unsuccessful, but a young doorman, Martin  Doherty, was shot in the course of it. His funeral rites  provided the occasion for the most open IRA demonstrations  Dublin has known for many years: probably since the foundation  of the state, 73 years ago. The IRISH TIMES ran a big  photograph of the paramilitary funeral on its front page. The  opposition denounced the Government and the gardai for failing  to respond to this open paramilitary challenge to the authority  of the state. In return, Martin McGuinness, at the interment of  Doherty's remains, denounced the opposition leaders as  ""quislings."" In that paramilitary context, that term has an  ominous ring.    Sinn Fein has gained enormously in perceived legitimacy in  the republic in the months since the Downing Street Declaration.  Now Sinn Fein's masters, the IRA itself, are seeking to emerge  openly as defenders of the people against the loyalist violence  that they themselves have provoked and continue to provoke.    There is some daft talk at present of including the loyalist  paramilitaries, as well as the IRA, in the peace process. What  is really needed is to shake off the delusive peace process and  deal with both sets of paramilitary godfathers, not as  politicians to be conciliated but as terrorists to be brought  under control. That may yet happen, but I fear that the growing  violence will be allowed to get worse before the governments see  through the peace process.     "

""Through the CSNPD's fault and because of its intransigence, we  were only able to examine a certain number of problems,"" the  minister, who led the government delegation to the Bangui talks  at the end of February, stated on national radio. The objective  of these talks, which were held under the auspices of the  Central African Republic [CAR] authorities, was to sign a peace  agreement between the government and the CNSPD. They only  resulted in the signing of a simple joint communique between the  two sides.    ""Right from the start, the CSNPD laid down conditions. When  one goes to a negotiation and starts with conditions, it often  does not bode well,"" Mr. Izzo added. Despite this, he added,  ""we examined these conditions, but the meeting was only able to  agree on matters of principle, particularly on the cease-fire,  the withdrawal of the republican guards from the south of the  country, and the free movement of goods and persons.""    According to reliable sources, Moise Kette had demanded at  the opening of the talks the withdrawal of the republican guards  -- an elite unit under the exclusive orders of President Idriss  Deby -- as well as the holding of a referendum within a short  time in order to institute federalism in Chad. The republican  guards have been accused of molesting civilians in the south of  the country, thus provoking a massive exodus towards the CAR.  In June 1993, a cease-fire agreement was signed between the  Chadian Government and the CSNPD.     "

The negotiations, due to be resumed in Geneva today, are about to deal with the most controversial element of the international mediators' peace plan - the detailed map of the ten provinces into which Bosnia will be divided. 'There are no illusions; the map discussions will be difficult,' Mr Fred Eckhard, the mediators' spokesman said yesterday. As with the negotiations last week on the constitutional principles, the talks will be attended by the top leaders of the rump Yugoslavia, federal President Dobrica Cosic, Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic and Montenegran President Momir Bulatovic. It was President Milosevic's intervention, in particular, which persuaded the Bosnian Serbs to accept the constitutional framework. Anxious not to lose the momentum of the negotiations, the Geneva conference's co-chairmen, Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, will urge an agreement on the map during the current session of the talks. They are prepared to draw out the talks as long as necessary. However, given the deep disagreements over territory which still divide the three ethnic groups, a more realistic prospect is that the negotiations will run into the sand by about Tuesday and will be adjourned for a few days to give an opportunity for further bilateral contacts. The mediators' plan provides for the creation of an independent, unified state of Bosnia, divided into 10 largely self-governing provinces. But though the Croats have already accepted the provincial map, both the Moslems and Serbs are deeply unhappy with some of the provincial borders. The Moslems, who accounted for more than 40 per cent of Bosnia's population before the conflict began last April, are demanding more land than the approximately 26 per cent which has been allocated to them. The mediators, however, have stressed that the Moslems were mainly city-dwellers and therefore occupied much less land than might have been warranted by the size of their population. The Serbs, who have been assigned about 43 per cent of the territory of Bosnia, clearly do not want to give up the additional 27 per cent, which they now occupy as the result of their military conquests and policy of 'ethnic cleansing.' But they might be prepared to do a deal which would at least ensure that their provinces are joined up by land corridors across Croatian terri tory. At the back of the Bosnian Serbs' minds is that, one day, they will still be able to create an independent Bosnian Serb republic, in spite of the fact that the future constitution of Bosnia-Hercegovina rules out such a solution, unless it is approved by the central government.

0,FT923-13361 ,"FT923-13361 _AN-CGNBPADMFT 920714   FT  14 JUL 92 / Rabin asks Arab leaders for talks in Israel: Israeli premier says he is ready to visit Mideast capitals in search for peace      By HUGH CARNEGY   MR YITZHAK RABIN, the new Israeli prime minister, yesterday said he was willing to fly to the capitals of neighbouring Arab states in the search for Middle East peace. He also invited their leaders to Jerusalem. His initiative was welcomed in Washington but treated sceptically in the Arab world. President George Bush said he had invited Mr Rabin to the US next month and would send Mr James Baker, secretary of state, to Israel and its neighbours next week to spur along the peace process. In his opening speech to the Israeli parliament, Mr Rabin said: 'In the service of peace, I am prepared to travel to Amman, Damascus and Beirut, today, tomorrow. For there is no greater victory than the victory of peace.' He invited a joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegation to Jerusalem for informal talks and suggested that King Hussein of Jordan and the presidents of Syria and Lebanon address Israel's parliament. But his invitations were in large measure rhetorical flourishes which are likely to be turned down by the Arabs. The Jordanian government last night dismissed the invitation to Jerusalem as 'just talk'. The Palestinians are wary of Mr Rabin, and Arab leaders will want to continue the peace talks on neutral ground, in Rome, within the next two months. Mrs Hanan Ashrawi, a leading member of the Palestinian negotiating team, said Mr Rabin's speech 'had important points and signals a willingness to deal with issues seriously'. But she added: 'We need concrete proof of the seriousness of their intent.' In contrast to the uncompromising attitude of Mr Yitzhak Shamir, his predecessor, Mr Rabin called on Israelis to recognise that the world had undergone profound changes which presented opportunities for peace. 'We must overcome the sense of isolation that has held us in its thrall for almost half a century,' he said. 'We must join the international movement toward peace, reconciliation and co-operation that is spreading over the entire globe these days - lest we be the last to remain, all alone, in the station.' Mr Rabin, leader of the Labour party, which won last month's general election, was presenting to parliament his three-party coalition, which succeeds the two-year-old government led by Mr Shamir's Likud party. Labour has been joined in government by Meretz, an alliance of pro-peace groups, and Shas, an ultra-orthodox religious party, and is also supported by two Arab parties. The coalition won approval in parliament with a comfortable majority of 67-53. The new prime minister, resuming a post he last held in 1977, reiterated the coalition's commitment to accelerate the regional peace talks launched last October in Madrid. He urged the Palestinians to accept an interim period of self-rule in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, followed by talks on a final settlement. 'You will not get everything you want. Neither will we,' he said. 'Don't lose this opportunity that may never return. Take our proposal seriously - to avoid further suffering, humiliation and grief.'

0,FT933-3296 ,"FT933-3296 _AN-DIOCVAABFT 930915   FT  15 SEP 93 / Israel and Jordan take step to full peace treaty      By MARK NICHOLSON and JULIAN OZANNE      WASHINGTON, JERUSALEM   JORDAN yesterday initialled an outline peace agreement with Israel, becoming the first Arab state to reach an understanding with the Jewish state since Egypt signed a full peace with its neighbour in 1979. Just a day after Israel signed its outline agreement with the Palestinians, both countries initialled what they described as an 'agenda' framing future negotiations towards an eventual peace treaty. Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, meanwhile sought to build on the momentum for peace by visiting Morocco for talks with King Hassan, while Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, met Senate leaders in Washington before travelling on to the United Nations in New York. In Rabat, a spokesman for Mr Rabin commented: 'It is the first time an Israeli prime minister has met an Arab leader out in public, other than the Egyptian leaders.' During an hour's meeting with about 20 senators, Mr Arafat requested a review and repeal of laws that impeded or prevented economic or other relationships between the US and the PLO and repeated his strong commitment to peace. Mr George Mitchell, the Senate majority leader, said the general reaction among senators was to be helpful and that laws should be changed where needed. In sharp contrast to Monday's ceremonials on the White House lawn, the Jordan agreement was initialled by Mr Elyakim Rubinstein, head of the Israeli delegation to the peace talks, and Mr Fayez Tarawneh, his Jordanian counterpart in the small Thomas Jefferson room in the State Department. The modest affair took just over 10 minutes, after which the two signatories shook hands without hesitation or embarrassment. A small group of State Department officials applauded. A draft text covering the outstanding issues between the two sides has been virtually ready to sign since last year. Jordan, however, delayed a final signing until progress had been made on the Palestinian-Israel negotiations. The document contains undertakings from both sides to refrain from threats to each other's security and sets out the main areas for future discussion - notably on water rights, minor outstanding border issues and the status of refugees. 'We hope this is just a first step, which will follow into an agreement based on comprehensive peace,' said Mr Tarawneh. The document calls for 'steps to arrive at a state of peace based on Security Council resolutions 242 and 338' - which demand an Israeli withdrawal from the territories occupied since the 1967 war - indicating that Jordan is unlikely to sign a full peace deal with Israel until the Jewish state has done so with others. In Israel there were mounting signs yesterday that Mr Rabin would face an uphill struggle to win the parliamentary votes he says he needs to pass the peace agreement, perhaps forcing him to call a referendum. Mr Arye Deri, leader of the ultra-orthodox Shas party, which has effectively quit the Labour-led coalition, said he had recommended the party's spiritual mentor to demand a referendum be held on the same day as local elections due on November 3. Mr Deri also said he had instructed the interior ministry, which he headed until his resignation took effect yesterday, to make preparations for a November referendum. So far there has been no government decision on a referendum. Two Palestinians died in further violence in the occupied Gaza Strip yesterday, including a suicide bomber who blew himself up in an Israeli police station in an apparent protest at the peace deal. Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, welcomed the outline deal between Jordan and Israel as a 'signpost of the progress we hope and expect will soon come' in peace talks involving Syria and Lebanon.

0,FT943-6016 ,"FT943-6016 _AN-EIAD1ABTFT 940901   FT  01 SEP 94 / The IRA Ceasefire: Limits of republican patience may soon be tested - Nationalists      By TIM COONE   When the 'troubles' began in Northern Ireland 25 years ago, graffiti appeared on walls in nationalist areas in Belfast and Derry saying 'IRA = I Ran Away'. That taunt against the old IRA, which did not want to be drawn into sectarian conflict with Protestants, provided the rallying cry for a new generation of republicans who wanted to revive the armed struggle, largely dormant since the 1950s. The Provisional IRA split with the Official IRA and has been at the forefront of the conflict ever since. That new generation is today's old generation, which yesterday announced an end to its 25-year campaign with a view to joining a purely political battle for the goal of a united Ireland. But if Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, is unable to make political headway there can be little doubt that hardliners will begin to question the value of the ceasefire. And, if it collapses, the position of Mr Gerry Adams as Sinn Fein leader and prime mover of its 'peace strategy' will inevitably fall into question. If loyalist paramilitaries think that an eventual participation of Sinn Fein in negotiations is leading to significant political concessions to nationalists, they may well decide to escalate their own military actions to undermine the ceasefire, rather than respond in kind to it, as they are being urged to do. The 'I Ran Away' taunt could then return to haunt the leaders of Sinn Fein and the IRA, and create pressure for action in defence of nationalist communities - or in the worst of scenarios, a replay of the 1970s split that saw the 'Officials' enter mainstream politics and the young militants carry on the war. There is little doubt in the minds of the security forces that the IRA is a tightly disciplined organisation. Its 'active service units' operate in small cells. Their weapons are controlled through a separate quartermaster division, and bunkered in secret sites in the republic and Ulster. The quartermasters are controlled by the IRA's ruling body, its Army Council. The possibility of 'maverick' units rejecting the ceasefire and operating independently of the Army Council is minimal - although not impossible if weaponry exists outside the control of the leadership. The IRA is believed to have some 700 automatic rifles, a considerable stock of machine-guns, millions of rounds of ammunition, two to three tons of Semtex explosive, plus copious supplies of home-made fertiliser-based explosive as well as its own-design mortars. Senior republican officials have repeatedly stressed that the IRA and Sinn Fein leaderships are moving in tandem on the peace process, and that the possibility of a rupture will not arise, either between the organisations or within them. Some councillors from the Catholic community in Belfast, however, believe the IRA leadership is prepared to call off the ceasefire if loyalist killings escalate and the security forces are unable to contain them. Some 200 republicans are said to have been warned by the RUC that loyalists have details of them. Sinn Fein blames this leakage of intelligence information on renegade elements within the security forces sympathetic to the loyalist paramilitaries. The IRA's commitment to the ceasefire is, therefore, likely to be in part determined by how the security forces respond to any upsurge in loyalist violence. Attempts by armed republican splinter groups - such as the INLA and the IPLO  -to pick up hardline support from within the IRA by continuing the war are considered to be limited because of their shortage of weaponry and the debilitation of their leadership by internal feuding. The IRA has also been willing to act ruthlessly against its rivals, if it felt its own territory was being invaded or its leading role threatened. It is thought that its recent killing of a gangland boss in Dublin may be linked to the IRA asserting its authority and discipline within the armed republican movement. There was a firm belief in political circles in Dublin yesterday that the IRA is committed to a permanent cessation of violence. But the rapidity with which the Irish government has moved to reassure Sinn Fein that it will be quickly incorporated into political talks indicates Dublin's appreciation that IRA patience has its limits.

The self-styled Bosnian Serb parliament, called to a special session at Bileca, spurned a resolution that would have allowed conditional acceptance of the peace plan for Bosnia-Hercegovina. The resolution, proposed by Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, was branded by deputies as 'too moderate'. It was cast aside without a vote. Mr Karadzic had poured scorn on the map proposed by the mediators, Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, dividing Bosnia into 10 semi-autonomous provinces. But he argued that the boundaries proposed were 70-80 per cent acceptable. He called for direct talks between the three warring parties in Bosnia to reduce the disputed territory to 10 per cent. It was not worth 'killing each other' over such a small area, he said. 'By this resolution we do not accept the maps,' Mr Karadzic argued. 'What we are saying is: peace yes, talks yes, but the maps not yet.' But unconvinced, the deputies formed a commission to reword the resolution in stiffer terms for today's session. The Serb forces occupy 70 per cent of Bosnian territory, hundreds of thousands of Moslems having fled or been expelled from their homes. Mr Karadzic warned of the probable consequences of a negative vote by the Bosnian Serb parliament on the Vance-Owen plan. It was likely to lead to sharper sanctions, arming the outgunned Moslem forces, and even to foreign military intervention, he said. In a move to put pressure on the Serbs to sign the peace plan, the UN Security Council on Wednesday had approved a resolution to allow Nato warplanes to shoot down aircraft flouting a five-month-old ban on flights in Bosnian airspace. Nato permanent representatives agreed in Brussels yesterday to send US, British, French and Dutch fighters to enforce the no-fly zone. Mr Manfred Worner, Nato secretary-general, said the plans to send the warplanes would be ready less than two weeks from now. Sarajevo Radio reported 'bitter fighting' yesterday around Srebrenica, the besieged Moslem town in eastern Bosnia. It claimed that Serb forces launched artillery, tank and mortar barrages against the town. The radio said government forces repelled a Serb infantry attack. Elsewhere in Bosnia, a five-day-old ceasefire held with only minor violations, though snipers were reported to have killed one person and wounded four in Sarajevo. Meanwhile, Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, Norwegian foreign minister, announced in Oslo he had agreed to take over from Mr Vance as the UN peace mediator on the former Yugoslavia, joining Lord Owen, the European Community representative. The minister will probably take up the job at the end of this month, after the peace negotiations have moved back to Geneva from New York.   Countries:-  BAZ  Bosnia-Hercegovina, East Europe.

At the talks, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Panov and  Japanese Deputy Foreign Minister Fukuda exchanged wide-ranging  views on international issues and the situation in the  Asia-Pacific region, and discussed bilateral issues. At the  talks they also discussed future steps the two countries should  take to conclude a peace treaty, and ways to resolve bilateral  issues. Moscow Radio commentator Yuriy Afonin comments on the  outcome of the talks:    [Begin recording] The talks drew a great deal of attention  in both Russia and Japan because they were held to exchange  views between the two countries for the first time since  President Yeltsin visited Japan. The world is now faced with  many important issues. One of the issues is the Russian  parliamentary elections that resulted in concerns over Russia's  future foreign policy. At the talks, both sides affirmed the  validity of an agreement that was signed by the leaders of  Russia and Japan when President Yeltsin visited Japan last  October. In other words, both sides affirmed a genuine  partnership between the two countries. With the Moscow talks,  Russia-Japan political dialogue has now entered a new stage and  set the future direction of Russia-Japan relations. At the  talks both sides agreed in principle that Foreign Minister Hata  will visit Russia in March this year to hold talks with his  Russian counterpart in accordance with a Tokyo Declaration  provision on the revitalization of political dialogue between  the two countries. The schedule for Foreign Minister Hata's  visit to Russia is to be decided through diplomatic channels.    It can be said that preparations have now begun for  improving  Russia-Japan relations. At the talks, both sides agreed to hold  a meeting of the Intergovernmental Cooperation Committee on  Economy, Science and Technology in April, at the earliest. The  talks focused on discussion of ways to conclude a peace treaty.  The two countries should consistently take steps toward  resolving bilateral issues in order to normalize their  relations. The two countries also should cooperate closely in  deepening mutual understanding between their people, and in  creating a good environment in the two countries. The two  countries will prepare proposals aimed at reaching agreement on  certain issues when Foreign Minister Hata visits Russia. The  closeness and similarity of the two countries' positions on  international matters and issues in the Asia-Pacific region are  of great significance to the future of relations between Russia  and Japan. This will serve to expand their cooperation in the  United Nations and the international community, just as they  cooperated in Cambodia.    There are many common positions between Russia and Japan on  the issue of the Korean peninsula. The two countries will also  attend a conference on ASEAN security in Bangkok in July this  year. At the Moscow talks, both sides agreed on a common  approach to the issue of security in the Asia-Pacific region.  It can be said that the Russia-Japan vice foreign ministerial  talks took a concrete step toward strengthening the relations of  trust between the two countries.

The most important of these is the credibility of Prime  Minister Chuan Likphai, which remains intact despite the fact  that, almost without exception, his subordinates, including  Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri, have made comments harmful to  Thai-Cambodian relations.    Although beset with domestic problems, Chuan should not  remain idle over such an important foreign policy issue.    The prime minister, still respected to some degree by  Cambodian leaders, should take this opportunity to offer  Thailand, specifically Phatthaya or Hua Hin, as a neutral venue  for peace talks.    In July 1991, a similar feeling of despair over peace  prospects prevailed among Cambodian leaders. Then Thai Prime  Minister Anan Panyarachun, equally burdened with domestic issues  at the time, agreed to host the historic Phatthaya peace talks  which led to the signing of the Paris peace accords. For Anan,  it was a great risk, but it was one that paid off.    Last week, King Norodom Sihanouk suggested Paris or Jakarta  as possible venues for the roundtable. In principle, these two  locations are ideal as France and Indonesia were cochairmen of  the Paris International Conference on Cambodia, which brought an  end to the conflict in that country. However, in practice, it  is still very difficult to see how the proposed talks could take  place there. It would be too costly and too far away.    As Cambodia's next door neighbour, Thailand should take up  the challenge to host the meeting and help the Cambodian  factions achieve national reconciliation as soon as possible.  Otherwise, the ongoing fighting between the Cambodian and Khmer  Rouge troops would continue to affect the Thai villagers at the  border and worse, it could draw Thailand into the undesirable  war -- especially at a time when the Thai military leaders are  extremely frustrated with the border situation.    More than ever before, Thailand can play a useful role in  the  upcoming talks among the Cambodian faction. Since the  UN-sponsored election in May last year, which led to the  formulation of the current Cambodian government, Thailand has  been labelled as a pariah, primarily because of its relations  with the Khmer Rouge. The country has been repeatedly condemned  for its past links with the Marxist group. This trend will  continue as long as Thailand's lackadaisical attitude towards  the issue remains unchanged.    By hosting the peace talks, Thailand can demonstrate its  goodwill and neutrality, even though it will still be tough to  convince all the parties involved. If needs be, the Thai  authorities can take the opportunity to answer the allegations  levelled against the country.    Furthermore, Thai leaders would have the chance to exchange  views with all the Cambodian leaders on their own soil. They  can settle past misunderstandings, deliberate or not, and begin  a new dialogue to build up mutual trust and confidence.    In the past, Thailand frequently acted as an intermediary in  the Cambodian conflict, but that was when the country still had  the creditability. As Chuan is the only Thai leader with such  credentials, it is only an overture from him that will overcome  the Cambodians' recalcitrance and hold the roundtable in  Thailand.    Chuan should play a positive role in forging a  reconciliation  in Cambodia as it would greatly boost Thailand's wounded  international image. Helping Cambodia is to help Thailand. For  too long, the Cambodian situation has been handled by an  arrogant and myopic foreign minister, who has failed to  understand the sensitivities of the Cambodian issue or even  muster support from within the military. What the country needs  most now is a show of assertiveness from Chuan in foreign policy  because it is he who commands the respect of the military  leaders, and he who could make a difference in shaping  Thailand's Cambodian policy. Thailand has a high stake in the  future of a Cambodia which is at peace and friendly. Bangkok's  current problems with the Cambodian government have been the  accumulative result of developments that go back two decades.  More specifically, since 1979, Thailand has enjoyed all the  possible advantages from the war-shattered economy of Cambodia,  now it is the time to pay something back.    It is useless to continue this poisonous war of words. The  fate of these two countries are sealed together like a Siamese  twin. They have to learn how to coexist and coordinate with one  another, otherwise both of them will suffer a slow death.     "

The Northern Ireland secretary's comments coincided with the strongest hint yet by Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, that the IRA would not renounce its 25-year armed struggle without such clarification. Mr Adams told the Irish News, a Belfast-based nationalist newspaper: 'I said always what I wanted at the end of this peace process was to end up with a package, a proposition I can bring to the IRA in which hopefully I can make a definitive point which will lead them to change their campaign. I don't have such a package; I don't have such a proposition.' Pressure on the UK government to respond to Sinn Fein's demands has been mounting in recent days, with many leading politicians indicating they think the request is reasonable. Mr John Major, prime minister, has said the demands are 'an increasingly desperate attempt to avoid facing up to the clear choice that confronts them'. Mr Adams last night wrote to Mr Major on the subject. Downing Street last night confirmed that Mr Major had invited Mr John Hume, leader of Ulster's mainly Roman Catholic Social Democratic and Labour Party, for a meeting soon after parliament resumes on Monday. In a move likely to be welcomed by Ulster Unionists, the government also signalled that Mr Michael Ancram, the newly promoted Northern Ireland minister, is to press ahead with talks with leaders of the province's four constitutional political parties within the next two weeks. Meanwhile, pressure mounted on Mr Adams and Mr Hume to publish details of their agreement last year which played a large part in getting the current peace initiative under way after a Dublin newspaper reported the Sinn Fein president had agreed to the principle of majority consent for any constitutional change in the province's status. Mr Hume and Mr Adams both dismissed the reports yesterday as speculation. A Roman Catholic man seriously wounded late on Thursday night was the first victim of loyalist terrorists since the joint declaration was published three weeks ago.

Mr Reynolds' proposals for a 'united Ireland by consent', and active British involvement in that aim, are central to the peace formula that he intends to discuss with Mr Major in Dublin today. Although Dublin officials were yesterday emphasising that they still hoped for progress, the statements cast further gloom on Mr Reynolds' aspirations for 'peace by Christmas'. One of the main concessions Mr Reynolds seeks is is a statement by London supporting 'self determination of the Irish people based on consent freely expressed, north and south'. This would guarantee a majority veto in Northern Ireland to any change, but would also give nationalists the satisfaction of an all-Ireland dimension. Like London, Dublin is convinced that the IRA is ready to end its military campaign. But it is convinced that Britain will have to do more than simply demand a unilateral republican ceasefire. A clue as to why Dublin has such faith in its formula lies in a recent speech by Mr Gerry Adams, the leader of Sinn Fein, who said: 'Partition was brought about by a British act of parliament for which not a single Irish vote was cast. The consent of the Irish people was never sought and has never been freely given. That is the nub of our problems.' Dublin officials have made little effort in the past week to disguise their exasperation with Downing Street and their concern that Mr Major's 'understanding' with the Ulster Unionists is the main obstacle to progress on their own formula.

Tomorrow Israel and the Palestinians are to resume  talks on the Gaza-Jericho First plan. Tomorrow night, the  Israeli delegations to the Washington peace talks are to fly to  the American capital for the resumption of those negotiations on  Tuesday [15 February].    Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres says Syria has not softened  its demand for a complete Israeli withdrawal from the Golan  Heights. On the Palestinian track, Peres says he continues to  oppose a Palestinian state, and prefers a Palestinian-Jordanian  confederation.    A senior Foreign Ministry official says PLO Chairman 'Arafat  spoke bitterly of Jordan King Husayn in Cairo last week, and  there is concern that the establishment of a Palestinian state  will bring about a civil war. David Ze'ev reports:    The Israeli officials say the resumption of the negotiations  in Taba between Israel and the PLO can be divided into two  categories: issues that were agreed upon in principle in Cairo,  that must now be finalized; and other matters less dramatic,  which nevertheless must be resolved. The Cairo issues that must  be worked out in greater detail include the administrative  running of border crossings and joint patrols on roads in the  area. [passage omitted]    A senior diplomatic official says Israel is inclined to try  to ease the pressure on the Palestinians, saying there is no  point, for example, in pressing the PLO to abolish the clauses  in its charter calling for the destruction of Israel. The  senior official said the Palestine National Council, which must  take the step, is inoperative, and Chairman 'Arafat certainly  does not have a two-thirds majority in the council, as required,  to make the changes. [Jerusalem Israel Television Network  Channel 1 in Hebrew at 1800 GMT on 13 February reports that  speaking at the 13 February cabinet meeting, the foreign  minister warned that 'Arafat must not be weakened too much, lest  we render him unable to control Gaza and Jericho  satisfactorily.""]    As Israel's teams to the Washington peace talks prepare to  set out for the American capital, Foreign Minister Peres has  repeated that there will be no progress with Syria as long as  Damascus refuses to raise the level of the talks. A high-level  Foreign Ministry official says Jerusalem has complained to the  Americans that when the Syrians say a comprehensive peace, they  really mean a comprehensive price for Israel to pay.    Israeli and Jordanian negotiators were in touch directly in  advance of their talks. Chief Israeli negotiator Elyaqim  Rubinstein says the scope of those negotiations is widening. In  the Foreign Ministry they would not comment on whether Jordan  might sign a peace agreement with Israel once a final agreement  is reached with the Palestinians on the Gaza-Jericho First plan.

As the personal envoy of the Russian president continues his  talks in the region about the peace process, there is talk that  the American secretary of state will make a new Middle East tour  by mid- June to break the logjam in the peace process and  possibly to work out a date to restart the bilateral talks.    Israel's posture on the peace process is as negative and  rejectionist as ever, and it continues to pursue separate and  incomplete deals, thus locking Washington's and Moscow's efforts  into a vicious circle.    Syria has made it clear over and over that it is committed  to  the principles and bases of the peace process as laid out by UN  resolutions. Israel's recognition of its failure to promote a  separate settlement with Lebanon, Syria, or Jordan is evidence  that the peace process needs to proceed along the principles and  bases on which it was launched.    It is vital that the way to deal with the equivocating and  temporizing Rabin government be rethought. This is because  neither the peace process nor the general state of affairs in  the Middle East is advanced by Israel's tactics of buying time,  AL-BA'TH concludes.     "

A senior Bush Administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,  said this week's progress toward peace in Cambodia ""increases the possibility""  the United States will normalize ties with Vietnam. But he indicated the  Administration is not ready to take such a step until there is further progress  toward an end to Cambodia's civil war.    Since the Vietnam War ended 15 years ago, the United States has maintained a  policy of isolating the government in Hanoi. The United States maintains a  trade embargo against Vietnam and has no diplomatic relations with its  government.    Last year, after Vietnam withdrew most of its troops from Cambodia, the Bush  Administration said it would be prepared to move toward normal ties with  Vietnam, but only after the Hanoi government helped to bring about a peace  settlement in Cambodia. The current government in Phnom Penh was installed when  Vietnamese troops invaded Cambodia at the end of 1978.    On Monday, at a meeting in Jakarta, Indonesia, the four warring parties in  Cambodia took a historic step toward such a peace settlement when they agreed  to share power in a Supreme National Council that would run the country until  the United Nations can arrange a cease-fire and conduct free elections. The  Cambodian government, headed by Premier Hun Sen, said for the first time that  it is willing to go along with this power-sharing arrangement.    Lang asserted in the interview on Monday that Vietnam has been ""doing its best""  to bring about a peace settlement as soon as possible. ""We have spared no  effort in that direction,"" he said. As a result, he said, Vietnam has met the  conditions set by the United States for normal diplomatic relations.    ""Whether the United States keeps its word in normalizing relations or not, that  is the decision of the United States,"" he said. ""Conditions are put after  conditions. . . . We believe there should be normalization of relations between  the two countries sooner, sooner. Of course, it doesn't depend on one side. It  depends on both sides.""    A senior U.S. official said it is not yet clear how important a role Vietnam  played in persuading Hun Sen and his Cambodian government to go along with the  United Nations plan for a sharing of power.    ""We don't know what Vietnam told Hun Sen and what the Soviets told him,"" the  official said. ""But Jakarta was a significant advance forward, and Vietnam  didn't obstruct the process. The Vietnamese were certainly not a negative  factor, and they may have been a positive factor.""    Normalization of relations with Vietnam ""is not center stage on the U.S. agenda  right now,"" the official said. However, he added, ""we would move step by step  with them toward normalization as they help make this (the proposed Cambodian  peace settlement) work.""    Many analysts believe Vietnam is eager to forge new ties with the United States  because of its need for Western investment to shore up its impoverished economy  and because of its fear of losing aid from the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.    However, Lang argued that normalizing U.S.-Vietnamese relations would be ""in  the interest of both countries, politically and economically.""    ""The U.S. objective in Southeast Asia is peace, stability and security of the  whole area. We also have the same objective,"" Lang said.

0,FT911-4872 ,"FT911-4872 _AN-BDQBPAD8FT 910417   FT  17 APR 91 / Israel defies US by starting new settlement      By HUGH CARNEGY and VICTOR MALLET      JERUSALEM, LONDON   ISRAELI settlers yesterday began moving into the first Jewish settlement to be established in the occupied West Bank for two years in direct defiance of US warnings that such actions could jeopardise its efforts to broker a Middle East peace accord. The government-financed settlers said they had deliberately moved forward plans to occupy the settlement - originally given official approval as a settlement site eight years ago - to take place before Mr James Baker, the US secretary of state, returns to Israel later this week to pursue proposals for Arab-Israeli peace negotiations. Last night the White House said the settlement was an obstacle to the peace process. More than a dozen mobile homes, acquired through the Housing Ministry run by Mr Ariel Sharon, a vocal opponent of Mr Baker's peace proposals, were transported overnight to the settlement site, called Revava, where several families prepared to move in immediately. The settlers fear peace talks could undermine Israeli rule over the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Ministers in the government of Mr Yitzhak Shamir, which supports settlement and has rejected Washington's view that they are an obstacle to peace, refused to distance themselves from yesterday's move. Mr Shamir says there is no link between settlements and the peace process. In London yesterday, Mr Shamir likened the Israeli settlers in the territories to Arab residents of Israel proper and said it was normal for people to build houses. 'It doesn't make any difference if there will be in these disputed territories 100 settlements or 120 settlements,' he told a news conference. 'The permanent political solution will be accepted outside this fact.' Mr Shamir yesterday met Mr Valentin Pavlov, the Soviet prime minister, in a sign of the improving relations between the two countries. But the Israeli premier was unable to say if the Soviet Union would agree to Israel's demand that full diplomatic ties be restored if Moscow wishes to join Washington in supervising a proposed regional Middle East peace conference. 'It is absolutely necessary that before a meeting the Soviet Union will establish with Israel normal diplomatic relations. . . Mr Pavlov told me that they will think about it and consider it.' In Israel, Mr Ehud Olmert, the health minister, said he agreed the establishment of Revava was awkwardly timed, but added: 'On the other hand, if indeed settlements are a vital component of government policy, it is better not to play hide and seek.' This attitude infuriates the Palestinians, who told Mr Baker last week that they could not take the proposition of peace talks with Israel seriously as long as settlement continued. Some 100,000 Jews now live in the West Bank and Gaza, a figure that rose by about 10 per cent last year. Israeli opposition groups also bitterly condemned the new settlement. '(Revava) is a provocation against the peace process and it is meant to deter any Arab who wants to talk peace with Israel today. . . and to lead us to the next war,' said Mr Ran Cohen, Citizens Rights Movement MP.

If  the U.S. president really made this statement, and there are  indications that he did, this means that the current U.S.  Administration has adopted a stance contrary to official U.S.  positions on Jerusalem advocated by previous administrations.  In addition such a stance is a flagrant violation of  international legitimacy and resolutions relating to the  Arab-Israeli conflict.    This stance also affirms that the U.S. Administration cannot  play the role of honest broker in the peace talks, especially  when the Palestinian-Israeli accord has clearly specified that  the status of Jerusalem will be at the top of the list of issues  to be discussed during the final stage talks between the  Palestinian and Israeli sides.    This position, attributed to Clinton, was preceded by the  U.S. abstention in the Security Council vote on a clause  affirming that Jerusalem was part of the occupied Palestinian  territories. The vote was within context of a resolution on the  al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. On this basis, Clinton's recent  statement is not separate from the U.S. position's farce in the  Security Council during the deliberations over the massacre and  from what he stated during his election campaign.    Therefore, those voices which considered Clinton's  statements  during the election campaign as being mere lip service to gain  the American Jewish vote in the elections should now realize  their mistake. They should also realize that what is happening  now is a clear shift in the U.S. position -- one that seeks to  be in harmony with the Israeli position and that ignores and  denies the rights of the Palestinian people and the Arab and  Islamic nations in Jerusalem.    In sum, a U.S. stance that is so clear and grave on a  central  problem in the Arab-Israeli conflict calls for a serious  assessment of the U.S. role in the peace talks. The U.S.  Administration's continued fulfillment of the sponsor's role in  the peace talks while adopting Israel's positions means that it  has lost any credibility in playing such a role and that it has  lost the legitimacy of intervening in the talks, especially as  it has defied international legitimacy and its resolutions, on  which the foundations of the peace process are based.

But Mr John Major, the prime minister, will today tell Mr Albert Reynolds, his Irish counterpart, that an explicit pledge by Dublin to modify the republic's constitutional claim to the province is vital to any hope of an agreement. British officials insist that it will be impossible to restart talks between the constitutional parties without a commitment by the republic to incorporate into article two of its constitution the principle of majority consent in Ulster to any change in the status of the province. Moderate unionist leaders have made it clear that they will not participate in a resumption of the 'three-strand' search for a political settlement without such a pledge from Dublin. But Mr Reynolds has been reluctant to give any firm commitment in advance of the conclusion of an overall accord between unionists and nationalists. As a result, talks between London and Dublin on a framework document to restart the talks process have become deadlocked. Mr Major and Mr Reynolds will seek to break that deadlock at their meeting today on the margins of the European summit in Brussels. In spite of recent gloom in both capitals about the prospect of a breakthrough before the Anglo-Irish summit pencilled in for late next week, officials in London have not ruled out the possibility that the two prime ministers will find a compromise. The expectation is that if they do not the summit will be postponed until September. British officials say that Mr Reynolds' recent public calls for changes in the Ireland Act have not yet been matched by specific suggestions for amendments. There is also some puzzlement as to why Dublin regards that legislation  - which predates the division of Ireland - as such an important symbol of Irish partition. The 1973 Northern Ireland Act is a much clearer assertion of Westminster's sovereignty over the province. The view in London is that as long as the principle of consent is not undermined the government is ready to consider changes to the 1920 legislation as part of a package to restart the process. Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, told the Commons yesterday that he saw no particular need for changes but was ready to consider any proposals. It is understood that the liaison group drawing up the proposed framework document has still to settle the form of the new cross-border groups demanded by nationalist politicians in the province as a quid pro quo for the creation of a new Ulster assembly. Some differences remain over the degree to which the two governments should seek to prescribe the form of devolved administration. The London government appears confident that they could quickly be resolved if Mr Major and Mr Reynolds break the deadlock over the constitutional claim. By contrast there appears little optimism in London about the prospects for an early end to violence in the province. Intelligence reports suggest that the latest escalation in attacks by the IRA might represent a deliberate show of strength as the precursor to a temporary ceasefire. The government still believes that the faction represented by Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, is looking for an escape route from the violence to allow it to join the talks process. But the apparent determination of hardline sections of the IRA to continue the killing has all but extinguished hopes of a quick 'clean' break with the past 25 years.

[Velayati] In the name of God, the compassionate, the  merciful [preceding phrase in Arabic]. The main problem is the  lack of mutual understanding, which has been available since the  very beginning of negotiations. But this problem needs time to  be solved. I mean, if we want to solve this problem we need  more time. If you take a look at the result of the talks that  they had in Moscow and also the preliminary statement that they  had in ceremonial session, you will see that may be there are  some progress. As I said in my interview, at the beginning they  were not ready to talk together. And both of them used to be  very angry against another one. Now the nature of their  presence is a positive step which has been taken by them. So we  can say that cautiously we are optimistic and we do hope that  after few days of talks they can reach some more positive  points. This is the national desire of the people of  Tajikistan. They want to put an end to these internal conflict  because they have lost many lives and they are facing, the  people of Tajikistan are facing a national disaster. They have  difficulties even for providing the raw material for their very  simple life. Lack of sanitation, lack of food, lack of  transportation, continuation of killing and slaughters and  assassination have made the people of Tajikistan frustrated.  People are very disappointed. That is the national desire that  now the time is ripe for a national reconciliation.    [Correspondent] It seems no specific plan for restoring  peace  in Tajikistan has been offered. Do you think a clear peace plan  will come under discussion in the current round of negotiations  in Tehran?    [Velayati] Of course, this is the task of the special envoy  of the secretary general of the United Nations. But as far as  we could understand of what he has said he has tried to make a  cease-fire at the beginning as a fist step; because the  establishment of the cease-fire will give opportunity to both  sides for continuation of talks and decreasing of tension; while  the continuation of assassination and killing and slaughters  will increase tension. And if tension is increased or is being  increased they cannot stop the hostility. So, the cease-fire is  the first step that should be established unconditionally,  without any precondition. That is what we could understand from  the special envoy of the secretary general of the United Nations.     "

Mr Gad Ben Ari, Mr Rabin's spokesman, said Egypt's ambassador in Israel had requested the meeting a few days ago. But he added: 'In terms of exact dates and in terms of location, nothing is set.' Mr Mubarak, who has emerged as the key intermediary in efforts to revive the stalled peace talks, meets President Bill Clinton tomorrow. Mr Mubarak said last week he would report the substance of his meeting to Mr Rabin on his return to Cairo. The Egyptian leader has recently met President Hafez al-Assad of Syria and Mr Yassir Arafat, the Palestine Liberation Organisation chairman. The PLO is meeting this week in Tunis to discuss possible measures to resolve the crisis over the Israeli mass deportation of Palestinians in December which has blocked the resumption of peace talks. The Palestinians have said they will not decide whether to attend the next round of talks, scheduled for April 20, until after Mr Mubarak's return from Washington. Mr Mubarak would particularly welcome a successful mediation effort at a time when his government is under strong pressure from Islamic fundamentalists at home. It would also underline Egypt's strategic value to Washington while the country is seeking a renewed US commitment to the Dollars 2.1bn it receives in annual civil and military aid. An Israeli-Egyptian summit would be unlikely without a solution being found to the peace talks impasse. In the event of a deal, Mr Mubarak could seek to extract the maximum symbolic publicity from his role by meeting Mr Rabin in Jerusalem. This would mark the first visit to Israel by President Mubarak since he took power more than a decade ago, and the first by any Egyptian leader since the historic trip of President Anwar Sadat in November 1977. A senior Egyptian foreign ministry official said Mr Mubarak had decided in principle to make such a visit, saying 'it is not a question of whether, but of when'. The official said Mr Mubarak would not have countenanced such a trip while Mr Yitzak Shamir, the former Likud prime minister, was in power.   Countries:-  ILZ  Israel, Middle East.

Speaking after a meeting with Mr John Major, the prime minister, Mr Hume said there would be 'peace within a week' if the initiative was embraced. 'My conclusion is that that is now a real possibility - a total cessation of violence, not a ceasefire,' Mr Hume said. But in a move likely to infuriate Unionists, whom London and Dublin are trying to lure back to the negotiating table, Mr Hume said he intended to brief Mr Adams on his hour-long meeting at Downing Street last night. The session was also attended by Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary. Mr Hume indicated afterwards it would no longer be possible for Sir Patrick to say he did not know details of the Hume-Adams initiative. Mr Major is seeing leaders of the province's four constitutional political parties over the next few days. Yesterday's meeting with Mr Hume was followed by a similar session with Mr John Alderdice of the Alliance party. It emerged yesterday that the Irish government believes it will become clear by early December if there is to be a breakthrough on the London-Dublin peace initiative for Northern Ireland announced by Mr Major and Mr Albert Reynolds, his Irish counterpart, in Brussels last week. Mr Reynolds told the Irish parliament he intended to meet Mr Major again on December 3, before the next meeting of the European Council, to discuss the peace process. Dublin also acted yesterday to clear up ambiguity over the six-point plan set out last week by Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister. One of Mr Spring's points was that Unionist consent would be required for any constitutional change in the north. But Mr Reynolds made it clear yesterday this was not intended as an additional concession. 'I would like to make it very clear that what we are talking about here is the consent of a majority to constitutional change, as precisely defined in Article 1 of the Anglo-Irish agreement,' he told the Irish parliament. 'The government have in no way departed from that position.' In the Commons, Mr John Smith, Labour leader, urged Mr Major to 'take the lead' in efforts to persuade the province's political leaders to return to talks, saying there was an 'inescapable moral obligation' on them to 'co-operate in a new dialogue'. Mr Major, who held cabinet discussions on Northern Ireland yesterday morning, said he intended to take 'a very direct interest' in efforts to bring about a lasting peace, while hinting that an early return to round-table talks was unlikely. 'I don't want to see an artificially staged event where the talks are called together with no probability of them making progress,' he said.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

And a transatlantic plea by SDLP [Social Democratic Labour  Party] leader John Hume for ministers to resume negotiations  with Sinn Fein met with a similar rebuff from Downing Street.    The message from the British Government to the men of  violence was stark and uncompromising in the wake of the three  terrorist mortar attacks on Heathrow Airport within the space of  five days and killings in Ulster. Downing Street seemed to  treat with contempt Mr Hume's implied suggestion that it was in  the IRA's favour that it was not their intention to detonate any  of the mortar bombs which rained into Heathrow in the three  attacks.    Mr Hume, who is in Boston, Massachusetts, drumming up  investment for Ulster, said: ""It was their intention to  demonstrate to the British Government what they are capable of,  so that if there is a total cessation of violence they are not  backing down or standing down from a position of weakness, but  from a position of strength.""    And he claimed that this was the best opportunity for peace  in 20 years.    But a senior Downing Street source said: ""It is deeply  offensive to people in Ireland and in Britain that the IRA  should claim to be interested in peace while continuing to kill  in cold blood and to mount acts of terror. This behaviour will  only reinforce the Government's resolve to stick with utter  determination to the course which we have chosen which has huge  support. We have not been waiting and we are not waiting for  the IRA in our efforts to achieve a lasting political settlement  which is acceptable to all the constitutional, democratic  parties.""    New top-level talks are planned between Dublin and London on  security cooperation, amid speculation that a crack-down is on  the way.    The Government continues to say that internment is not ruled  out, but its imposition could -- some believe -- destroy Albert  Reynolds, the Irish Premier.    Meanwhile, Heathrow was recovering from the chaos created by  the third attack on Sunday [13 March], and compounded by a  security shut-down overnight -- an alert which also closed down  Gatwick for a time.    The IRA itself also demanded new direct talks with the  Government, insisting there had to be discussions if there was  to be any chance of an end to the violence. They said they were  prepared to be flexible and positive, but the lines of  communication between the two sides would have to reopen.    But the message from Downing Street was that there was  absolutely no prospect of resuming negotiations or contact under  any kind of duress. The IRA overtures are seen by the  Government as a means of trying to force talks before any  commitment to end the violence.    The IRA came under attack from Mr Reynolds. ""This multiple  attack on Heathrow and indeed the closure of Gatwick is in my  view a gross miscalculation by the IRA. It is not going to  advance the peace process and it is certainly not going to do  anything to endear themselves to the general public.""    Mr Reynolds, who was speaking in New York, was at one with  John Major in insisting that the Downing Street declaration was  unaffected by this latest IRA campaign. [passage omitted]     "

At a joint news conference following the official talks,  Jovanovic said it had been agreed in the talks that sanctions  against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia had been made  redundant a long time ago by the huge and important changes that  had taken place in Bosnia itself and on the territory of former  Yugoslavia.    The two ministers pointed to the negative consequences of  the  NATO air strikes against Serb positions in Bosnia and NATO  siding with the Muslims. This action dealt a heavy blow to the  peace process and the political process in the region, Jovanovic  said, adding that now much more time and effort would be  necessary to put the peace process back on track.    The sanctions have been inflicting damage even on those who  designed and imposed them, Jovanovic said. He stressed there  was no longer anyone who would be ready to take part in this,  nor support the anachronism that was created in Bosnia and on  the territory of former Yugoslavia.    Greek Minister Karolos Papoulias, having expressed pleasure  over meeting Jovanovic again, pointed to the need for firmer  cooperation between the Balkan countries in resolving the issue  of sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.    Speaking about sanctions, Papoulias said there was ""scope  for  actions within the European Union."" However, he spoke more  about cooperation between the Balkan countries in that sphere,  which, as he said, should take joint action.    ""In a series of meetings with Bulgarian and Romanian  colleagues, we agreed we would work together on the problem of  sanctions,"" Papoulias said, convinced Hungary and Ukraine would  join such an action. He said at today's talks they also  discussed the idea of organizing an inter-Balkan conference on  cooperation between the states in the Balkan region that would  take place when peace was reached on the territory of the former  Yugoslavia. ""We have agreed with Minister Jovanovic to work in  this direction with the ministers of other Balkan states,""  Papoulias said, listing Romania, Bulgaria, and Hungary as first  partners in connection with the idea.    Minister Jovanovic expressed his gratitude to Greece and to  the Greek nation for the aid given to the Serb people. ""This aid  comes from the very soul, and that makes it even more precious,""  he said, stressing that the Serb and Greek nations were linked  by ties of friendship that could not be severed. Jovanovic  particularly expressed his gratitude in connection with an  action currently taking place in Greece for gathering millions  of signatures for a petition to suspend sanctions against the  FRY, which would be sent to UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali.    The Yugoslav minister said the policy of peace, dialogue,  and  agreement was a permanent orientation of the FRY. That is why  we are asking the international community to treat us on an  equal footing. Everything that has been imposed on the Serb  nation as a form of punishment must be removed to enable  negotiations on an equal basis. ""Talks cannot take place under  the threat of bombing or under political and economic pressure,""  Jovanovic said.    It is expected that Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou  will receive the Yugoslav foreign minister tomorrow morning.     "

During his meetings and talks with President Clinton and his  administration's officials, and with various economic, security,  and political U.S. institutions, His Majesty King Husayn managed  to confirm his knowledge and experience in managing crises and  confirmed that the Jordanian role in the region cannot in any  way be marginalized or ignored.    His Majesty King Husayn also persuaded the U.S.  Administration to take care of priorities and to work on  addressing the standing issues and problems with Israel before  talking about the possibility of reaching peace with it.  Through the U.S. Administration, he managed to convince Israel  of these requirements, which are the requirements for peace.  Therefore, an agreement must be reached on delineating borders  and restoring Jordan's share of water since it is a question of  sovereignty before anything else.    His Majesty King Husayn managed to explain to the U.S.  Administration and the U.S. Congress the economic and social  difficulties facing the country as a result of the second Gulf  War, the blockade of al-'Aqabah, and the Arab boycott and the  damage it has brought to the Jordanian economy. He stressed  that unless these issues are addressed, it will be difficult to  talk about peace and mutual goodwill in the bilateral ties.    His Majesty King Husayn succeeded in presenting all these  facts to President Clinton and his administration officials. He  received a positive response to his demand and an  acknowledgement of the soundness of his view and positions and  the sincerity of his intentions and tendencies.    Therefore, His Majesty King Husayn's visit to Washington and  his meetings and talks there were, by all standards, a success.    This success, however, particularly on the level of the  peace  talks, will not be at the expense of the Arab brothers or their  rights. Jordan has from the beginning been committed to, and  will continue to be committed to, the comprehensive peace.

Opening a new chapter in relations with Israel, Mr Mubarak met the recently elected Israeli prime minister, Mr Yitzhak Rabin, and said the two were committed to advancing peace efforts. The Egyptian leader has previously said he was prepared to travel to Israel when the time was right. 'Mr Rabin invited me but frankly speaking, I need no invitation,' Mr Mubarak said. 'My response is positive to Mr Rabin.' But Mr Mubarak made it clear that Egypt was expecting 'much more' from Israel towards halting settlement construction in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. Asked about the Rabin government's moves to freeze temporarily settlement activity, Mr Mubarak declared, with the Israel leader seated next to him: 'It is a good step on the right track and we appreciate it, yet we need much more. But we leave it to him now.' Neither leader mentioned any specific agreements about joint efforts to revitalise the peace process, but it seems likely the two will co-ordinate closely in the weeks ahead. Mr Rabin welcomed an Egyptian offer to host bilateral talks between Israel and her Arab neighbours, including Syria, Lebanon and a Jordanian-Palestinian team. But he indicated that the negotiations launched in Madrid last October would resume in Rome and may move to Cairo later. Mr Rabin, who is on his first trip abroad since being sworn in earlier this month, called on other Arab states to follow Egypt's example and make peace with Israel. 'I believe the time has arrived ..for other countries, for other peoples, to divert from war, from the course of confrontation, and embark on the course of peace,' he said. The Israeli Prime Minister laid a wreath at the tomb of the late President Anwar Sadat whose 1977 visit to Jerusalem opened the way to Egypt's peace with Israel in 1979. Mr Sadat, whose mission set off a firestorm of criticism in Arab capitals, was assassinated by Moslem extremists in 1981. The US Secretary of State, Mr James Baker, meanwhile, was exerting strong pressure on Arab states to make compromise gestures towards Israel as he continued his latest Middle East shuttle. Speaking in Jerusalem yesterday before leaving for visits to Arab capitals, Mr Baker said he would be 'carrying a message that in my view there is a new opportunity to move forward.' The Secretary of State, on visits to Jordan, Syria and Saudi Arabia in the next few days, seems likely to press the Arabs to consider lifting their economic boycott against Israel, among other goodwill gestures. His visit to Syria has been complicated by the death of President Hafez al-Assad's mother. His talks with the Syrian president have been put off until today - after Mr Baker has made a quick shuttle to Cairo for talks with President Mubarak. Mr Baker's return to the Middle East days after the installation of the new Rabin government indicates Washington's desire for swift progress towards a resumption of Middle East peace efforts. The Bush administration wants to smooth relations with the American-Jewish community before the November presidential elections by re-establishing warm ties with Israel, and achieving progress in Middle East peacemaking to add lustre to its foreign policy record.

In his turn, Rabin thanked Moscow for its active efforts to  help the gradual development of the Arab-Israeli negotiations  and stressed Israel's interest in expanding broad cooperation  with Russia in regional and international affairs.    ""The sides positively estimated bilateral relations and  stressed that the signing of important inter-governmental  documents during the visit creates a solid basis for their  further development,"" the statement said.    Rabin arrived in Moscow on Sunday for his first official  visit to Russia, only four days after Palestinian leader Yasir  'Arafat left Moscow.    On Monday, Rabin held talks with his Russian counterpart  Viktor Chernomyrdin and signed six documents on bilateral  cooperation in trade-economic, scientific-technical, cultural  and other fields.    He met with two speakers of the Russian parliament's lower  and upper houses, Ivan Rybkin and Vladimir Shumeyko.    On Tuesday morning, the Israeli prime minister met with  Yeltsin, and then with foreign minister Andrey Kozyrev and  Defense Minister Pavel Grachev respectively.

President Clinton said in the interview he gave to CNN that  his meeting in Geneva with Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad was  great and serious. He added that he is convinced that the  Syrian president is honest when confirming Syria's interest in  establishing peace and is committed to finding an agreement for  a settlement with Israel on the basis of peace prevailing on  both the Lebanese and Jordanian fronts, in addition to the  Palestinian-Israeli agreement.    The statements by the U.S. President came after he met twice  with Jordanian monarch King Husayn and before a series of  meetings that were held in Oslo between U.S. Secretary of State  Warren Christopher, Palestinian president Yasir 'Arafat, and  Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres.    The preparatory meetings start in Washington today between  the Arab delegations taking part in the bilateral peace talks  with Israel in preparation for resuming these negotiations at  the beginning of the next month, after they have been stopped  and stalled for a long time.    Since the United States gives priority to peace efforts in  the Middle East, we hope that the U.S. capital will soon witness  concurrent agreements between Israel and Syria, Lebanon, and  Jordan respectively along the lines of the Palestinian-Israeli  agreement, which will bring about a historic reconciliation and  an honorable and permanent peace through which cooperation and  good neighborliness can replace bloodshed and fighting.

But the IRA leadership insisted that it remained committed to the success of the peace process and said it had not sanctioned the raid. It blamed a 'fault' in its chain of command and apologised for the attack. Mr Frank Kerr was shot when masked raiders entered the sorting office in Newry and escaped with more than Pounds 130,000. It was the first killing by the IRA since its ceasefire started on September 1. A statement issued in Dublin said: 'Those carrying out the robbery were acting on instructions but the so-called operation had not been sanctioned by the IRA leadership.' It added: 'Responsibility for this incident lies with an identified problem in the army's chain of command and not with the volunteers involved. This has now been rectified.' The statement followed an investigation the IRA promised on November 12 when the organisation banned the use of firearms by its members. Two men appeared in court last Wednesday charged with the murder of Mr Kerr and stealing more than Pounds 130,000. Neither Downing Street nor the Northern Ireland Office would comment on the statement last night. The BBC reported that Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, had said he was disappointed at the IRA's involvement and added that it was now up to the IRA to ensure there was no repetition. Mr Peter Robinson MP, deputy leader of the Democratic Unionist party, urged Mr John Major, the prime minister, to 'wipe from his mind' immediately any thoughts of entering into dialogue with Sinn Fein. He accused the IRA of 'blatant hypocrisy'. In the same message, he said, they had admitted murdering Mr Kerr and expressed their devotion to the peace process. Earlier Mr Ken Maginnis MP, Ulster Unionist party security spokesman, said the IRA planned to launch an offensive of sporadic attacks under the guise of a breakaway group. Stewart Dalby in Belfast writes: The possibility of such a breakaway move had been dismissed at the weekend by Mr John Hume, leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party. His comments followed reports that an IRA faction based in South Armagh would split from the organisation and resume violence by March if Britain did not make significant constitutional concessions to the republican movement. He said: 'I have been at the centre of the (peace) process from the very beginning. I can tell you there are no deadlines for the IRA, no secret deals.' Earlier, Mr Hume said he firmly believed the ceasefires by the IRA and the loyalist paramilitaries would prove to be durable. He said: 'Peace and justice in the north transcend party politics in the south.'   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.     IEZ  Ireland, EC.   Industries:-  P9229 Public Order and Safety, NEC.

""Although we are going through a difficult time, we are  still  optimistic to a certain degree and we believe that the worst  will be avoided. That would be useful not only for the Balkans  but also for the whole of Europe,"" Papoulias said.    Describing his talks with President of Serbia Slobodan  Milosevic as ""cordial, as usual,"" Papoulias stressed that at  this moment in time it is extremely important to direct all  efforts toward finding a peaceful solution to the Bosnian  conflict, and also underlined that it is important that all the  key players accept the EU's peace plan.    Reminding journalists that Greece has reservations as  regards  the latest NATO decision on the ultimatum to the Bosnian Serbs,  Papoulias said -- stressing that he is speaking about this as  the Greek foreign minister, not as the EU chairman -- that  Greece has reservations essentially because it does not believe  that actions such as air attacks could contribute toward  achieving peace in Bosnia.    ""We insist on the resumption of negotiations, that is, on  finding a solution to the Bosnian conflict through negotiation,""  Papoulias said, emphasizing that the NATO decision on air  strikes was made against the wishes of the Greek Government.    Replying to numerous questions which exclusively referred to  the NATO threat against the Bosnian Serbs, the Greek foreign  minister said that, according to the latest information, the  process of withdrawing heavy weapons from the positions around  Sarajevo in under way, which is cause for hope, and that he sees  no reason for additional pressure on the Serbs.    ""I believe, however, that the withdrawal of heavy weapons is  not an obligation for the Bosnian Serbs alone. The same should  be done by Bosnian Muslims,"" Papoulias said, adding: ""Greek  policy is well known -- all the warring sides in Bosnia must  make the same concessions in order to restore peace and maintain  the EU peace initiative. As a country that holds the EU  presidency, Greece insists on this.""    What will Athens do if, nevertheless, air strikes take  place?    ""We are doing everything in our power to avoid the spread of  the war, because there is a real danger of the Bosnian crisis  spreading south. Should that happen, it would mean a dramatic  escalation of the conflict which would no longer be limited to  the Balkans but would also be a European conflict, given the  fact that nobody in that case could rule out the possibility of  the involvement of third parties.""    As EU president, is Greece is able to convene an urgent  session of the EU ministers before the NATO ultimatum expires?    ""Yes, this possibility exists and we are examining it,""  Papoulias briefly replied without going into details.    At the end of his news conference, the Greek foreign  minister  confirmed that the Belgian, German, and Greek foreign ministers  will meet in Athens tomorrow and that Andrey Kozyrev will be  joining them.    ""This is the usual practice of the EU troika (the former,  present and the future president), and dialogue with Russia fits  into this. However, one of the issues to which we will devote  attention will be the crisis in former Yugoslavia,"" Karolos  Papoulias said.     "

He hoped that the process that was launched from Madrid will  continue. He said that discussion of the peace process is one  of the goals of his visit to Lebanon.

Also present were members  of the Syrian delegation and top officials of the German  Economics Ministry, as well as the Syrian and German ambassadors  in Bonn and Damascus.    They looked into ways to deepen and expand cooperation and  friendship between Syria and Germany in various fields in the  best interests of the two countries. The German minister called  relations between Syria and Germany old and historic. Al-shar's  visit to Germany, he added, should help strengthen these ties.  He emphasized that Syria plays a significant role in the Middle  East. The German minister said his country was willing to help  Syria's economic development by upgrading bilateral cooperation.    For his part, al-Shar' reviewed Middle East political  developments. He pointed to the role Syria is playing under  President al-Asad in efforts to promote a just and comprehensive  peace predicated on UN resolutions and international legitimacy  so as to bring about security and stability -- the basic  requirements for economic and social development in Syria and  the region.    This morning, al-Shar' received Mr. (Hans Sherkin), head of  the foreign relations commitee at the German parliament.  Al-Shar's delegation was also present as were the Syrian and  German ambassadors in Bonn and Damascus. They reviewed Middle  East developments and bilateral ties.    Also this morning, al-Shar' held a news conference to mark  his official visit to Germany at which he took questions from  foreign, German, and Arab correspondents about his talks in  Germany.    Germany's Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel last night hosted a  dinner for al-Shar' and his delegation, also attended by German  officials and top bureaucrats of the German Foreign Ministry, as  well as the Syrian and German abmassadors in Bonn and Damascus.    Kinkel welcomed al-Shar' and told him he appreciated his  taking up the invitation to visit Bonn during these critical  circumstances in the Middle East. His speech noted the notable  developments in relations between Syria and Germany. Kinkel  stressed the need to hold further consultations and meetings to  compare notes on issues of shared interest. He reitrated  Syria's primary role in the region. The German minister called  for the peace process to be restarted, given the difficult  circmstances and impediments it is facing. The interests of  Syria and Germany, he said, stand to gain from a successful  peace process, since Middle Eastern and European peace,  security, and stability are interdependent. Kinkel stressed  that Germany and the European Union are determined to contribute  to the establishment of a just, comprehensive, and lasting peace  in the Middle East. He concluded his speech by saying that  Syria is an important player in the Middle East. We want to be  a dependable partner for Syria in Europe and the world, he added.    For his part, al-Shar' thanked Minister Kinkel for the  hospitality and the opportunity he has been given to see German  officials. Syria, al-Shar' added, is keen to deepen friendship  and cooperatioan with Germany in all areas. He emphasized that  his talks in Germany were good, constructive, and frank, and  showed the two countries have deep-rooted ties of friendship and  cooperation. Al-Shar' said Syria appreciated Germany's keenness  to bring peace to the Middle East. He emphasized that a united  Germany is bound to make an effective contribution to a just and  comprehensive peace in the Middle East. Al-Shar' said Syria is  serious and sincere in pursuing the peace process in line with  UN resolutions, the Madrid formula, and the land-for-peace  principle. He stressed that an Israeli withdrawal from the  occupied Arab territories is a must for the achievement of peace.     "

[Velayati] In the name of God, the compassionate, the  merciful [preceding phrase in Arabic]. The main problem is the  lack of mutual understanding, which has been available since the  very beginning of negotiations. But this problem needs time to  be solved. I mean, if we want to solve this problem we need  more time. If you take a look at the result of the talks that  they had in Moscow and also the preliminary statement that they  had in ceremonial session, you will see that may be there are  some progress. As I said in my interview, at the beginning they  were not ready to talk together. And both of them used to be  very angry against another one. Now the nature of their  presence is a positive step which has been taken by them. So we  can say that cautiously we are optimistic and we do hope that  after few days of talks they can reach some more positive  points. This is the national desire of the people of  Tajikistan. They want to put an end to these internal conflict  because they have lost many lives and they are facing, the  people of Tajikistan are facing a national disaster. They have  difficulties even for providing the raw material for their very  simple life. Lack of sanitation, lack of food, lack of  transportation, continuation of killing and slaughters and  assassination have made the people of Tajikistan frustrated.  People are very disappointed. That is the national desire that  now the time is ripe for a national reconciliation.    [Correspondent] It seems no specific plan for restoring  peace  in Tajikistan has been offered. Do you think a clear peace plan  will come under discussion in the current round of negotiations  in Tehran?    [Velayati] Of course, this is the task of the special envoy  of the secretary general of the United Nations. But as far as  we could understand of what he has said he has tried to make a  cease-fire at the beginning as a fist step; because the  establishment of the cease-fire will give opportunity to both  sides for continuation of talks and decreasing of tension; while  the continuation of assassination and killing and slaughters  will increase tension. And if tension is increased or is being  increased they cannot stop the hostility. So, the cease-fire is  the first step that should be established unconditionally,  without any precondition. That's what we could understand from  the special envoy of the secretary general of the United Nations.     "
0,FT934-12876 ,"FT934-12876 _AN-DJYCQABDFT 931025   FT  25 OCT 93 / Freedom near for Palestinians      By JULIAN OZANNE and REUTER      JERUSALEM, DAMASCUS   ISRAEL yesterday prepared to release a first batch of Palestinian prisoners in a gesture of goodwill towards the Palestine Liberation Organisation, but the move was overshadowed by the killing by Islamic fundamentalists of two Israeli soldiers in the occupied Gaza Strip. Mr Shimon Shetreet, economics minister, said yesterday's weekly cabinet meeting had agreed to start a gradual release of 760 prisoners over the coming days. Under an agreement negotiated between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation last week, the first batch will include the old, sick, women and children. The PLO, seeking to boost its support among Palestinians who remain sceptical of the self-government peace agreement, said the freed prisoners would include members of the Hamas fundamentalist group and would mark merely the beginning of the release of up to 14,000 Palestinians held in Israeli jails. The PLO said it would continue to press for the release of more prisoners at talks which resume in the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Taba tomorrow. The PLO is demanding the immediate release of all prisoners held for membership of a banned or 'hostile' organisation or imprisoned for minor activities such as demonstrating, rock throwing or hoisting of the Palestinian flag. Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, yesterday sought to reassure anxious Israelis about the release of prisoners, saying the PLO had kept its word to suspend violence against Israelis and attacks had been reduced by 50 per cent in the occupied territories since the peace agreement was signed last month. But continuing attacks by Hamas will anger Israeli public opinion and raise opposition to the release of Hamas activists. Mr Eliahu Ben-Elissar, a right-wing opposition member of parliament, yesterday criticised the release programme and said Israel was rushing to free 'terrorists' without demanding anything in return. British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said after talks with President Hafez al-Assad that Syria was not hardening its line on Middle East peace and Damascus wanted a peace pact with Israel, Reuter reports from Damascus. 'I am impressed by the seriousness here and I am sure that Israel is serious, it is a matter of finding the right time for them to come together again and have the right flexibility on both sides once they come together to reach an agreement.'

HEADQUARTERS  BEFORE THE MANAGUA GOVERNMENT PRESENTED ITS LATEST PLAN TO END THE WAR.      By DAVID G. SAVAGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER      UNITED NATIONS      A grim-faced, five-member delegation of the reconstituted Contra leadership sat  down here Thursday for new peace talks with Nicaragua's government, with the  Sandinistas pushing hard for an agreement on a partial demobilization of the  resistance movement.    The two days of talks at U.N. headquarters here are intended to find a way to  stop the new fighting between the Sandinistas and the U.S.-backed rebels. But  before the negotiations got under way Thursday afternoon, it was the Sandinista  leaders who were doing most of the talking. The government formally presented a  detailed 15-point peace plan, which included everything from a Sandinista  pledge to stop accepting arms shipments to a schedule of daily rations for  repatriated Contras for beans, rice, milk, cooking oil, canned beef and sugar.    The government proposal is ""not an ultimatum,"" but rather a ""generous offer"" to  end the fighting and repatriate the resistance fighters, said Nicaraguan  Foreign Minister Miguel D'Escoto. But he stressed that the government's  proposal requires that the Contra delegates agree to demobilize at least half  of their remaining forces.    ""We will not continue to declare a unilateral cease-fire,"" he added, ""as long  as that means we cease and they fire.""    A diplomatic source in Managua, the Nicaraguan capital, said that Sandinista  officials disclosed the basic elements of their proposal in a written message  to the U.S. Embassy in Managua on Tuesday, a day before President Daniel Ortega  announced it publicly. The message included an implied warning to the Bush  Administration that Nicaragua is ready to attack Contra positions in Honduras  if the proposal is rejected.    The message, handed to an Embassy official by Defense Minister Humberto Ortega,  also acknowledged that Nicaragua received a shipload of weapons last Friday.  The unusual admission was coupled with the offer to suspend arms imports if the  Contras accept a timetable for demobilizing.    ""In such circumstances,"" the message added, ""the Nicaraguan government will not  carry out any kind of military operations against bases that the  counterrevolutionary forces have along the (Honduran) border with Nicaragua.""    The Sandinistas have crossed into Honduras several times during the eight-year  war to attack the Contras, whose command post at Yamales is within a few miles  of the border. The last such incursion -- in March, 1988 -- succeeded in  driving hundreds of rebels out of northern Nicaragua but failed to capture the  command post. The heavy fighting was followed by peace talks that established a  cease-fire, which endured until last week.    The Contra delegation, which arrived in New York on Thursday without having  seen the latest Sandinista proposal, had little to say before the meeting. In a  brief comment to reporters, delegation leader Col. Enrique Bermudez said only  that the proposal as outlined Wednesday by Ortega appeared to be ""a propaganda  ploy"" that ""amounts to a surrender."" Other Contra officials and the Bush  Administration also scoffed at Ortega's offer to halt arms shipments until  April 25, since they believe the Sandinistas already have a more than ample  stockpile of weapons.    Ortega said Wednesday that the agreement signed in August by the five Central  American presidents in Tela, Honduras, requires that the Contras begin  demobilizing by Dec. 5. Instead, Ortega said, the Contras have continued to  infiltrate into Nicaragua from Honduras and to attack peasants.    The Contras for their part have refused to demobilize until they see that the  free elections set for Feb. 25 are held as planned.    Earlier Thursday in Miami, the Contras announced formation of a new  ""civilian-military commission"" to replace the old directorate, several of whose  members have resigned and returned to Nicaragua, the Associated Press reported.    Contra military spokesman Alejandro Acevedo said the U.N. negotiating team led  by Contra military commander Bermudez had recognized the new commission, which  includes only one of the former directors, Aristides Sanchez. Ousted civilian  Contra leaders compared the action to a coup, the AP said.    U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar opened the talks here by urging  each side ""to show the necessary flexibility,"" but he also appeared to nudge  the Contras toward a commitment to demobilize. He pointed out that the Tela  accords set an actual deadline for a Contra demobilization. ""The deadline  established in the Tela accords is getting closer,"" the secretary general said.

0,FT933-5957 ,"FT933-5957 _AN-DIAB3AA3FT 930901   FT  01 SEP 93 / The Middle East: Hussein and Assad hide their misgivings      By MARK NICHOLSON      CAIRO   KING HUSSEIN of Jordan yesterday flew unexpectedly to Damascus for urgent talks with President Hafez al-Assad, the Syrian leader, in the hope of co-ordinating the two countries' response to the proposed Palestinian deal with Israel - which took both leaders by surprise. Neither Jordan nor Syria has yet ventured any formal reaction to the deal apart, as one diplomat put it, for 'King Hussein's eloquent departure to Damascus'. After yesterday's talks, a spokesman for President Assad would say only that the leaders had been 'surprised' by the PLO-Israeli agreement, and that there had been 'no co-ordination between the Arab parties'. However, politicians and diplomats in Amman said that both leaders had been displeased by the absence of consultation before the agreement, and that King Hussein in particular feared that Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestinian Liberation Organisation, had conceded too much to Israel too soon. In Egypt, Mr Arafat denied there were any misgivings in Amman or Damascus and said before talks yesterday with President Hosni Mubarak, the Egyptian leader, that it was 'completely incorrect that they (Syria and Jordan) are not happy with the accord'. But senior Jordanian officials said that the king first heard of the deal over the telephone and was angered that Mr Arafat should have reached in secret an agreement which bears directly on Jordan's national interests. 'If governments are not aware of what neighbours are doing, they are not going to be happy,' said one prominent Jordanian. 'The lack of co-ordination has left everyone with questions to ask, and answers to expect.' Both Jordan and Syria are understood to feel that the separate Palestinian agreement will place both countries under greater pressure from Israel to conclude their own bilateral peace agreements with Tel Aviv, while compromising elements of their bargaining positions. King Hussein is also understood to be concerned that the agreement has failed to win sufficient Israeli concessions on the questions of Israeli settlements in the occupied territories and on the status of Jerusalem - a city with deep significance to the king's Hashemite monarchy. Diplomats said King Hussein's talks in Damascus will have been aimed at cementing a united response with Syria to the agreement. Both countries have maintained they would not conclude separate peace deals with Israel without the Palestinians having first won a satisfactory agreement of their own. The king will now be anxious Jordan does not become exposed by any immediate Syrian move to advance its own track of the Arab-Israeli negotiations on the back of the PLO-Israeli deal. Diplomats said neither country was likely to hurry declarations of principles towards a full peace with Israel - the next stage in each country's negotiations - without first fully digesting the detail of the new agreement. King Hussein in particular will also be anxious to gauge the degree of opposition to the deal both within Jordan's majority Palestinian population and in Jordan's teeming Palestinian camps. However, Syrian negotiators in Washington said that progress in the Palestinian talks with Israel would prompt progress in the Syrian-Israeli track of the negotiations. Mr Itamar Rabinovich, Israel's chief negotiator, also said he believed Syria and Israel would agree on a declaration of principles 'during this round or next' of the talks.

The PLO and Israel agreed on Monday that negotiations over the implementation of the September 13 declaration of principles were in crisis following the fruitless meeting between Mr Arafat and Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, in Cairo at the weekend. The two sides had set a target of December 13 for the start of Israeli troop withdrawals from the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho. But the talks have foundered over the control of border crossings, the size of the territory to be administered by the Palestinians around Jericho, and the Israeli troop presence required to protect Jewish settlers in Gaza. The two leaders have agreed to meet again before the end of next week and Mr Arafat repeated yesterday that he was still hopeful an agreement could be reached. The failure of Israel to begin the troop withdrawal as scheduled has sparked bitterness among Palestinians in the occupied territories, where violence again flared yesterday with two Arabs shot dead in Gaza and another 12 wounded during clashes with Israeli forces. Mr Douglas Hurd, British foreign secretary, yesterday urged Mr Arafat to be firm in opposition to violence and to reassure Israelis the risk they had taken for peace was reciprocated. He also urged the PLO to persuade Arab countries to relax the trade boycott against Israel and to build up bilateral contacts as soon as possible. Before leaving Strasbourg for London yesterday, Mr Arafat said that the entire credibility of the peace process would be a stake if Israel failed to honour the April 13 deadline for completing its military withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho. The PLO leader was responding to a statement from Mr Rabin in which the Israeli leader stressed there was nothing sacred about any of the dates set out in the declaration of principles signed in Washington. If Mr Rabin said that, 'there is doubt for the credibility of the peace process,' added Mr Arafat. The PLO leader is due today to hold talks with Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, before leaving for Dublin. Meanwhile the remaining 215 Palestinian deportees from the 415 who were expelled a year ago from the occupied territories to southern Lebanon, were informed by Israel that they could return home today.

The talks dealt with the latest developments in  the Arab arena and the developments in the Middle East peace  process.    Afterward, the Russian official stated that he and the Arab  League secretary general discussed the peace process and the  direct practical steps that must be taken to advance the peace  process. They also discussed the situation in Iraq and the  Libyan-Western crisis.    Pasuvalyuk said that Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid welcomed an increase  in the Russian role in the area, considering that Russia is a  big power, a permanent member of the UN Security Council, a  cosponsor of the peace process, and has interests and friends in  the Middle East.    The Russian envoy said that Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid explained that  the Russian role in the Middle East need not necessarily repeat  or compete with the role of any other party. But it should be a  constructive role working for the benefit of peace and stability  in the region.    The Russian official affirmed that his country wants to  confer with all the parties concerned to achieve stability in  the Middle East. He also affirmed that Russia wants to resume  the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations.    He said that Moscow has made enormous efforts to convince  all  the parties of the need to resume the peace process despite the  difficulties facing it after the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre in  Hebron.

In a scarcely disguised rebuke, Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, said he had been 'surprised' by comments made in a newspaper interview by Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister. Speaking after a meeting of the Anglo-Irish conference, Sir Patrick said Mr Spring had apparently gone beyond the 'cardinal principle' that the constitutional future of Northern Ireland would have to be agreed across the two communities in the province. But Mr Spring said that it would be wrong for any option for Northern Ireland to be ruled out: 'If we are not allowed to put forward provocative ideas then we may as well all give up.' He added that if 'round-table' talks on the province's future failed, then 'ultimately responsibility lies with governments and I think that the governments have to make that quite clear'. The row reflected growing frustration in London and Dublin at the failure of the two governments to restart the talks involving Northern Ireland's main political leaders that collapsed last November. Unionists say that they will not re-enter until the Irish Republic modifies its constitutional claim on the north. Sir Patrick again refused to give up yesterday, saying: 'I don't visualise this process failing and I'm certainly not planning for it failing or a course of action if it does.' However, Mr Spring has raised the possibility of the two governments going over the heads of local politicians and agreeing a new political framework for the province, possibility being put to referenda in north and south Ireland. Options could include joint authority or sovereignty of the province. But Mr John Major, the prime minister, and Sir Patrick have firmly rejected such proposals and yesterday Mr James Molyneaux, leader of the Ulster Unionist party, said Mr Spring's comments amounted to an 'incitement to take the paramilitary road'. Sir Patrick and Mr Spring also clashed over the exclusion order served on Mr John Matthews, who was cleared in court of an attempted bomb attack on Downing Street. In spite of attempts by Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, to defend the order, Mr Spring said he believed Britain should review the powers it has under the 1974 Prevention of Terrorism Act.

0,FT944-73 ,"FT944-73 _AN-FAAACAC4FT 941231   FT  31 DEC 94 / On The Front Line: Rabin the soldier - War and Peace (Warmongers and Peacemakers)      By ROGER MATTHEWS   Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, may have been awarded a one-third stake in this year's Nobel peace prize, but it is still to men in uniform he instinctively turns for advice. The long-time soldier measures every proposed step towards peace against the potential risk to Israeli security. It has been Shimon Peres, the foreign minister and fellow Nobel peace prize winner, who over the past two years has provided most of the vision, while Rabin has made the daily calculation about levels of violence and their impact on the electorate. Nothing better summed up Rabin's approach to peace with the Palestinians than his initial reluctance to attend the White House signing ceremony in 1993, and his obvious distaste at having to shake the hand of Yassir Arafat. But it was the price which had to be paid for getting Israeli troops out of the Gaza strip. A year earlier Rabin had remarked that he wished Gaza 'would sink into the sea', a comment which he claimed had originally been made by David Ben-Gurion, Israel's first prime minister. But, Rabin added, as Gaza was unlikely to drop into the sea, it had to be dealt with. One attraction of the 'Gaza first' option was that it did not require Rabin to make many tough decisions on more contentious issues such as the future of Jewish settlements in the occupied territories. The settlements remained in Gaza under Israeli military protection. The arrangements for the far more numerous and highly populated settlements in the West Bank were to be the subject of future negotiations, while the opening of talks on their long-term status was at least two years away. Although not explicitly stated, the chances of those talks proving fruitful rested to a large extent on Arafat doing what Israeli governments had for so long failed to achieve and bring a halt to attacks on Israelis by Palestinian radicals, and especially by Hamas, the extremist Islamic group. Predictably, Arafat and his inexperienced police force have not succeeded. Worse, the failure of the peace process to bring visible economic benefits to the impoverished Gaza strip is tilting the political balance away from Arafat and towards his opponents. The Palestinian leader needs help, and the man best placed to provide it is Rabin. But he is already balking at undertaking the next stage of the peace process: the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the main Arab population centres in the West Bank to allow elections to be held. Rabin now says he does not see how this can be done while ensuring the safety of Israeli settlers, a comment which brought howls of protest from Palestinian negotiators. Rabin is also moving with caution in his contacts with Syria, insisting that President Hafez al-Assad commits himself to a timetable for establishing full relations before Israel announces how much of the Golan Heights it is willing to withdraw from, and when. Even if US mediation produces an improbable breakthrough, Rabin has promised Israeli voters the final say in a referendum. In spite of the loss of momentum and the stand-off with Syria, Rabin will have been satisfied with his year, if only for the peace treaty signed with Jordan, an achievement that won almost universal acclaim in Israel. His place in history is assured, but whether it will be primarily as a man of peace has yet to be decided.   Countries:-  ILZ  Israel, Middle East.   Industries:-  P9111 Executive Offices.

Mr Al Gore, the vice-president, informed Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, in a telephone call that the US was lifting its ban on official contacts with Sinn Fein representatives. A senior administration official said this was 'the beginning of a relationship with Sinn Fein, a party with whom we've had no official contacts for 25 years'. Mr Gore's telephone call appeared designed to raise contacts with Mr Adams to the highest level possible without offending the British government by a meeting at the White House. Although Mr Adams has been pressing for a more conspicuous meeting with President Bill Clinton or Mr Gore, officials said he had not made any formal request for such a meeting. Downing Street's response to the telephone call was low key, with officials emphasising that 'the Americans have got to decide for themselves' how they receive Mr Adams. But moderate unionists complained that the move was improper and premature. 'They would have been wiser to wait until Sinn Fein became a normal political party,' said Rev Martin Smyth, the Ulster Unionist MP for South Belfast. Yesterday's move came as Mr Adams prepared for a high-profile television debate with Mr Ken Maginnis, the Ulster Unionist security spokesman. The British government is analysing with great care remarks made by the Sinn Fein president during his second visit to the US this year. London has promised to begin dialogue on how to admit Sinn Fein to political talks on Northern Ireland's future within three months of a permanent end to IRA violence It is still not convinced that the month-old ceasefire is for good. But senior officials said yesterday that every day which passed 'without violence, without killing' gave grounds for optimism. A first meeting will take place today at the State Department between Mr Adams and Mr John Kornblum, deputy assistant secretary of state for European affairs. Mr Kornblum will be joined by Mr Leon Fuerth, national security adviser to Mr Gore. In a letter to Mr Adams confirming today's meeting, Mr Anthony Lake, Mr Clinton's principal national security adviser, said the Sinn Fein leader's 'role in bringing about the IRA ceasefire was a courageous step forward for peace'.

Since August, 1987, four landmark agreements among the region's presidents have  diverted much of the U.S.-backed Contra war against Nicaragua's Sandinista  rulers into a broadly contested political campaign that is to culminate in  national elections next Feb. 25.    The latest regional accord -- among Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala,  Honduras and Nicaragua -- also led to two rounds of peace talks, in September  and October, between El Salvador's new rightist government and the Farabundo  Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN).    Suddenly, both wars have escalated. Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega,  accusing the Bush Administration of ordering stepped-up Contra raids to disrupt  the elections, ended a 19-month cease-fire Nov. 1. In turn, El Salvador's  U.S.-backed government has charged Ortega with arming the FMLN for a major  guerrilla offensive that began here Nov. 11.    President Alfredo Cristiani's announcement Sunday of a diplomatic break with  Managua marks the most serious conflict between any of the five nations that  have worked so closely to find a common formula for settling internal guerrilla  conflicts.    ""Today, the level of war and the level of political tension in the region is  greater than at any other moment of this process,"" Francisco Rojas Aravena, a  Costa Rican political analyst, said Sunday. ""It will be very difficult to  reactivate any kind of peace initiative for many months.""    Among the likely casualties of the renewed conflict is the scheduled fifth  Central American summit, which had been set to take place in Nicaragua early  next month.    Cristiani said he would not go to Nicaragua but would ask instead that the  leaders of the three other countries meet him elsewhere and condemn Ortega.  Costa Rican officials immediately rejected that idea, apparently scuttling  hopes for any meeting.    ""I don't think isolating Nicaragua helps any peaceful purpose,"" said John  Biehl, an adviser to Costa Rican President Oscar Arias Sanchez. ""If Cristiani  has proof of Nicaraguan involvement, he should present it to the others. If  what happened is real, it's very serious, and Ortega will have a lot of  explaining to do.""    Arias won the 1987 Nobel Peace Prize for drafting the plan on which the  original accord was based. Among its principles is that no country is to aid  insurgents trying to overthrow the government of another and that rebels will  lay down their arms in return for amnesty and a fair chance to compete in  democratic elections.    Though poles apart in ideology, Ortega and Cristiani share a stake in the peace  process because it favors established governments.    Ortega, while resuming the military offensive against the Contras, has held  nine rounds of talks with their leaders this month trying to find terms for the  rebel army's disbandment. The talks reached an impasse last Tuesday.    As a result, Ortega was looking forward to the December meeting to demand  compliance with the previous summit accord to shut down Contra camps in  Honduras by Dec. 5.    Some diplomats in the region believe Nicaragua has indeed shipped arms to the  FMLN, in part as a bargaining chip to force some action to disband the Contras.  If that is the case, Cristiani could have gained by confronting Ortega at the  summit.    ""Cristiani needs these forums to help him delegitimize the FMLN,"" said a  Guatemalan political analyst. ""The fact that he is giving up that option shows  how weak he is against the hard-liners in his own military.""    The United States has built up the Salvadoran and Honduran armed forces to halt  what it calls the threat of subversion by the Sandinistas, who took power in  their own guerrilla uprising in 1979 and maintain close ties with the FMLN. The  Reagan Administration used Costa Rican and Salvadoran territory, as well as  Honduras, as staging areas for Contra operations.    Despite the resulting regional friction -- including Nicaraguan and Honduran  military raids into each other's territory -- the five countries managed to  maintain diplomatic ties with each other -- until Sunday.    Even before Cristiani's decision, Costa Rican officials had expressed doubt  that a December meeting could be held. Arias was angered when Ortega spoiled  his Pan American summit in Costa Rica last month by announcing the end of the  Nicaraguan cease-fire. And he felt betrayed by both the government and  guerrillas in El Salvador for escalating their fighting just three weeks after  holding peace talks under his auspices.    ""The whole peace plan is on the threshold of being blown to pieces,"" Guillermo  Solis, a Costa Rican Foreign Ministry official, said last week.    Central American officials now believe that a summit must wait at least until  after new governments being elected in Honduras, Costa Rica and Nicaragua take  office between January and May.

In 75 minutes of talks in Downing Street -- the first since  they signed their historic Ulster peace declaration two months  ago -- they took stock of developments on their joint initiative  to end the spiral of violence.    Hours before their discussions began they were given a grim  reminder of the continuing terrorism.    A series of firebomb attacks in seven London stores bore all  the hallmarks of the Provisonal IRA, said Scotland Yard.    As they left Downing Street, Mr Major and Mr Reynolds united  in condemning the incidents and recent terrorist attacks in  Northern Ireland    Mr Major said: ""Our response to that is entirely identical.  There is absolutely no justification for those firebombs  overnight any more than there is justification for the killing  of a community police officer in Belfast last week or the other  atrocities that have taken place in Northern Ireland.""    The prime ministers agreed to initiate a new round of  negotiations on the future of Northern Ireland with or without a  response from the IRA and their Sinn Fein allies to the December  15 peace declaration.    Mr Reynolds said officials from the two governments would  agree later today on a date for a meeting of their liaison  committee to advance the next stage of the talks process.    Mr Major insisted: ""There is a route now open for Sinn Fein  to join the constitutional process -- they know what they have  to do. All they have to do is give up violence and then they  will have a proper route to express their views  constitutionally.""    Mr Reynolds again stressed his view that the road to peace  was going to be a long one and that there would be difficulties  along the way.    ""We knew there would always be people on both sides on the  paramilitaries who would be trying to stop our best efforts.    ""But regardless of this violence and destruction that takes  place we will continue along that difficult road, recognising  that people will be trying to frustrate our efforts but that  they will not succeed.""    Today's meeting went ahead before the two prime ministers  join the crowd at Twickenham for the Ireland-England rugby  international. Mr Major referred to the match as he and Mr  Reynolds began a brief news conference outside 10 Downing Street  by saying he had brought along his second row.    ""We are wholly united in our approach to try to find a  solution to the problems of Northern Ireland,"" he added.    ""We regard our joint declaration as a foundation stone for  the future approach of the two governments. We are committed to  it and its lasting value. We see it as a balanced statement of  lasting principles, and it is our view that its value has  already been clearly shown in the way it has been received both  in Ireland and internationally.""    Mr Major said it was impossible for either he or Mr Reynolds  to say whether the IRA would give up its campaign of violence in  the near future.    ""What we are utterly agreed about is that there is no  justification for the continuation of violence by the  Provisionals or by anybody else. What must be fully understood  is that we are not waiting for the Provisionals or anybody else.    ""We have taken further steps in the talks process and we  have  this morning reaffirmed our joint commitment to that process.  No one should be able to veto progress on the talks. We have  made clear what Sinn Fein needs to do to join the process.    ""They are free to come in or they are free to stay out -- if  that is what they choose. But what they can't do is hold up our  determination to continue with the talks process and endeavour  to find a solution.""    The two premiers agreed to maintain the current high level  of  cooperation on security and do all they could to oppose  terrorism.    Mr Major said he believed improved security cooperation was  of immense help in recent years, and that was going to continue.    ""The intention that we both have is peace. We'd like it soon  but however long it takes our determination is to continue a  search for that peace.""     "

Delegates at the exploratory Somali peace talks in the Ethiopian capital said the 57-year-old general, who has been blocking agreement between 15 factions since Monday, had finally agreed to three out of a five point proposal. The points accepted include an immediate nationwide cease fire and the convening of a national political reconciliation conference either in Mogadishu or Addis Ababa in late April. Yet to be agreed are a list of participants to the conference and an agenda. The breakthrough came after US Marines, backed by M1-A1 tanks and Cobra helicopter gun ships, blasted two compounds housing gunmen loyal to Gen Aideed and captured an arsenal of tanks, armoured personnel carriers, battle wagons and heavy artillery pieces. Delegates said both the US military action in Mogadishu and an eleventh hour intervention by Mr Meles Zenawi, the Ethiopian President, had persuaded Gen Aideed that if he did not join the growing consensus at the exploratory peace conference he would be completely isolated. But they warned that Gen Aideed could easily reverse his position. 'He has agreed tonight because of the pressure he is under,' said Mr Mohamed Farrar Siad, a member of self styled interim President Ali Mahdi's delegation. 'But the problem remains that Aideed wants the presidency and everything decided here could affect that ambition. He could change his face tomorrow ..we are in dialogue with an abnormal person.' Yesterday's dawn assault in northwest Mogadishu, which saw a 20 minute exchange of fire, was the most biggest military strike by US forces since they landed in Somalia last month and marks a new 'get tough' approach to Somalia's armed factions. There were no figures available last night for the number of casualties on the Somali side, but one Marine was wounded. Hours before the last minute agreement delegates from other factions could hardly hide their joy at the way the general's wings had been clipped by US forces. 'Good,' said Mr Ali Mahdi, Somalia's self-styled interim president and Gen Aideed's arch rival. 'It's very nice.' The warlords and political leaders are expected to sign a commitment today to hold a reconciliation conference but it is possible agreement may take several more days.

Sources close to the paramilitaries said Sunday night's bomb attack by the Ulster Volunteer Force on a Sinn Fein office in Belfast was a 'warning shot' aimed at underlining their resolve to defend Protestant interests. 'The situation is still being analysed but the message for now is unchanged from what it was after last week's IRA ceasefire. We are not going to dance to the IRA's tune,' said one source. The view was confirmed yesterday by a Presbyterian minister who has acted as intermediary for the paramilitaries. The Rev Roy Magee said: 'The loyalist paramilitaries are saying, 'We are still here and as far as we are concerned the war goes on'.' While the IRA's ceasefire appears to be holding, loyalist paramilitaries believe they have the capacity to exploit uncertainties and anxieties within unionist communities. Community workers meeting in the Shankill Road yesterday backed an end to all terrorist violence, while expressing fears about Sinn Fein's call for a campaign of civil protest by the Catholic community. To some Protestants the campaign - which has already led to the illegal reopening of cross-border roads by demonstrators - has resurrected memories of the campaign of Catholic civil disobedience in the early stages of the troubles. Mr Alfred McClory, who runs a community centre in the Shankill and liaises with loyalist prisoners, said yesterday: 'We are living from one day to the next. Peace is here today but it could just as well be gone tomorrow.' He said many working class Protestants wanted to see what reassurances, if any, the Rev Ian Paisley gets from his planned meeting in Downing Street with Mr John Major today. In the Shankill, as in other Protestant strongholds, the fear remains that the IRA and Sinn Fein, together with Dublin, are moving the peace process inexorably towards Irish unity. Mr Jim Rogers, an Ulster Unionist party councillor in Belfast, said: 'We want to see no change in Northern Ireland's constitutional position as part of the United Kingdom.' He added that while he did not condone violence, he could understand the logic behind the continuing existence of loyalist paramilitaries. 'Some of our people are saying they will need the actions of paramilitaries before the battle for real peace is won,' he said. Mr Rogers conceded that loyalist paramilitaries risked becoming isolated from their communities if they launched a full-scale military offensive. 'If they do that the loyalists will increasingly look like the baddies in the film and the IRA the goodies.' Such an assessment is understood to be shared by some members of the UVF and the Ulster Freedom Fighters, the two main paramilitary organisations.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

The press bureau of the presidential office announced that  Mitterrand made the suggestion in a telephone conversation with  U.S. President Bill Clinton.    Earlier this month, Mitterrand had respectively wrote to  Clinton, Russian President Boris Yeltsin, executive president of  the European Union, Greek Prime Minister Andreas George  Papandreou and UN Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali.    In the letters, Mitterrand asked the four sides to  coordinate  their positions and urge the warring parties in  Bosnia-Herzegovina to resume peace talks immediately in a bid to  seek a political solution to the crisis.    On April 18, Mitterrand also had telephone talks with German  Chancellor Helmut Kohl. French official sources said Kohl  agreed to such a quadripartite emergency meeting while Yeltsin  also gave his consent in a telephone conversation with Kohl.    In a related development, a spokesman of the French Foreign  Ministry said today that French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe had  telephone talks with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher  Tuesday afternoon and reiterated the following French position  on an end to the Bosnia conflict:    -- Adoption of a UN resolution on an immediate cease-fire  in,  the withdrawal of the Serb troops from and the deployment of UN  peacekeepers in Gorazde.    -- Effective measures to protect the security zones  designated by the United Nations in Bosnia-Hercegovina.    -- A united position among Russia, Western Europe, the  United  States and the United Nations for pressing the warring parties  in Bosnia-Herzegovina to resume peace talks.    ""The U.S. secretary of state agreed in principle that it is  necessary to further coordinate the diplomatic actions of all  parties,"" but he failed to take a clear-cut stand on the French  proposal, the spokesman said.

On the evening of 10 April and  the afternoon of 11 April, as demanded by Yasushi Akashi, UN  special envoy to former Yugoslavia, U.S. fighter planes carried  out air strikes against Serbian military positions around  Gorazde in Bosnia-Herzegovina. These were the first NATO air  strikes against Serbian ground military targets since the  outbreak of the war in Bosnia- Herzegovina two years ago, and  they were important NATO military operations.    Gorazde was one of the six Muslim ""protection zones""  declared  by the UN Security Council last year. The UN peace-keeping  force maintains that it has the right to protect these zones so  that ""they will not come under armed attack by any side."" This  time NATO carried out air strikes against Serbian positions on  these grounds.    After the air strikes, the Bosnian Serbs accused the UN  peacekeeping force of ""opposing the Serbs,"" announced the  suspension of all their contacts with the UN peacekeepers, and  canceled their prescheduled meeting with the U.S. special  envoys. People fear that this NATO move will affect the UN  peacekeeping force's neutral position in the Bosnian war and  produce an unfavorable impact on the UN role in mediating the  Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis.    Russian President Yeltsin has criticized the United States,  saying that it had no right to unilaterally decide on the air  strikes and that this should have been submitted to the Security  Council for discussion. U.S. President Clinton has said that  U.S. planes would carry out air strikes again if necessary. The  dissensions between the United States and Russia on the Bosnia-  Herzegovina issue have worsened further. People have noted  that, over the last two months, due to Russian mediation, NATO  delayed the plan on bombing Sarajevo, and the Serbs opened the  Tuzla airport. So Russia's right to speak on the  Bosnia-Herzegovina issue had grown markedly stronger.  Evidently, NATO's current air strikes possibly have more  political than military significance. These air strikes seemed  to send out a dual signal: One is that ""bombardment"" will be  used to bring about talks and force the Serbs to make  concessions on the territorial issue; the other suggests to  Russia that the United States and NATO are keeping the  initiative in the Bosnian situation.    After the outbreak of the Sarajevo crisis in February, a new  trend appeared in the peace talks on the Bosnian issue and some  hope for peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina glimmered in people's  minds. In this situation, NATO's current ""bombardment"" is  unlikely to bring about peace; instead, they will possibly  affect the peace process. In addition, various foreign powers  are coming onto the stage from behind the scenes on the  Bosnia-Herzegovina issue. On the one hand, this will help  encourage the conflicting parties to participate in the peace  talks; on the other, as their dissensions and contradictions  become apparent, Bosnia-Herzegovina's peace process may become  more complicated.

The four Arab delegations yesterday agreed to an Israeli proposal for a 10-day recess so that the teams could return home for consultations. When the sixth round of talks opened on August 24 it had been intended they would continue without interruption for a month. Mr Bush has been in contact with King Hussein of Jordan, who is in the US recovering from surgery, while Mr Eagleburger is seeing the heads of delegations. All sides have been pleased by the improvement in the atmosphere at the talks following the election of a new government in Israel, but there has been little if any progress on issues of substance. There is concern among the Arab delegates at what they see as the lack of involvement by the US administration. Earlier this week the Palestinian delegation said its talks with Israel were at an impasse. Jordan complained that the Israelis had reneged on items that should appear on a joint agenda, while the Syrians said they had not yet seen an Israeli willingness to discuss 'land for peace'. Israeli spokesmen have generally been more enthusiastic, especially about the talks with Syria. Mr Yassir Arafat, the chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, meanwhile has again shown his disregard for American public opinion, following his support for Iraq during the Gulf war. He has appeared at the Non-Aligned Movement summit in Jakarta hand-in-hand with Mr Taha Yassin Ramadan, one of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's closest colleagues. Jordan yesterday hailed a message from King Fahd, the Saudi Arabian ruler, to King Hussein as signalling a breakthrough in the countries' frosty post-Gulf war relations. Mr Mahmoud al-Sharif, Jordan's acting foreign minister, said the message had 'created an opening in the otherwise frigid relations in the two countries'.  The Financial Times   London Page 6  "

Al-Shar' conveyed President Hafiz al-Asad's greetings to the  German president, who asked him to convey to the president his  best wishes and warmest condolences on the death of Staff Major  Basil al-Asad.    Talks dealt with regional developments and the peace  process.  In this regard, the German president emphasized Syria's  important regional role under the leadership of President Hafiz  al-Asad. He reiterated Germany's condemnation of the Hebron  massacre and hoped that this crime, which was condemned  worldwide, would not affect the peace process in the region.    Earlier this morning, the Syrian side led by Faruq al-Shar'  and the German side led by Klaus Kinkel held a session of  official talks at the German Foreign Ministry in Bonn. [passage  omitted]    The two sides exchanged views on ways to bolster and develop  bilateral relations in various areas and in a manner that serves  the interests of the two countries and peoples and contributes  to peace and stability in the region. The two ministers  reviewed relations between Syria and the European Union and  stressed the importance of developing cooperation between them  on all levels. Talks centered on the situation in the region,  particularly the developments of the peace process and its  future prospects. In this regard, Kinkel stressed Syria's  important role in achieving a just, comprehensive, and lasting  peace in the region. [passage omitted]    Speaking to reporters in Bonn today, Faruq al-Shar' said:  For peace to be comprehensive and achieve security and  stability in the region, the well-known peace requirements  should be met. These are full withdrawal from the occupied Arab  territories and implementation of Resolutions 242 and 338, and  425 on Lebanon. Otherwise, talk about peace will be mere talk  that will not produce concrete results. On the contrary, using  hollow phrases about peace without real results will lead to new  acts of violence and terrorism similar to the massacre at the  holy Ibrahimi Mosque.     "

Stressing the role Paris and the Community could play in the multilateral negotiations on regional co-operation, he said the EC should levy up to Ecu1bn from its economic development fund for joint projects in areas such as water, tourism, transport and trade. It would also encourage 'useful forms of dialogue' between Arabs and Israel, Mr Mitterrand said. 'This is an initiative which France very much wishes to pass on to the European Council.' The president was speaking after talks with Yitzhak Rabin, prime minister. He and Mr Roland Dumas, his foreign minister, also met Mr Faisal Husseini, the senior Palestinian leader in the occupied territories, and members of the Palestinian delegation to the Middle East negotiations. He travels on to Jordan today for talks with King Hussein. He described Israel's approach to the peace talks, which have progressed only slowly since they began a year ago, as 'very positive' and expressed support for the process despite reservations about exclusion of the Palestine Liberation Organisation. Mr Rabin said he had asked France to urge the Palestinians to shed their objections and press ahead with the negotiations. But both Mr Mitterrand and Mr Rabin played down suggestions that the president was acting as an intermediary in the bilateral talks. French and Israeli officials signed four bilateral co-operation agreements, including an accord on joint scientific research and an outline for an electric railway project.

The newspapers quoted spokesmen of the Alex Boncayo Brigade  (ABB), the urban assassination squad of the insurgent New  People's Army (NPA), that they would target representatives of  these three groups unless President Fidel Ramos reversed a 22  percent increase in the prices of fuel products.    The formerly-dormant ABB, which killed over 200 soldiers,  policemen and civilians in Manila from 1987-90, earlier claimed  responsibility for the bombing of the offices of three oil  companies in this city on Tuesday. The ABB said the bombings  were intended to protest the oil price hike imposed last Friday.  The ABB added that if the government agreed to reverse the oil  price hike, they in return would agree to open peace talks with  the government.    The Communist Party of the Philippines, the political  leadership of the NPA, is already considering peace negotiations  with the Ramos government, but talks have been stalled by  numerous conditions imposed by the insurgents.    Meanwhile, an anti-Ramos newspaper, in an editorial  published  Thursday, called on the assassins to target local officials and  not foreigners. The Today, a broadsheet which began publishing  just last month, in reaction to the ABB's threat said: ""Do we  have to remind the ABB that native insurgencies are supposed to  kill native officials, not foreign civilians or diplomatic  personnel?"" The newspaper said that attacking foreigners would  only scare away foreign investment and would only give the Ramos  government justification to crack down on civil liberties, ""so  it can steal in peace and stay in power.""    The newspaper also said that the ABB ""doesn't have the  discrimination and the balls to tackle its proper enemy -- the  government and its officials."" ""What a pity. Yet another golden  opportunity to prove the ABB's usefulness thrown out the  window,"" the editorial concluded.     "

We exchanged views, we briefed each other  on the latest developments and the ongoing effort by the  cochairmen [of the Geneva conference on the former Yugoslavia]  and the Greek Presidency of the European Union. You know things  are difficult. We are trying to do something better than has  been done. We always hope. We hope the Geneva talks will be  positive. The Greek Presidency will make every effort to  achieve a positive outcome in Geneva, doing as much as it can to  influence things with the interested parties. You also know  that today we begin what is the first chapter in the efforts of  the Greek Presidency toward achieving an immediate cease-fire in  Bosnia-Herzegovina and promoting the Franco-German plan we have  accepted in the European Union, enforced as I said with the  thoughts and views of the Greek Presidency, especially as Greece  is a Balkan country. Thank you very much, now I turn the podium  over to Lord Owen.    [Owen, in English followed by Greek translation at the end  of  his remarks] Mr. Foreign Minister, first of all, Mr. Stoltenberg  and I thank you very much indeed for your hospitality. As you  say, the meeting will continue but it is very important at this  early stage in the Greek Presidency that both of us should  exchange views with you. As you say, as a Balkan state, you  contribute to the European Union from the depth of knowledge and  of your proximity to this tragic situation. There is no doubt  that the neighbors to the former Yugoslavia are paying a very  heavy price, not just financially but in many other respects for  the continued fight and the destruction that this is causing in  the region. Therefore, we must profoundly hope that we can make  a comprehensive peace settlement and we certainly approach the  talks in Geneva with that intent, that one has to say that if  the public statements of the parties are to be believed, then  the prospects are not very good. But let us hope that those are  statements for the morale of the fighting forces and that when  it comes to the actual negotiations, the parties will seek the  difficult compromises which can alone achieve a peace settlement.

0,FT941-10511 ,"FT941-10511 _AN-EBIDBADMFT 940209   FT  09 FEB 94 / Not as bleak as it looks: Some essential truths about Northern Ireland are becoming clear      By IAN DAVIDSON   The London and Dublin governments are to give a new push to their initiative for peace in Northern Ireland. In their joint Anglo-Irish declaration, launched two months ago, they held out the explicit possibility of eventual unification of the two halves of Ireland, if that was what the people of Ireland wanted. But the essential pre-condition for setting this initiative in motion was that the IRA terrorists must first declare a ceasefire. That precondition has not been met. The IRA has not rejected the offer; but the fact that it has not stopped the bombing and shooting suggests that a permanent ceasefire is not very likely. The UK and Irish prime ministers meet next week to see where they go from here; it looks as though they need to think again. The rationale for the December declaration was a belief that the IRA was tired out after 25 years of fruitless terrorism, and might give up. Yet even if the terrorists are tired, it requires great faith to conclude that they can now be converted to democracy. And even if most of the terrorists were prepared to give up, Whitehall officials seem to fear that they may be held hostage by the out-and-out extremists. If the IRA does not agree to give up terrorism, the two governments must rethink their initiative from top to bottom. Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, has said Britain will press ahead with new moves, including devolved local government in the province; perhaps it may. But a political process that leaves out the hard republicans, and perhaps the hard unionists, will be a meagre affair beside the comprehensive agenda of the December declaration. Yet the strategic position may be less bleak than it looks, because various parts of the truth are now being made plain. First, the declaration gives explicit recognition not just to the undeniable old fact, that Northern Ireland is historically and geographically part of Ireland, but also to the new political fact, that its future will be decided not in London but in Ireland. In the introduction to the declaration, the two governments say their aim is 'a new political framework founded on consent'; and a purely British passage says 'it is for the people of Ireland alone, by agreement between the two parts respectively, to exercise their right of self-determination, on the basis of consent, if that is their wish'. Neither passage can give any comfort to rightwing nationalists at Westminster, let alone to die-hard unionists among Northern Irish Protestants. Such an explicit recognition by the UK of the legitimacy of the claims of Irish unity (though only by consent) is unprecedented. But the corollary of the principle of consent is that terrorism, so far from advancing the cause of Irish unity, makes it impossible. The very premise of terrorism is a denial of democracy, the total negation of consent. In Northern Ireland, the two communities are too evenly balanced to admit of a victory of one over the other. IRA terrorism cannot lead to a political victory for the nationalists, because the immediate consequence would be more terrorism by extremist Protestants, most probably a civil war. If the leaders of the IRA were to take up the offer of 'reconciliation, leading to a new political framework', that would be wonderful; but it may be too much of a miracle to hope for. If they do not, then the IRA and Sinn Fein will both be politically dead meat. If they reject the opportunities offered by the declaration, they will have forfeited their claim to speak for the people of Ireland; and they will have shown that terrorism takes precedence over politics, and that Sinn Fein is ruled by the IRA, not the other way round. But whether the IRA says yes or no, the central problem in the declaration is with the definition of the concept of consent. The reason for the terrorism by Catholics and Protestants is that consent is lacking; and even if the terrorism stopped, consent would still be lacking. In fact, there is never likely to be, in our lifetimes, the kind of political majority, either for keeping or for changing the constitutional status quo, which could be counted on to produce a permanent and peaceful settlement of the Northern Ireland question. The corollary is that the medium-term future of Northern Ireland will be decided not by local parties or local majorities, but by agreement between the governments of Britain and Ireland. Sir Patrick Mayhew professes to rule out any idea of joint authority over Northern Ireland; but in strategic terms, that is precisely what is implied by the Anglo-Irish declaration. When the two governments say their aim is 'a new political framework, within Northern Ireland, for the whole island, and between these islands', they are talking about shared authority, almost a de facto condominium. One detailed study* has argued for a de jure condominium, through an Anglo-Irish treaty. This would be an extraordinary innovation in constitutional practice, and would have difficulties with the old-timers in the House of Commons. But it would make logical sense, because it would rule out, for ever, the only grounds for terrorism: the hope of total victory by one community at the expense of the other. And it could also make a creative political contribution to the development of interstate relationships in the context of the European Union. But if London dare not admit the reality of condominium, at least let us have no more talk of self-determination. We have seen what it has achieved in former Yugoslavia, and we do not need that kind of self-determination in Northern Ireland. *Northern Ireland: Sharing Authority, by O'Leary, Lyne, Marshall  Rowthorn, IPPR, 30 Southampton St, London WC2.

Information Minister Jawad al-'Anani told the JORDAN TIMES  that the kindgom is satisfied with the U.S. move, which he said,  had ""removed a major obstacle and has allowed the Kingdom to  shift its position towards renewed participation in the peace  process.""    But he pointed out that the U.S.-Jordan agreement over the  naval blockade in al'Aqabah was not ""100 per cent complete"" and  that the Kingdom was awaiting final agreement and implementation  before announcing its return to the Middle East peace  negotiations.    At a joint conference that followed a meeting in London with  His Majesty King Husayn, U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher announced that ""subject to fine tuning the U.S.  accepted a Jordanian proposal on a new land-based system of  verifying compliance with international sanctions against Iraq  without the need to intercept ships at midsea.    The acceptance came after months of deliberations which  prompted the King to link Jordan's return to the peace talks  with Israel to an end to the sea-based inspections of all  Jordan-bound vessels by a U.S.-led naval force which Washington  calls the Multinational Interception [as published] Force (MIF).    Dr. al-'Anani said that the U.S.' positive response is an  indication of the ""unfolding realisation of Jordan's important  role,"" another issue that Jordan tied to the renewal of Jordan's  participation in the talks.    King Husayn had told representatives of Security Council  member countries that he believed the pressure on Jordan with  the al-'Aqabah siege was humiliting to Jordan and indicated a  lack of appreciation for Jordan's positive role in promoting  peace in the region.    Dr. al-'Anani, who said that the problem with the U.S. could  have been averted earlier, said that this latest move will  contribute positively to the ""credibility of U.S. policies"" in  the Kingdom.    Politicians and analysts interviewed by the JORDAN TIMES  agreed that the Jordan-U.S. agreement has placed Jordan back  into its traditionally important role in the Middle East peace  process.    Jordan had stuck to its conditions out of total frustration  with the U.S. on two occasion where Arabs and Israelis were  meeting for multilateral negotiations, Jordan sent only  low-level observers to attend the meetings and held back ""active  participation.""    In the multilateral meeting on water, held for the first  time  in a Gulf state, Oman, Jordan balanced its need to underline  that it was not going to play a spoiler role by boycotting the  meeting with a reiteration to its ultimatum on al-'Aqabah. The  Jordanian observer to that meeting managed to delay the issuing  of recommendations at the end of that meeting for several hours  before allowing the meeting to conclude for the sake of  maintaining Amman's relations with Muscat.    Observers believe that having been awarded a dignified way  out of what was threatening to escalate into an open  confrontation with Washington, Jordan is now willing to take an  even more active role in the negotiating process with Israel,  especially that a problem that arose earlier this month between  the two countries over the present of Hamas representatives in  Jordan seemed to have been settled.    ""We are now willing to sign agreements on all individual  items on the Jordan-Israeli agenda and to participate in the  multilateral talks on all fronts discussing all issues at one  time in the hope that these negotiations will lead to a peace  treaty,"" Prime Minister 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali told reporters  this week, stressing that such a treaty cannot be reached any  other way.

Present at the talks also were UNPROFOR Commander for Bosnia  General Michael Rose, special envoy of the U.N. High  Commissioner for Refugees Nicholas Morris, and Yugoslav Foreign  Minister Vladislav Jovanovic.    The signing of a peace agreement would avert or discourage  the forces opting for continued war, it was assessed at the  talks.    The evasion of a peace agreement by war option protagonists,  assisted by foreign factors, can only flare up war conflicts  bearing heavy consequences om regional peace and stability, it  was cautioned at the talks.    On Sunday, the Moslem side rejected a draft accord on  lasting  truce in the Sarajevo region as drawn up by Bosnian Serb leader  Radovan Karadzic and Asushi Yakashi. The Moslems also turned  down a peace plan by the European Union (E.U.) in Geneva twenty  days ago, opting for war and trying to win out military  intervention against Bosnian Serbs.    A resumption of political talks, to which the Serb side  commits itself and on which the international community would  have to insist strongly, is the only rasonable road to peace, it  was said at the talks.    It was pointed out that Serbia, as it has been doing so far,  would lend support to peace efforts by the United Nations in the  areas of former Yugoslavia.     "

High on  the talks, which will be attended by senior Jordanian and  American officials, are Jordanian-U.S. ties and regional issues.    Earlier today, his majesty visited the Congress, and met  separately with Speaker of the House of Representatives Thomas  Foley, and the House Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Lee  Hamilton, and 23 committee members.    The committee had asked for the meeting for a briefing from  his majesty on the latest developments related to the Middle  East peace process. Members of the House Committee said  Jordanian-U.S. relations had developed after the Gulf war. They  said they understood problems facing Jordan and many committee  members said they would support Jordan in view of its positive  stand toward the peace process and the democratic climate  prevailing in the Kingdom.    His majesty told the committee that Jordan would act  according to the agenda with Israel on the agreement two weeks  ago on border demarcation, water, and security issues. His  majesty said the agreement was progress towards peace, and added  that Jordan will demand completion of other items on the agenda.  His majesty told the House Committee it was premature to talk  about the proposed confederation between Jordan and the  Palestinians, and both peoples could choose the sort of  relationship between them when the Palestinians gain their  rights on their national soil.    Asked if Jordan would sign a peace treaty with Israel after  the border and water issues are resolved, his majesty said  Jordan would act according to the agenda, noting that Jordan is  a sovereign country and an advocate of Arab coordination.    His majesty said a speedy peace treaty primarily depended on  Israel's response to the requirements and conditions of peace.  His majesty said lifting the Arab boycott against Israel  depended largely on the results of negotiations ending the  blockade of Jordanian goods bound for the occupied Palestinian  lands, and a reconsideration of Israel's protectionist policy.    His majesty told the House Foreign Relations Committee that  Islam is a religion of moderation, and fundamentalism was not  restricted to Islam, but there were other extremist religious  movements, and Islam should not be viewed through fundamentalism.    His majesty said Jordan would offer all possible support for  the Palestinian administration in the autonomous areas.    Yesterday, his majesty met U.S. Secretary of Defense William  Perry following talks with Secretary of State Warren Christopher  and other U.S. administration officials.    During their meetings, both sides have underlined the  closeness of bilateral relations.     "

However, in a move that augured badly for the future pariticipation of the hardline Democratic Unionist party in talks, the Rev Ian Paisley, the party's leader, unexpectedly delivered a letter protesting against the holding of yesterday's Anglo-Irish intergovernmental conference session in Belfast. It emerged earlier this week that the UK government was prepared to press ahead with the peace process even without DUP participation. Yesterday's conference followed on from the start of the new peace initiative of Mr John Major, the British prime minister, and Mr Albert Reynolds, his Irish counterpart, in Brussels last week. After the meeting Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, and Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, expressed optimism that the two governments would press ahead quickly towards a new constitutional settlement. They made clear that dialogue would initially take the form of bilateral discussions with British ministers. Sir Patrick warned that an immediate push for resumption of round-table discussions with all parties could be counter-productive. 'The only point in getting around the table is when there is an agreement achievable,' he said. One possible target would be to have an agreement in place before Mr Major and Mr Reynolds meet at the UK-Ireland summit in Dublin within six weeks. Sir Patrick said the six-point plan put forward by Mr Spring last week would be 'central to the ideas that the two governments must bring to a conclusion between themselves'. The plan showed 'very encouraging evidence of the thinking of the Irish government'. Sir Patrick also spoke of the 'unbreakable meshing' between the UK-Irish talks and what the province's political parties were 'prepared to compromise over' regarding the internal government of Northern Ireland. Sir Patrick said there was 'no question at the moment' of having reached the stage where Ireland's constitutional claim to jurisdiction over Northern Ireland would be replaced or where the Anglo-Irish agreement was 'going to be repealed'.

0,FT931-15849 ,"FT931-15849 _AN-DAKB8AAFFT 930111   FT  11 JAN 93 / France may use force over camps in Bosnia: Paris ready to act alone as Geneva negotiations remain deadlocked      By ROBERT MAUTHNER and ALICE RAWSTHORN      GENEVA, PARIS   FRANCE said yesterday it was prepared to act alone if necessary to liberate by force Bosnian prisoner camps where civilians are reported to have been raped and tortured. The suggestion, made by Mr Roland Dumas, foreign minister, came as negotiations for a peace settlement remained deadlocked in Geneva. Speaking on France's RTL radio, Mr Dumas said: 'I suggest . . . we ensure that this liberation is put into effect if necessary by force, since we now have the legal right to intervene and there is evidence of the existence of these camps and of tortures and rape that are committed there.' In Bosnia-Hercegovina, British troops yesterday returned fire against Serb positions for the third time, the first time with cannons, after coming under attack while escorting an aid convoy. No injuries were reported. The UK government is expected to decide soon about sending reinforcements. The aircraft carrier Ark Royal has been placed on alert. Mr Dumas said he had asked Health and Humanitarian Affairs Minister Mr Bernard Kouchner to arrange 'if necessary on our own' for convoys under military escort to go to the camps and liberate them. The French foreign minister's remarks follow the assassination in Sarajevo on Friday by a Serb militiaman of Mr Hakija Turajlic, the Bosnian deputy prime minister, in the presence of French peacekeeping troops, and a visit to Paris at the weekend by Bosnian leader Mr Alija Izetbegovic. It is not clear whether Mr Dumas's threat of unilateral action amounts to a plan. French officials said his proposal to liberate the Bosnians from Serbian camps would only be implemented with the United Nations' sanction. But his statement underlined the intensifying pressures on the French and other western governments to intervene militarily in Bosnia-Hercegovina should the current round of peace talks fail. Diplomats at the UN are preparing a resolution authorising enforcement of a no-fly zone over Bosnia which may pass within days. Separately, a group of Islamic states is meeting in Dakar, the Senegalese capital, today to discuss increasing their support for Bosnian Moslems. Yesterday's clash between British troops attached to the UN in Bosnia and Serbian forces took place near the town of Kladanj as the troops were returning to their base from Tuzla on the route used daily by aid convoys. After coming under fire from Serbian positions, the British troops responded with cannons, firing 17 rounds from light tanks and over 100 rounds from machine guns. Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, has urged that international military intervention be delayed to give peace a last chance. In an interview to be published today in the US magazine Newsweek, Lord Owen, co-chairman of the Geneva peace conference on former Yugoslavia, said such western intervention on the ground would be taken by the Serbs to imply UN support for the Moslems. 'That isn't to say I would rule out a military option,' he said. 'But I'd ask myself, 'What are you doing it for?' Have no doubt: once there's intervention . . . The United Nations will be associated in Serb eyes with the Moslems.' In Geneva yesterday, new proposals by the Bosnian Serbs, intended to give the impression that they may compromise, proved unacceptable to the Bosnian Moslems and international mediators. However, the fact that the talks were resumed at all came as a relief to Lord Owen and Mr Cyrus Vance, his co-chairman. Mr Izetbegovic, the Bosnian president, left the talks in the afternoon for the conference of Islamic states in Dakar. But Mr Vance and Lord Owen emphasised his departure was not 'a walk-out'. They said he would be back in Geneva tonight and would be at the talks on Tuesday. Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian president, who it is hoped will put pressure on the Bosnian Serbs to reach an agreement, is also due to join the negotiations today or tomorrow.

The session was attended by senior Armed Forces commanders  from both countries. At the beginning of the session, Lt. Gen.  Halabi made a speech stressing that it is high time, now that we  are at the doorstep of the 21st century, to work together for  the good and safety of our peoples and to deepen the concept of  an overall security for all mankind, so that the next century  may be one of security and stability for all the world.    Lt. Gen. Halabi added: We look forward to a world marked by  amity, accord, wellbeing, and common action for the coming  generations, which we do not want to suffer from the wars that  our generations have gone through. We also call for a  comprehensive disarmament and a ban on nuclear, biological, and  chemical tests so that humanity may stay free of any threat to  its security and well-being, he added.    Lt. Gen. Halabi noted that Egypt took it upon itself to  promote peace in the Arab region after it had chosen a clear  path. He noted that all parties must have equal faith in the  need to achieve a just, lasting, and comprehensive peace in our  region to achieve a bright future and security for the region's  peoples. He hoped that today's talks will lead to fruitful  results as far as joint action is concerned to preserve security  and stability in the region as well as in Europe. He added:  Egypt's participation in the European security conference in  Rome a few months ago was an indication of the role we could  play in this regard.    The talks dealt with all aspects of military cooperation  between Egypt and German and ways of developing them.     "

It added that Washington's apparent change of heart is due  to  two major causes -- the limitation of the U.S. influence in the  Middle East resulted from the region's cordial relations with  Iran and failure of the U.S.-imposed Middle East peace talks  which makes Washington to use Tehran's ""spiritual influence"" in  the Islamic world to revive and legitimize the peace accord.    ""Iran has endeavored to stay faithful to its own Islamic  revolution while leaving open the possibility of reconciliation  with the U.S. provided that America releases Iran's assets and  refrains from covert and overt operations aimed at isolating and  destabilizing the Islamic Republic.""    In the case of re-establishment of ties with Iran, the U.S.  would stand to gain a lot more than Iran, therefore, it should  be prepared to make greater concessions, said the daily in  conclusion noting that Iranian officials are well aware of this  fact and would base their demands accordingly.

0,FT944-18413 ,"FT944-18413 _AN-EJDDVACZFT 941004   FT  04 OCT 94 / US ends ban on meetings with Sinn Fein      By GEORGE GRAHAM   Pressure on London to clear the way for preliminary talks with Sinn Fein mounted significantly yesterday as the US launched the start of 'a normal relationship' with the IRA's political wing. Mr Al Gore, US vice-president, informed Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein's president, in a telephone call that the US was ending its formal policy of not meeting Sinn Fein officials. A senior administration official said: 'The way to read this is the beginning of a relationship with Sinn Fein, a party with whom we've had no official contacts for 25 years.' Mr Gore's telephone call appeared carefully calibrated to raise the contact with Mr Adams to the highest level possible without offending the British government by a meeting at the White House. Although Mr Adams has been pressing for a week for a more conspicuous meeting with Mr Bill Clinton, US president, or Mr Gore, administration officials said he had not made any formal request for such a meeting. Downing Street's response to the telephone call was low-key. Officials emphasised that 'the Americans have got to decide for themselves' how they receive Mr Adams. The government is analysing with great care remarks made by Sinn Fein's president during his second visit to the US this year. London has promised to begin a dialogue on admitting Sinn Fein to talks on Northern Ireland's future within three months of a permanent end to IRA violence, but it is still not convinced that the month-old ceasefire is for good. Senior officials said yesterday that every day which passed 'without violence, without killing' gave grounds for optimism. A first meeting will take place today at the State Department between Mr Adams and Mr John Kornblum, deputy assistant secretary of state for European affairs. Mr Kornblum will be joined by Mr Leon Fuerth, national security adviser to Mr Gore, and Ms Nancy Soderberg, staff director of the White House National Security Council. In a letter to Mr Adams Mr Anthony Lake, Mr Clinton's principal national security adviser, said the Sinn Fein leader's 'role in bringing about the IRA ceasefire was a courageous step forward for peace'. A senior US official said the letter had been 'carefully written' so as 'not to get into word-games' over Mr Adams's refusal to describe the ceasefire as 'permanent'. Yesterday's move came as Mr Adams prepared for a high-profile television debate with Mr Ken Maginnis, the Ulster Unionist MP for Fermanagh and South Tyrone.

In comments made less than 48 hours before a decision on the ban is due, Downing Street said it hoped a visa would not be given to Mr Adams unless he made 'a clear and unequivocal renunciation of violence'. It was 'deeds not words' that were required. It said the government had been in talks with the US on the subject. The signal came as the IRA left fire bombs at three stores in London. Yesterday also saw two sectarian murders in Ulster. The attacks came on the eve of the first session of the Anglo-Irish inter-governmental conference since the two governments unveiled their joint peace initiative in December. The conference is likely to provide the opportunity for both governments to reaffirm their joint position on the peace initiative. A display of unity over the progress of the political talks co-ordinated by Mr Michael Ancram, the Northern Ireland minister, may be harder to engineer. London has indicated that it intends to act, as promised, to give focus to the talks fairly soon, although this may come in bilateral and private sessions. Dublin is anxious not to divert attention from the peace process. Mr Adams recently applied for a visa at the American Embassy in Dublin after receiving an invitation to attend a conference in New York on Monday. Under US immigration law, he is still officially ineligible for a visa but a waiver can be issued by the attorney general on recommendation from Mr Warren Christopher, the secretary of state. It is understood that President Bill Clinton has been involved in the decision-making process and that a series of meetings took place in Washington on Wednesday. A number of Irish-American politicians have lobbied on Mr Adams' behalf. The leaders of the Ulster Unionists and the hardline Democratic Unionist party have already declined an invitation to attend the conference. Mr John Hume, leader of the mainly Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party, and Dr John Alderdice, leader of the Alliance party, are expected to attend. Unionist politicians and leaders of loyalist terrorist groups in Northern Ireland have met to discuss the Downing Street declaration, according to the BBC television programme Spotlight, which is shown only in Northern Ireland. According to the programme, the paramilitaries, represented by the combined loyalist military command have been seeking clarification of the opposing views on the declaration taken by the Democratic Unionist and Ulster Unionist parties.

By KIM MURPHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER      CAIRO      The Palestine Liberation Organization, struggling to maintain its role in  negotiating the future of Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied territories,  declined on Friday to accept or reject a U.S. peace plan and instead submitted  a request for clarification of the plan.    Following a meeting of the PLO leadership late Thursday in Tunis, a PLO envoy  arrived here Friday with a list of questions about a plan drawn up by Secretary  of State James A.

Among the more mainstream markets, India saw a half year rise of 13 per cent in dollar terms, in spite of higher inflation and lower economic growth prospects. But in Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia falls ranged between 21 and 25 per cent. In North Africa, Egypt advanced by 63 per cent in local currency terms helped by a pick-up in the country's privatisation programme, while Tunisia improved by 35 per cent.

The White Tiger Investment Company will aim for a size of Dollars 20m in the first 18 months, investing in traded companies on the Moscow and St Petersburg stock exchanges, with up to 20 per cent going to the Far Eastern region centred on Vladivostok. JORDAN Until now, 1994 has not been a good year for the Amman financial market, writes James Whittington in Amman. Investors have been jittery over progress in the Middle East peace talks and the market has so far been stuck in a downward slide. Last week the index fell to a year's low of 142.81 which represents an 8 per cent drop from the beginning of the year. Local analysts believe that this poor performance is set to change as Jordanian and Israeli negotiators meet in the region today to push forward their peace talks amid real signs of progress. They say the market has reached the bottom of its decline and an upward trend is now likely, although it will still remain highly sensitive to any disruptions in the peace talks.

Dr. Mundhir Haddadin said Jordan's low-key participation was  to protest the failure of American naval forces to lift the  blockade of the Port of al-'Aqabah.    He said His Majesty King Husayn had made it clear that  Jordan's participation in the fifth round of water talks would  be at the observer level if inspections of Jordan-bound ships  continued.    Dr. Haddadin said Jordan would also scale down its  delegations to other multilateral talks if the blockade on  al-'Aqabah persisted. He said the fifth round of talks on  disarmament and regional security would be held in Qatar early  next month, and talks on refugees and economic development would  convene in Egypt and Morocco respectively.    Forty countries, including Israel, are attending the Oman  round and Jordan is represented by the adviser to the minister  of water and irrigation.    In the previous four sessions at the water conference,  Jordan  had participated with a six-member delegation.     "

Reporters were turned away from the talks at a hotel in the  north Mogadishu enclave of General Aidid's enemy self-styled  interim president Ali Mahdi Mohamed.    The secretary of the meeting, Mohamed Hassan, declined to  give details on progress at the talks, bringing together members  of Aidid's Habr Gedir sub-clan and Ali Mahdi's Abgal under the  chairmanship of a prominent Islamic leader, the Imam of Hirab,  without UN involvement. He said the participants, traditional  clan leaders and elders rather than warlords such as Aidid and  Ali Mahdi, would issue a statement when the meeting concluded  ""in a couple of days.""    Ahmed Darman, a member of the central committee of Aidid's  Somali National Alliance (SNA) faction, confirmed that Habr  Gedir representatives were attending. ""The talks have been  going on over the past month in order to create an atmosphere of  understanding among the sub-clans,"" Darman told reporters at the  SNA office in Aidid's south Mogadishu stronghold. ""Both groups  are well represented on the basis of the sub-clans, not  political organisations,"" he said.    Fighting between Ali Mahdi's Abgal forces and Aidid's Habr  Gedir militia reduced much of central Mogadishu to rubble before  the first U.S. troops landed in December 1992 to end a famine  that killed an estimated 300,000 people.    Darman, a former Somali ambassador to the United States and  China, expressed optimism about the outcome of the talks. ""I  don't think there will again be war in Mogadishu between the  Abgal and the Habr Gedir,"" he said.    Ali Mahdi, however, has repeatedly warned that civil war  will  engulf Somalia after U.S. troops leave in March. He has urged  the UN to keep peacekeepers here despite Aidid's insistence that  they must go.    Aidid, Ali Mahdi, and 13 other factional leaders agreed at  UN- brokered talks in March to form a transitional national  council to govern Somalia for two years until elections. But  the process was halted by Aidid's conflict with the United  Nations, which cost the lives of more than 70 peacekeepers  before the world body dropped efforts to arrest the warlord in  October. Further UN-sponsored peace talks sponsored in Addis  Ababa last month collapsed without agreement. African and  Western diplomats have since voiced mounting pessimism about the  likelihood of a negotiated settlement.    Darman said the current clan meeting signalled a new  initiative, together with talks he said were going on in Nairobi  between Aidid and representatives of a group of 12 factions that  oppose him, led by Ali Mahdi.    Darman said eight senior SNA officials with Aidid in Nairobi  had been negotiating for two or three days with eight delegates  from the group of 12 led by Abdullahi Yusuf, leader of a faction  that controls northeast Somalia.    Sources close to Ali Mahdi said he was in daily contact by  telephone with General Abdullahi, whose Somali Salvation  Democratic Alliance belongs to the group of 12. But Ali Mahdi  himself was not immediately available to confirm that talks were  being held.    Darman said an agreement on Somalia's political future had  nearly been reached in Nairobi, but the 12 had backed out at the  last moment.    The head of the UN Operation in Somalia, Jonathan Howe,  seemed unaware of the clan talks in Mogadishu, but stressed that  ""there's a lot of dialogue going on.""    ""It's a Somali process,"" he said Wednesday in remarks seen  as  a shift by the UN towards playing a less directive role in  brokering the restoration of civilian authority in Somalia,  without a government since the 1991 overthrow of former ruler  Mohamed Siad Barre.

By DANIEL WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER      JERUSALEM      Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir expressed impatience Monday with the reluctance  of the Bush Administration to break off talks with the Palestine Liberation  Organization over an abortive guerrilla raid.    Shamir also said it is the policy of his new government to increase the numbers  of Jewish residents in existing settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.  But he suggested that no new settlements would be built in the foreseeable  future, government radio reported, although the principle of colonizing the  Israeli-held land remains in effect.    ""More important now is to take care of the existing settlements, to develop  them, to advance their population,"" Shamir said.    Shamir has pressed for suspension of the U.S.-PLO talks since they began in  December, 1988, and his campaign was given new life by the failed attack by a  PLO faction on the Israeli shoreline May 30.    The Bush Administration characterized the raid as a terror attack and demanded  that the PLO not only condemn it but expel its architect, Mohammed Abbas, alias  Abul Abbas, who is a member of the PLO executive committee.    So far, the PLO has stopped short of condemning the raid, by the Palestine  Liberation Front, and made it clear that Abul Abbas will not be expelled under  pressure from Washington.    Shamir wants the United States to make good on its threat to end the talks.  Under terms set by the Reagan Administration, contact with the PLO depended on  the group's abandonment of terror tactics.    ""We were sure that no one in the United States would dare to say to us that  again this time they have doubts,"" Shamir told a group of high school students  in the city of Petah Tikva. ""What do we see? Week after week passes and they  are still holding consultations, there in the political offices in the United  States, about whether indeed the PLO is still a terrorist organization.""    Shamir's statement is the latest round of critical exchanges between the two  governments. Last week, Secretary of State James A. Baker III urged Shamir to  take up his offer to start peace talks with Palestinians. Shamir has refused  because the Bush Administration plan would give an offstage role to the PLO,  which is demanding the formation of a Palestinian state next to Israel.    In Washington, U.S. officials said Monday that President Bush, in a letter, has  called on Shamir to explain what he is willing to do to revive peace efforts.  The letter, which included a conciliatory note of congratulations on the  formation of a new Israeli government, said Bush hopes Shamir remains committed  to his own plan of last year, which called for elections of Palestinian  representatives in the occupied areas.    Shamir is at the head of a newly formed right-wing government and has been  trying to shift the focus of its diplomacy from the question of Israel's rule  over 1.7 million Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip to the country's  relations with the Arab world at large.    In his remarks in Petah Tikva, Shamir repeated that his government program  gives full priority to the successful immigration of Soviet Jews.    Shamir also invited Syria's president, Hafez Assad, to come to Jerusalem and  talk peace. Syria is demanding return of the Golan Heights, which Israel won  while repelling a joint Arab invasion in 1967 and annexed 14 years later.    ""If the Syrian president wants to come to Israel for talks with us without  preconditions, we will meet him and welcome him,"" Shamir said.    Last March, former U.S. President Jimmy Carter delivered a message from Assad  indicating the Syrian president's willingness to hold peace talks, although  such negotiations would ""obviously include the Golan Heights.""    The foreign policy transition in the new Shamir government began roughly, with  complaints from the new Foreign Minister David Levy that Shamir is dealing with  Washington without consulting him. According to Israeli newspaper reports, an  aide to Shamir told Bush Administration officials that talks with Palestinians  under Baker's plan are out of the question.    In retaliation, Levy blocked delivery of a letter to Egyptian officials through  Israel's embassy in Cairo, the newspaper Haaretz reported.    A spokesman for Levy said the flap was ""blown out of proportion.""

Both U.S. special envoy for Yugoslavia Charles Redman and  his  Russian counterpart Vitaly Churkin are attending the talks in  which the 12 European Community states, Canada and UN officials  are also represented.    The talks, in a hotel at Bad Godesberg, come as Russia is  proposing an international conference to try to settle the  situation in former Yugoslavia.    Moscow's return to the world diplomatic front line on the  issue coincides with the despatch of Russian troops to Sarajevo  to join in UN demilitarisation efforts following the withdrawal  of Serb artillery under threats from NATO.    Germany has also been closely associated with latest Bosnian  peace efforts.    Chancellor Helmut Kohl who has been in close telephone touch  with U.S. President Bill Clinton and Russian President Boris  Yeltsin on the Bosnian crisis, Monday backed the proposal of a  ""high-level"" international conference.    Yeltsin said Monday that the main three themes of the talks  would be the situation in Sarajevo, other intended zones of  security in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and a peace plan.    French President Francois Mitterrand said Monday he was  calling on the UN Security Council to put Sarajevo under UN  administration.     "
0,FT932-11251 ,"FT932-11251 _AN-DEECIAD6FT 930505   FT  05 MAY 93 / US, France agree Bosnia tactics: Possible Serb rejection of peace plan discussed by Major and Balladur      By DAVID BUCHAN and ROBERT MAUTHNER      PARIS, LONDON   THE US and France yesterday agreed that a large United Nations peacekeeping force must be sent to Bosnia rapidly if the Bosnian Serb assembly approves an international peace plan at its meeting today, but made no final decision on what action to take if the plan was rejected. After talks in Paris with Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, Mr Alain Juppe, the French foreign minister, claimed there was 'a broad convergence of views' between Paris and Washington on tactics, even if the assembly rejected the plan. In that event, 'new measures will have to be taken, and nothing is excluded', Mr Juppe said in an apparent reference to US ideas on air strikes against Bosnian Serb supply lines and other military targets. He seemed to concede that military threats constituted useful pressure on the Bosnian Serb parliament's meeting, even though France would clearly be reluctant to see its 5,500 peacekeepers in former Yugoslavia put at risk by air attacks. After talks in Downing Street last night with Mr John Major, the prime minister, Mr Edouard Balladur, his French counterpart, said the two governments' views on what could be done should the Bosnian Serb assembly reject the peace agreement were close. But, apart from stressing they had reviewed all options, neither he nor Mr Major would disclose their preferences. Although Mr Major said 'we have never ruled out air strikes', a French official said later that the two premiers had shown a 'common reticence' about US proposals to bomb Bosnian Serb supply lines. Reports from Pale, the seat of the Bosnian Serb assembly, suggest its members are split over whether to endorse the peace plan signed by their leader, Mr Radovan Karadzic, on Sunday, in spite of thinly veiled warnings by western powers that they risk bombing raids if they reject it. There are no signs on the ground that the Bosnian Serbs are prepared to implement a ceasefire ahead of their assembly's decision. Bosnia's Moslems yesterday accused Serb forces of launching a fierce artillery attack on the eastern enclave of Zepa and of burning villages on the town's outskirts. They called for an urgent meeting of the UN Security Council to discuss measures to save the besieged town. Serb forces later denied they had started the fighting. In a letter to Mr Yuli Vorontsov of Russia, the UN Security Council president, President Alija Izetbegovic of Bosnia urged the council to declare Zepa a UN protected area and to send a company of UN troops to 'defend' it and the civilian population. Mr Cyrus Vance, the UN peace mediator, said he would ask Mr Karadzic and Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic to investigate and stop the fighting in the town. Meanwhile, plans for a large multinational peacekeeping force of up to 75,000 men to implement a peace agreement once it has been endorsed are due to be discussed by Nato's military committee in Brussels today.

His Majesty King Husayn said that this will be the  last opportunity for understanding. How do you explain His  Majesty King Husayn's remarks in this regard?    [Al-'Anani] I believe that His Majesty King Husayn's speech  is based on a very strong concern, as usual, about making the  Jordanian-Palestinian coordination on the highest level and very  clear. This is because everyone is watching this relationship  and many decisions will be made in accordance with this  relationship. The other thing is that time is passing quickly  and that events are changing rapidly. Moreover, there are  timetables included in the Jordanian-Palestinian agreement.  These timetables set dates for accomplishing matters. So, out  of his concern about making this relationship clear and  proceeding within sound frameworks, especially since any  agreement between the Palestinians and Israelis affects us and  the current peace talks affect both of us a great deal,  coordination is a must. Based on this, postponing this issue or  making Jordan wait longer than it should, will reflect  negatively on us and on the Palestinian brothers. Therefore, I  see in his majesty's remarks a strong concern about the  importance of this cooperation and the need to put it within a  set timetable so that it will not continue to be without set  dates and results. Here lies the importance of His Majesty King  Husayn's remarks.    [Reporter] What can we discern about Jordan's negotiating  strategy from His Majesty King Husayn's speech concerning a  peace treaty?    [Al-'Anani] I believe that His Majesty King Husayn has a  great deal of experience regarding the Arab-Israeli  relationship. He has continuously proven that he is farsighted  concerning many issues. His awareness has preceded that of  others most, if not all, of the time. So, his majesty knows  full well that the peace talks should not lead to a treaty,  except at the end. In other words, you must resolve all  relevant issues. This is what was included in the  Jordanian-Israeli agenda. First we should discuss water,  people, land, and many other issues related to the peace process  such as the refugees and the displaced issue. When all these  issues are settled and when we become certain that peace will be  just and comprehensive on all fronts and cover all these issues,  then the talk about a peace treaty becomes clear.    If we declare an intention to sign agreements and going on  to talk about them, we leave the field open for  misunderstandings and various interpretations that could hold up  the entire the peace process. There is a logical sequence that  his majesty's speech made clear.    [Reporter] His majesty spoke about certain fears being  raised about an Israeli domination under peace?    [Al-'Anani] His majesty's speech has made it absolutely  clear that, as a man of vision, certain pieces of advice he has  given to his brother Arab leaders, have turned out to be the  right counsel. Take what happened in the 1967 war when we joined  a war for which we were caught unprepared and thus passed up the  opportunity to be better prepared in the future. Again,  consider the Khartoum no's of the 1969 Arab summit. These  created an emotionally charged atmosphere in which we could not  bring our calmer reason to bear in weighing things and making  the right decisions. The result has been agreements inferior to  what we may have otherwise obtained. Now, his majesty has drawn  attention to fears being raised with a view to delaying  negotiations about peace. His majesty says that the Arab  world's squandering of or failure to put the assets and  resources it has at its command to good use may lie at the heart  of the conflict. His majesty also blames Arab disarray. If we  close ranks, as his majesty has been urging, and if we marshal  Arab resources in the peace battle, we will not enable Israel to  control the Arabs. We know that in the year 2025, there will be  600 million Arabs. What will Israel be like then? Indeed,  Israel has more to fear from the peace process. It is agonizing  over the decision whether or not to make peace. Given its  assets and resources, however, the Arab world is well positioned  to counter Israeli or any other hegemony.     "
0,FT931-10380 ,"FT931-10380 _AN-DBICOADNFT 930209   FT  09 FEB 93 / Big stick from Rabin gets in the way of the carrot: Hugh Carnegy on the battered hopes of an era of conciliation under an Israeli PM with a vision of peace      By HUGH CARNEGY   LITTLE more than six months after Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin took office proclaiming a vision of at last achieving peace between Israel and its Arab foes, the self-inflicted crisis over Palestinian expulsions has battered hopes of his presiding over an era of conciliation. Instead, many Israeli supporters of Mr Rabin's centre-left coalition fear that what they regard as his dictatorial style of government has led the country into an impasse in the Middle East peace talks which will be hard to resolve. From the Palestinian point of view, the expulsions and accompanying violence, such as the seven killings in the occupied territories over the weekend, have compounded anger over what they say has been a sharp deterioration in human rights abuses by Israel under Mr Rabin, in particular in the Gaza Strip. Palestinians express increasing scepticism about carrying on negotiations for self-rule that have so far yielded no tangible improvement in their lot. Last week, complaints about Mr Rabin from the left wing of his own Labour party burst into the open when Mr Hagai Merom, a Labour MP, attacked him in the Knesset. Mr Merom said Mr Rabin failed to consult his ministers and then suppressed criticism, first over the December decision to expel 400 alleged Islamic militants, and then over a compromise deal with the US to allow 100 to return. 'Recently, Mr Prime Minister, there is fear in the cabinet. It is not good that there is fear in the cabinet. I don't think a minister who disagrees should be attacked, especially if he is the justice minister,' Mr Merom said. He was referring to Mr David Liba'i, the minister of justice, who was given just 10 minutes notice of the December deportation orders by Mr Rabin. When he tried to raise his objections at a subsequent cabinet meeting he was abruptly overruled by the prime minister. There is a certain disingenuous quality to this criticism as every minister except Mr Liba'i, including the cabinet's most noted doves, voted in favour of the deportations when Mr Rabin informed them of his intentions. But Mr Rabin's critics say the diplomatic and political mess precipitated by the expulsions was the consequence of his preference for keeping decision-making firmly within a small circle of aides in the prime minister's office and the military establishment. Mr Rabin holds the powerful defence portfolio as well as the premiership. An important part of the miscalculation was the assumption that, at least privately, leaders of the Palestine Liberation Organisation would welcome tough action against their Islamic fundamentalist rival, Hamas, and would not stay away from Middle East peace talks in protest. This ignored the deep Palestinian fear of arbitrary expulsion that transcends narrower affiliations with political factions. The mass deportations also hit the Palestinians at a time when resentment against Mr Rabin's tough security policies was already running high in the occupied territories. A former army chief of staff, Mr Rabin has long been an advocate of wielding a big stick in concert with the carrot of peace talks. According to figures from Betzelem, an Israeli human rights group, Palestinian fatalities rose by 20 per cent in the first six months of Mr Rabin's rule to 76 dead, compared with 63 in the first six months of the year. The number of children under 15 years of age killed almost trebled to 18. Two-thirds of all deaths did not involve circumstances in which soldiers' lives were in danger, also a sharp rise over the preceding period. 'I think we have witnessed the worst period since Rabin was defence minister (up to mid-1990). People are being killed at a very high rate, houses are now being destroyed by anti-tank missiles and hundreds of people have been deported,' says Mr Saeb Erekat, a member of the Palestinian delegation to the peace talks. 'This is having a great impact. People are blaming the peace process for Rabin's actions - saying the talks give him the cover to do these things.' Mr Rabin responds to such criticism with characteristic disdain towards Israeli doves and Palestinians alike. He insists he has not retreated from his commitment to make compromises for peace and is anxious for negotiations to resume. But he has made no secret of his regret that he has not been able, due to a combination of political rivalries and Knesset mathematics, to bring right-wing parties into the government to balance the left-liberal Meretz coalition partner. 'He definitely has mixed feelings about (his coalition), but he is caught in a situation which he can't change,' says Prof Avraham Diskin, head of the political science department at Hebrew University. 'Part of his behaviour towards the doves in the coalition is because of that.' The question now is whether Mr Rabin can pull his government through the expulsions crisis and, assuming the peace negotiations can be rebuilt, retain the domestic political authority required to make the concessions demanded of Israel. Prof Diskin thinks he can. 'However you look at it, the government is weakened. It cannot afford many more errors. But after all Labour is still the pivotal party. It can still go forward.'

This is because Jordan plays an important and  vital role in the peace process.    The remarks were made in a news conference Hurd held in  Amman  this afternoon at the conclusion of a two-day visit to Jordan,  during which he met with His Majesty King Husayn and the prime  minister. Hurd also had talks on developments in the peace  process and ways to enhance bilateral cooperation.    More details in the following report:    Hurd said his talks in Amman were positive and that Jordan  and Britain look forward to making the peace process succeed,  despite the existence of some difficulties, which should be  overcome. He asserted that the peace process has passed the  point of no return and it is impossible to go back.    Hurd expressed his full understanding of, and deep respect  for, His Majesty King Husayn's view that all matters should be  settled before any agreement with Israel is signed. He said: I  fully understand the reasons that prompted his majesty to adopt  this policy. He further said that much has been achieved on the  Jordanian-Israeli track, noting that there are other things  which should be done.    Hurd stressed his country's economic support for Jordan,  saying: We have an economic aid program for Jordan and we will  implement this program to support Jordan's needs. He pointed to  his meeting today with the water minister and to Britain's role  in extending aid to carry out a water project in southern  Jordan. He also underlined the need to ease the burdens of  Jordan's indebtedness and support its economy in facing many  burdens as a result of the continued economic embargo against  Iraq. He said he discussed with Jordanian officials ways to  overcome difficulties to increase the volume of trade between  Jordan and Britain. He added that he had discussed with  Jordanian officials the negative impact of the economic embargo  against Iraq, noting that Jordan feels that it bears a great  burden as a result of this embargo, more than other neighboring  countries of Iraq.    Hurd underscored his statements in the Gaza Strip yesterday  before arriving in Amman in which he asserted his government's  support for the Palestinian people through extending technical  expertise directly or through the Economic Community and the  United Nations, especially for the Palestinian self-rule region.  He said: We cannot do more than this because the United States  and Russia are directly responsible for the peace process. He  asserted that the concerned parties in the region are determined  to achieve peace and that the will for success is greater than  failure, since failure means the return of tension to the region.    Hurd expressed his belief that Israel has no ambitions in  Lebanon, pointing out that it seeks to protect its security and  that it has no desire to annex Lebanese territory. He  reaffirmed the need for Israel's implementation of relevant  Security Council resolutions. He said that reaching a solution  on the Lebanese-Israeli track can happen at the same time as  other solutions on other tracks are being reached within a  comprehensive solution.    He also expressed his belief that Arab-Israeli disputes are  over. We are now in a stage of direct contacts and negotiations,  which is the only course to achieve positive results and  practical decisions and implement them.    He denied he was mediating between the Arabs and the  Israelis, saying his tour of the region is aimed at listening to  the views of the parties concerned, conveying views from one  side to another, and helping clarify these ideas.    Hurd and his wife left Amman this afternoon for Malta on the  fourth leg of his Middle East tour. He was seen off at the  airport by Talal Sat'an al-Hasan, minister of state for foreign  affairs; Nayif al-Hadid, the Foreign Ministry secretary general;  senior Foreign Ministry officials, and the British ambassador in  Amman.

Arafat declared, waving one of the  controversial new identity cards required of residents in the occupied  territories to help quell the 21-month-old Palestinian uprising. ""You have to  help me reject it, because I'm a human being, like you.""    In a sometimes heated exchange with Israeli journalists after a meeting with  Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Arafat refused to commit himself on Mubarak's  10-point peace initiative, but he did endorse the Egyptian leader's proposal  for direct talks between Israelis and Palestinians -- as long as the ground  rules are left open.    ""I have agreed to the preliminary conference that Mr. Mubarak has proposed,""  Arafat said, ""but open talks, without conditions. Not your conditions, not my  conditions. No preconditions. Fair?""    While Egyptian and some moderate Israeli leaders have proposed the talks as a  prelude to elections in the occupied territories, which would select a  delegation to decide final peace issues, Arafat insisted that the talks lead  the way to an international conference on peace in the Middle East.    ""It's our right to demand what we want,"" Arafat said, ""and it's their right to  demand what they want. That's fair enough. Or aren't you democratic? Have you  been a little bit affected by the armed (Jewish) settlers (in the occupied  territories)?""    Many of the PLO leader's remarks were aimed directly at the Israeli  journalists, whose request to interview Arafat prompted the press conference,  which included other reporters as well. Israeli citizens by law are barred from  contacts with the PLO except through ""international"" press conferences.      Appeals to Israeli Public    At times, the repartee became heated, as the Israeli journalists demanded to  know whether the PLO would promise permanent peace if it were granted a  Palestinian state in the West Bank, whether Israel should be negotiating with a  group it considers a terrorist organization and why the PLO doesn't call a  cease-fire in the uprising, or intifada, as a prelude to any peace talks.    Arafat, in turn, used the occasion to appeal directly to the Israeli public,  often framing his comments as if he were face to face with them over a  bargaining table, while the Israeli reporters, just as often, argued back.    ""Do you think we lack humanity?"" he asked at one point, and then referred to a  common Yiddish term for non-Jews. ""Am I goy, and you're a person, or what? I am  a human being like you. I am not goy!""    Later, arguing with reporters over terrorism allegations, Arafat broke into a  smile and declared: ""Why should we go into these details? You are our cousins.  We know each other. We want peace.""    ""That's what we want,"" shot back one of the Israeli journalists.    ""But what kind of peace?"" Arafat went on. ""We don't want the peace of  destruction and occupation and death.""    The PLO chairman said he is ""always open to discussions which will bring us to  a complete and just peace,"" but he said it is up to Israel to respond formally  to Mubarak's 10 points before the PLO accepts or rejects them.      Israeli Cabinet Divided    The Israeli government has put off a final response in the wake of deep  divisions within the Cabinet, whose most hard-line members, including Prime  Minister Yitzhak Shamir, are strongly opposed to the Mubarak plan's provisions  for Israel to exchange land for peace, halt all Jewish settlements in the  occupied territories and allow Palestinian residents of East Jerusalem to vote  in any elections.    Israelis have also refused to negotiate with the PLO, a stand that has raised  questions about who would make up the Palestinian panel in any direct talks.  Would it be confined strictly to West Bank and Gaza residents, as the Israelis  would prefer, or would representatives of the vast Palestinian refugee  populations outside the territories be represented as well?    Mubarak has proposed including two Palestinians deported from the territories  as one way of compromising, but Arafat said outsiders should not be allowed to  dictate the makeup of the Palestinian panel.    ""Aren't I a representative of the Palestinians?"" he said. ""Am I the son of my  people, or the son of a crook? I'm not able to say I accept such-and-such a  person from your (Israeli) side.

0,FT941-15639 ,"FT941-15639 _AN-EANDNAA1FT 940114   FT  14 JAN 94 / Syria 'puts US links ahead of Israeli peace'      By JULIAN OZANNE      JERUSALEM   President Hafez al-Assad of Syria is seriously pursuing peace with Israel but will have to clarify his intentions concerning security arrangements and political ties if negotiations are to succeed, Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, said yesterday. In an interview ahead of Sunday's Geneva summit between Mr Assad and US President Bill Clinton, the 70-year-old veteran Israeli politician said the Syrian leader's priority was improving relations with the US and that peace with Israel was a by-product. The US keeps Syria on a blacklist of nations supporting international terrorism, obliging the US administration to vote against international loans to Damascus. 'Assad would like to make a comeback in the international arena with the opportunity to be helped financially, so his best address is Washington,' Mr Peres said. 'Assad, like everybody else who looks to the next century, knows we have come to the end of the hunting season.' Mr Peres's remarks reflect a widespread view among senior Israeli analysts that the summit will help unlock Syrian-Israeli peace talks, which for more than two years have been more like pre-negotiations. Syria is demanding the return of all the Golan Heights, the strategic plateau captured by Israel in the 1967 Six Day War. Israel has said it will withdraw 'on' the Golan, not 'from' the Golan, but has consistently refused to spell out its territorial offer until Damascus commits itself to a full peace with Israel, including open borders, trade and diplomatic relations, and comprehensive security guarantees. The normally optimistic Mr Peres, however, believes the negotiations with Syria will be complicated and could take some time because of the sensitive geographical, security and geo-political implications of peace. 'Assad must understand that as he demands territory from Israel he must be crystal clear about his intentions on security and relations,' Mr Peres said. 'Peace cannot be just a greeting card at Christmas.' Mr Peres stressed the importance of secret diplomacy and the involvement of the US and said he was unsure if agreement could be reached this year. 'We have to see first what Assad has in his pocket.' Mr Peres's caution is echoed by many other Israeli 'Syria watchers'. Mr Arye Shalev, a former general and now an analyst at the Jaffee Strategic Studies centre at Tel Aviv University, said peace with Syria would have to be deeper than the peace reached in 1979 with Egypt. 'It must be a real peace between people, rather than between leaders,' he said. Mr Shalev believes that, from a military point of view, Israel must retain a 2km-3km strip of the Heights to protect Israel's northern valleys from attack and defend the Jordan River headwaters, which drain into the Sea of Galilee and provide Israel with 30 per cent of its water needs. He says such a strip could be negotiated under a leaseback deal and is vital to prevent a repetition of an incident in 1965, when Syria tried to divert the Jordan's waters to a reservoir, or the 1967 and 1973 wars. Other Israeli analysts are less optimistic about negotiations, pointing to Syria's strategic relations with Iran, its involvement with Palestinian groups opposed to peace, and the nature of Mr Assad's regime, which has justified years of political oppression and economic stagnation on the need to be mobilised against the 'Zionist enemy'. However, despite the difficulties, most Israelis accept that a comprehensive Middle East peace will depend on progress with Syria. They believe Syria dictates policy to Lebanese officials negotiating peace with Israel and influences Jordan. On peace talks with the Palestinians, Mr Peres said the PLO had made a tactical error to argue over every point blocking implementation of the agreement for self rule in the Gaza Strip and Jericho. The Palestinians were losing time as all issues would be re-opened when talks began within months on extending self-rule to the rest of the West Bank and within two years on a permanent solution. 'The Palestinians should remember this is an interim within an interim and they can come back later and negotiate further,' he said.   Countries:-  ILZ  Israel, Middle East.

The reason that prompted the ban in the first place is  still there, the 1982 Israeli invasion of south Lebanon. The  combination of air raids, strafing, piracy, abductions, combing  of towns and villages and their devastation and depopulation is  an invasion in another guise. By lifting the arms embargo on  Israel, the United Kingdom is, in effect, rewarding the Israeli  aggressors and furnishing them with the means to bolster their  superiority and pursue their recklessness and acts of terror and  aggression.    Advancing an alibi for removing the embargo, the United  Kingdom cited ""encouraging developments in the peace process,  specifically the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho"", to  quote British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd. More  surprisingly, London has made lifting the arms ban on the Arabs  conditional on the bilateral talks moving forward. The party  that must take the blame for the failure of these talks to  advance is Israel itself. This is an example of the double  standard in UK policies -- one standard for Israel, another  against the Arabs.    By ending the ban on arms sales to Israel and making its  revocation regarding the Arabs conditional on the peace process  making headway, the British Government has set a serious  precedent in international relations. Britain has underscored  its blind bias toward Israel, its aggressive and terrorist  policies, and has stabbed the Arabs and their worthy causes.  The British Government defended its decision by citing  encouraging developments, sidestepping the facts and the  substance of the peace process. Just what are these  developments that prompted this decision? Do they include the  substitution of Israeli withdrawal as stipulated by UN Security  Council resolutions with the redeployment of forces provided for  in the self-rule agreement? Is the continuing existence of  Jewish settlements and consequently Israeli occupation an  encouraging development? Does Israel's responsibility for  security and political matters in the self-rule area or its  control over roads, crossings, and bridges also rank as  encouraging developments? Does the United Kingdom really rate  these as truly encouraging developments, or is it knowingly and  deliberately pursuing deceptive policies calculated to mislead  world opinion and liquidate the Palestinian people's rights?!    The United Kingdom is all too aware that the self-rule plan  does not meet the Palestinian people's aspirations. The United  Kingdom is equally aware that Israel continues to cling to  occupation, and thus is not eligible for any reward. Nor should  Israel's repressive machine be rewarded for its savagery and  terror. It is not right that the Israeli military should be  furnished with what it takes to pursue coercive and genocidal  programs.    It is worthwhile to make one thing abundantly clear:  Britain's pro-Israel stance is bound to further complicate  things in the region. It would have been more helpful if  Britain had acted to deter Israel's aggression and brought  pressure to bear in the interest of making it comply with UN  resolutions. The lifting of the arms embargo will only  exacerbate Israel's excesses and intransigence and its rejection  of the bases on which the peace process was launched. Britain  should have acted to end Israel's recklessness and arrogance,  and should have helped the cause of an even-handed and universal  peace settlement in the Middle East.     "
0,FT911-2679 ,"FT911-2679 _AN-BD2BCAAVFT 910429   FT  29 APR 91 / Open-ended talks rejected by Shamir      By JUDY MALTZ      JERUSALEM   MR Yitzhak Shamir, Israeli prime minister, has rejected a US proposal for an open-ended Middle East peace conference. This is likely to cause tension between the two countries. The US proposal was one of five points that Mr James Baker, US secretary of state, and Mr David Levy, Israeli foreign minister, had agreed during talks in Jerusalem on Friday. Mr Baker's latest Middle East tour ended abruptly later that day when he heard of his mother's death. He arrived in Israel after meeting leaders in Syria, Jordan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. Mr Shamir insists that the regional peace conference, which would be sponsored by the US and the Soviet Union, meet only once to lay the groundwork for direct bilateral negotiations between Israel and individual Arab states, and Israel and the Palestinians. The premier fears that, under the conference's auspices, Israel might be forced to give up Arab territories occupied since the 1967 Middle East war. 'We are opposed to that because, if there are subsequent sessions of the same meeting or conference, we'll never get to direct negotiations,' said Mr Shamir. As part of the agreement by Mr Baker and Mr Levy, the conference would reconvene occasionally to hear progress reports, but only with the support of every member, including Israel. News of the agreement led to a furore at the weekend among some of the more obdurate members of Mr Shamir's right-wing coalition, who threatened to resign if Israel agreed to the open-ended peace conference. Some of the key issues left unresolved at Mr Baker's abrupt departure from Jerusalem are: what role the UN and the European Community would play in the peace conference, and who would be in the Palestinian delegation to the talks. Following the weekly Israeli cabinet meeting yesterday, Mr Levy said his agreement with Mr Baker had been co-ordinated in advance with the prime minister. Mr Levy insinuated that Mr Shamir had got 'cold feet'. 'We will continue to act to advance the peace process and whoever cries of despair or gets cold feet cannot distort the picture - which is that Israel is achieving the most important parameters from the diplomatic point of view in a way that was not achieved in the past.' Mr Shamir tried to play down differences with the US, Israel's closest ally: 'I do not think we are heading towards a crisis. These negotiations are important, but I think it's too early to say that efforts in this direction have been frustrated.'

0,FT934-15848 ,"FT934-15848 _AN-DJJAIABOFT 931009   FT  09 OCT 93 / The Conservative Party Conference: Major stresses Tory commitment to Ulster      By ALISON SMITH and TIM COONE   MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday cemented his party's understanding with the Ulster unionists by re-emphasising the government's commitment to keeping Northern Ireland in the United Kingdom. His unequivocal statement came against a background of continuing uncertainty about the prospects for round-table talks on the future of Northern Ireland, which have been stalled since last November. Achieving the continuing support of the nine Ulster unionist MPs at Westminster would double the government's paper majority of just 17, leaving it much less vulnerable to backbench Tory rebellions on issues such as rail privatisation of the imposition of value added tax on domestic fuel. 'Northern Ireland is part of our democracy,' Mr Major said. 'We are not going to bargain away the people's democratic rights, in order to appease those who seek to rule by bullet or by bomb.' He was vigorously applauded as he insisted: 'No government which I lead will negotiate with those who perpetrate or those who support the use of violence.' Moderate nationalists are uneasy that the government may reward the Ulster unionists for their support on the critical Commons votes on the social chapter in July with changes such as a cross-party Westminster select committee on Northern Ireland. But the prospects of finding a solution also face other pressures. The hard-line Democratic Unionist party has ruled out further participation in the round-table talks process because of the initiative launched last month by Mr John Hume, the leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party, and Mr Gerry Adams, the leader of Sinn Fein. While the British government is doubtful that the Hume-Adams move will produce progress, Dublin seems more warmly disposed towards it. So long as the round-table talks have a chance of success, British government ministers do not intend to offer any concrete moves to the unionists. Instead, Mr Major hopes to keep the support of the party's MPs by emphasising the government's deep commitment to the Union - both he and Sir Norman Fowler pointedly referred to the Conservative and Unionist party - and contrasting that with Labour's policies. Yesterday he attacked Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, for allowing Mr Kevin McNamara, the Northern Ireland spokesman, 'to plan a united Ireland'. While Mr Ian Paisley, the DUP leader, responded yesterday by accusing Mr Major of 'trotting out all the usual Tory platitudes on Northern Ireland', the signs so far are that the Ulster unionists are more amenable to the government's approach. He said the DUP 'will be watching closely' the response of Mr Major and the Northern Ireland secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew to the Hume-Adams initiative which received a warm response in Dublin this week. Mr James Molyneaux, the Official Unionist party leader, told a fringe meeting this week that he saw no reason to end the life of the current parliament 'prematurely'. In Dublin, government reaction was low-key because no shift was detected away from Mr Major's previously stated policy positions.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

According to the cabinet of President Milosevic, the latest  developments in the former Yugoslav Republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina were discussed, as well as the positive  developments in the negotiations between Knin and Zagreb.    President Milosevic stressed that the bombardment of Serb  positions around Gorazde had shattered the delusion about the  international community's unbiased attitude to the crisis in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. The so-called Bosnia-Herzegovina army's  offensive has been going on for weeks before the eyes of the  entire world public whereas the United Nations has done nothing  to stop this offensive except for placid warnings. On the  contrary, Gorazde as a protected zone has been used as a  bridgehead for an offensive against the Serb positions. By  intervening with its air force, the United Nations has  undoubtedly taken part in the civil war on the side of the  Muslims, something that should undoubtedly be condemned as it  seriously dents the reputation of the United Nations in its  capacity as a mediator in the peace process. In President  Milosevic's view, in order to overcome the crisis that has  emerged it is necessary to settle for peace without prejudicing  a political solution instead of escalating military operations  and then -- in a situation marked by the absence of armed  conflicts -- finish political negotiations.    As far as the negotiations between Knin and Zagreb are  concerned -- during the course of which the Russian side played  an undoubtedly constructive role -- President Milosevic  expressed support for further negotiations while expressing  satisfaction with the successful implementation of the agreement  on the cessation of all hostilities between the army of the  republic of Serb Krajina and the Croatian Army. President  Milosevic also stressed that his personal contacts with  President Martic of Krajina had convinced him of the Krajina  leadership's constructive attitude and their sincere desire to  overcome the crisis through negotiations. However, the next  phase of negotiations that should follow the normalization of  economic relations raises in itself the problem of sanctions,  which at the moment poses the largest obstacle to the success of  the negotiations.    It is beyond doubt that all factors interested in peace and  in ending the crisis want the economic and traffic links between  Knin and Zagreb to be reestablished through negotiations, but  that cannot be achieved as long as the international sanctions  -- which make such links impossible -- are being applied against  one (Serb) side. This is why the international community and the  world public will have to face the choice: Either they support  the normalization of relations and peace, or -- by keeping the  sanctions -- they insist on disrupted relations and  confrontations. In that event, the sanctions would be the  greatest obstacle to the peace process and the normalization of  relations, President Milosevic stressed, expressing his  expectance that the forces of peace and cooperation will  overpower the protagonists of the war option and of prolonging  the crisis.    Today's talks between President Milosevic and Vitaliy  Churkin  were also attended by Yugoslav Foreign Minister Vladislav  Jovanovic and the Russian Ambassador to Belgrade Gennadiy Shikin.     "
0,FT921-12219 ,"FT921-12219 _AN-CA1BTADMFT 920128   FT  28 JAN 92 / UN envoy talks peace to Serbs in Croatia      By LAURA SILBER      BELGRADE   UNITED NATIONS special envoy Marrack Goulding met Serb leaders from Croatia yesterday in an attempt to persuade them to accept a UN peace plan which provides for the withdrawal of the federal army from Croatia after the deployment of a 10,000-strong multinational peacekeeping force. Serb leaders in Croatia oppose the plan because they say it fails to offer guarantees for Croatia's 600,000 Serbs. However, Mr Goulding, who is responsible for peacekeeping operations in the former Yugoslavia, said he was 'encouraged' after meeting Mr Goran Hadzic, a leader from the self-proclaimed Serbian region in eastern Slavonia. 'It is possible to say that a step forward has been made. . . We all have to do everything we can to convince the leaders of Krajina (the self-proclaimed Serbian republic in south Croatia) that it is a. . . plan which offers the possibility of establishing peace in Yugoslavia,' he said. Mr Goulding later met Mr Milan Babic, Krajina's president, who is a staunch opponent of the UN peace plan, which also envisages creation of UN-protected areas in Serb-populated regions, as well as the disarming of Serb and Croat irregulars. Mr Babic reaffirmed his opposition to the plan after meeting the envoy. 'The basic objection is it treats Krajina as a part of Croatia which will be placed under UN protection,' he said. 'This is naturally unacceptable from our side.' Serb insurgents, backed by the federal army, currently control a third of Croatia. President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia says he supports the UN plan but he appears to lack control over Serb leaders from Croatia. And in a sign of another shift in Serbian policy, Mr Ratko Markovic, a legal adviser to the republic's government, called for Serbia to 'reactivate' its independent status. Politika, a Belgrade daily and mouthpiece for the Serbian government, quoted Mr Markovic as saying: 'Serbia must elaborate its concept of an independent state and reaffirm its recognition which exists since 1878.' Mr Milosevic has insisted previously that Yugoslavia still exists despite the recognition of Croatia and Slovenia. Serbia did not apply for independent status or seek recognition. Mr Goulding is due to hold talks in Zagreb, the capital of Croatia, where the truce continues generally to hold.  The Financial Times   London Page 2  "

In response to 20 questions posed by Sinn Fein on the  Downing  Street peace declaration, the Northern Ireland Office issued a  statement saying the wishes of the greater number of people in  Ulster would be determined in a special poll.    The Government also drove home its message to the terrorists  to give up violence.    The statement bluntly told Sinn Fein to stop ""playing for  time"" and that democracy and violence cannot be reconciled.    The Government regards only one of the 20 questions put by  Sinn Fein as involving an explanation of the text of the Joint  Declaration.    In the declaration, the Government had said they would  ""uphold the democratic wishes of a greater number of the people  of Northern Ireland.""    Sinn Fein challenges the Government over the precise  definition of this phrase and asks how it would be measured in  practical terms.    The Government's comment is: ""The wish of a greater number  of  the people of Northern Ireland would be determined by a  numerical majority of those validly voting in a poll fairly and  explicitly organised for this purpose.    ""Provision for such a poll is made in Section 1 of the  Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973.""    In comments on the other questions, the Government  frequently  refers Sinn Fein to the text of the Joint Declaration, quoting  large chunks.    At the end, the Government poses its own question for Sinn  Fein, urging them to renounce violence in accordance with the  wishes of the people of Northern Ireland.    ""Democracy and violence cannot be reconciled. Sinn Fein must  choose. They know what they have to do if they are effectively  to fulfil their democratic mandate.    ""The democratic path leads to a meaningful role in the  political process: a process in which, as has been explained,  all issues are open for discussion and negotiation.    ""The alternative is isolation -- standing on the outside  while those committed to democracy shape the agreement,  structures and institutions that will determine the  relationships between the peoples of these islands.""    The Government says the majority of people in Ireland want  an  end to violence now.    ""Their wishes could not be clearer. There is no conceivable  justification for continuing to rob people of their lives, least  of all a call for a textual explanation of the Joint  Declaration,"" the statement says.    ""Sinn Fein asks what comes next. Certainly no further  playing for time,"" it warns.    Sinn Fein's questions were sent to the Northern Ireland  Office through the Irish Government.    Final agreement on the British Government's response was  reached at a Cabinet sub-committee meeting today.    Elsewhere in its commentary on the questions, the Government  makes clear that acceptance of the Joint Declaration is not a  precondition for entering the talks process.    ""What is required is a permanent end to the use of, or  support of, paramilitary violence,"" the statement says.    The British Government says it ""accepts the validity of all  electoral mandates, including that of Sinn Fein.""    It runs through what would happen if Sinn Fein and the IRA  renounced violence, saying exploratory talks would take place  after a three-month lapse.    These talks would explore the basis on which Sinn Fein would  be admitted to the peace process but without anticipating the  negotiations within that process.    There would also be an exchange of views on how Sinn Fein  would be able eventually to play the same part in the public  life of Northern Ireland as current constitutional parties.    The talks would examine the practical consequences of the  ending of violence.    The statement also makes clear: ""A lasting and general peace  would render military operations in support of the police no  longer necessary.""    Sinn Fein said tonight that they would examine the answers  they had received to see if they provided the clarification they  required.    Mitchel McLaughlin, Sinn Fein party chairman, said: ""Clarity  on the issues we have identified is in everyone's interest and  is crucial to the development of a viable peace process.    ""The response from the British Government can only assist in  the development of such a peace process if it provides direct,  unambiguous and comprehensive answers to the 20 questions we  have asked.""    He added: ""We will therefore be examining the British  response to see if it provides the clarification which we  require to make a properly informed assessment of the Downing  Street Declaration.""    Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams was today on the first of a  five-day trip to Italy. Sinn Fein said it would be faxing a  copy of the response to him.    It was thought unlikely he would make an off-the-cuff reply  before returning to Northern Ireland next week for consultations  with party leaders.    In its response the Government tells Sinn Fein that no  organisation has a veto over the peace process ""whether by  withdrawing from it or by refusing to renounce violence.""    It adds: ""An end to violence would open the way for a  comprehensive reassessment of existing provisions against  terrorism, many of which would become irrelevant and obsolete in  a climate of peace.""    Sinn Fein's questions probe a wide range of issues  surrounding the Joint Declaration, many of which the Government  responds to merely by quoting the document's text.    Only one of the 20 questions submitted to the Government by  Sinn Fein was genuinely seeking clarification of the Downing  Street declaration, Ulster Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew  indicated tonight.    He said: ""The rest of them are invitations to negotiate. We  are not going to negotiate. That is made very clear.""    Sir Patrick said on the BBC Six O'Clock News before the  Government had published the questions and its commentary on  them: ""We are facing something of great seriousness. We are  facing the continuance of violence for political purposes.""    He insisted that the future of Northern Ireland would be  decided ""by consent and democracy and not by violence or  coercion.""     "

On the  telephone line between Cairo and the U.S. capital, Washington,  we have Dr. Jawad al-'Anani, Jordanian information minister and  a member of the delegation accompanying King Husayn to  Washington. Minister Jawad al-'Anani, welcome to the Voice of  the Arabs.    [Al-'Anani] Good morning and thank you.    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Can you tell us about the results of His  Majesty King Husayn's visit to Washington and his meetings with  officials from the U.S. Administration?    [Al-'Anani] During his three-day visit, His Majesty King  Husayn met many American officials, foremost among them U.S.  President Bill Clinton. He also met U.S. Secretary of State  Christopher, the defense secretary, trade secretary, and  Congress members from both the House of Representatives and the  Senate. This visit was important because it followed the  agreement reached during the tripartite talks in Washington at  the start of this month on demarcating the Jordanian border  between Israel and Jordan or agreeing to form a committee to  demarcate the border and share water fairly. Jordan and Israel  also agreed on some big projects in the Jordan valley. The  visit was held to confirm these points.    His majesty the king and President Clinton agreed to form a  bilateral committee between the United States and Jordan to  discuss economic and political issues between their countries.  This committee will meet once every six months. Agreement was  reached within this framework for the United States to offer its  services to Jordan concerning rescheduling Jordanian foreign  debts, writing off part of them, and offering American aid and  aid from other countries that have strong relations with the  United States to help Jordan continue its economic reform  programs and restructure the Jordanian economy. Agreement was  also reached on expanding bilateral trade cooperation,  especially as the economic balance greatly favors the United  States.    I believe the visit was generally successful. It constituted  a beginning for cooperation based on mutual respect and  strengthening the Middle East peace process to serve the  interests of the region. It also constituted the beginning of  greater cooperation involving the countries taking part in the  peace process.    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Dr. Jawad al-'Anani, you have clarified that  there is a committee to study border demarcation between you and  Israel. This subject was discussed in Washington. Could we  pause at the issue of border demarcation between you and Israel  and present the Arab listener with a general picture of the  issue?    [Al-'Anani] You realize that the joint agenda signed between  Jordan and Israel on 14 September 1993--one day after the  agreement for the Israeli-Palestinian Declaration of Principles  was signed--contained a clear item stipulating that the truce  borders of 1922, which at the time separated the whole of  Palestine from Transjordan, are the reference for demarcating  the border now. Israel occupied some Jordanian territory after  1967. Jordan has constantly demanded this land back as part of  the solution and in accordance with Resolution 242, which  stipulates exchange of land or land for peace. We reached  agreement that border demarcation should be based on the mandate  treaty or agreement. This means that Jordan will retrieve its  land and that the current border with Israel is not  internationally recognized but is an armistice line.    Thus Jordan is the second country after the Arab Republic of  Egypt to have reached agreement with Israel on a final  demarcation of the border. A technical committee consisting of  representatives from both Jordan and Israel will meet at points  along the border to work on the disputed land to demarcate the  border, because you cannot demarcate a border from outside the  area in question.    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] There are those who believe that bilateral  agreements between the Arab countries and Israel are a departure  from Arab coordination. Is this really the case or should we  consider bilateral agreements the pillars for realizing a just  and comprehensive peace in the region?    [Al-'Anani] First, the process of coordination is not  frozen;  it is constantly moving and is very dynamic. You cannot say  that I will coordinate today and need not coordinate tomorrow.  This is not correct. Coordination is necessary under every  condition and at all times. Jordan has constantly advocated  coordination and cooperation with its brothers, the Arab parties  concerned in the negotiating process. Jordan has never failed  to attend any coordination meeting. Indeed Jordan has always  called for such meetings. You remember that the cordon states  ministers meetings--the four negotiating countries including  Egypt--used to meet periodically before and after each round of  talks to define, study, and coordinate stances.    During these meetings it became clear that the Arab  parties--the Arab foreign ministers who used to meet--agreed  that the concept of comprehensive peace does not mean that one  side cannot move ahead to achieve things on any track. Each  track has its own specifications and requirements, which might  not be 100 percent the same as the requirements for the other  tracks. But the important point is that in the final analysis  we reach a comprehensive peace agreement on every front, because  deficiency in the peace process on any track will not see this  peace be a permanent one. It will make it a fragile peace ready  to collapse anytime. This is what we agreed on with the U.S.  side. President Clinton approved this process. I do not  believe Arab coordination should contend that if one side  achieves something on its track that would mean it would have  violated the coordination. We believe coordination becomes  stronger with such an achievement, which then becomes the  motivation and objective leading the other tracks to achieve  similar results.    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Dr. Jawad al-'Anani, Egypt welcomed this  progress on the Jordanian track. Is there any specific idea on  an Egyptian role in the coming stage?    [Al-'Anani] Of course Egypt played a big role in the peace  process. To a great extent it participates in the peace process  on the level of Arab coordination and mediation among some Arab  sides and the conference cosponsors. Egypt even played an  important role in mediating between the Palestinian side and  Israel. And Egypt has an international, African, and Arab role,  which cannot be ignored, because of the importance of this Arab  country and its strategic position and significance in political  and population terms inside the Arab world. We in Jordan  greatly welcome the statements by Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa and  other Egyptian officials who expressed their joy at this  achievement. We believe such a positive spirit should prevail  in the Arab world so that relations may continue, based on  encouragement and support rather than hastening to criticize  situations before knowing the full details. This would squander  the Arab potential required by the peace process.    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Dr. Jawad al-'Anani, we thank you very much  and welcome you on the phone line between Cairo and Washington  on the Voice of the Arabs.    [Al-'Anani] I would like to thank you for being very quick  to  contact the parties and in learning the facts. I am very happy  to talk to you and wish you and the Arab Egyptian people much  success and progress with God's help.     "
0,FT943-11390 ,"FT943-11390 _AN-EG4ARACCFT 940730   FT  30 JUL 94 / Last tango in the Middle East: A look at Syria's role in the peace process      By MARK NICHOLSON   After the pomp and publicity of the White House garden ceremony on Monday, when King Hussein of Jordan and Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, signed an end to a 46-year-old state of war on a sunlit table, the focus of the peace process returns to the Middle East. This time it disappears behind the firmly closed doors of the presidential palace high on the hills overlooking Damascus. Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, is expected in Syria again as early as next week, just over a fortnight after his last round of talks with President Hafez al-Assad, the Syrian leader. The visit is a clear attempt to use the fresh momentum of this week's signing to push along the Syrian track of the three-year-old Middle East peace process, which has proved the slowest. Mr Christopher will be hoping Mr Assad has read the signals from the White House. The Syrian leader, who is seeking closer ties with the US and the removal of his country from America's list of state sponsors of terrorism, will have seen the warmth of the reception for King Hussein, who appeared to have erased the damage done to US-Jordanian relations during the Gulf war. He will have seen that peace brings material rewards - in Jordan's case, US promises of military aid and debt relief worth Dollars 700m. Mr Christopher might additionally hope that Syria will feel left behind in the peace process, and that Mr Assad might quicken his step in the negotiations. For as Mr Shimon Peres, Israel's foreign minister, said yesterday that the sides still remained far apart: 'Right now it's not a tango, it's not a dance between the two (parties).' Mr Assad will have digested these developments, though close diplomatic and academic observers doubt whether he is susceptible to pressure on the basis that he is being 'left behind'. One senior western diplomat suggests that a man famous for sitting ramrod-straight for hours during diplomatic meetings to convey the impression of implacable strength and resolution would not give any sign of being hurried, even if he felt it. In any case, he adds: 'Assad's patience is legendary, and if Syria has already waited 27 years to get back the Golan Heights, then why not wait a few more if that's what it takes to get the right deal?' The area between Israel and Syria, which Israel has occupied since the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, forms the heart of the antagonism between the two countries. Further, while King Hussein accelerated his talks with the Israelis partly to prevent the risk that his kingdom might be marginalised in the peace process, Mr Assad harbours no such worries. He knows that both Israel and the US consider Syria the crucial component in any overarching regional peace deal. The other headline Middle Eastern events of the past week amply suggest the reasons why - and why the Israeli-Syrian track of the talks is proving the most complex and slowest to show progress. The two bombings against Jewish targets in London this week, which left 19 wounded, and the car bomb which killed 96 in an anti-Jewish raid in Buenos Aires on July 18, were brutal reminders that deadly and efficient opponents both of Israel and of the peace negotiations remain at large. Whether the Lebanese militant Islamic group Hizbollah was behind some or all of the attacks, or whether the plots were ultimately hatched in the Iranian capital, Tehran, as Israel charges, is still to be discovered. There is reason to suspect the Iranian-backed Hizbollah, despite its denials of involvement in any of these recent attacks. It claimed responsibility for bombing Jewish targets in Argentina in 1992. Moreover, it swore only last month that it would use its own 'long arms' to exact revenge for an Israeli attack on a Hizbollah training camp deep in the Bekaa Valley in east Lebanon, in which 30 of its fighters were killed. As long as Iran remains hostile to any peace with Israel and capable at least of inspiring acts of anti-Jewish terror, there is little Israel or the US can do to banish the threat of such outrages altogether. But the possibility of neutralising, or at least containing, such threats under the present peace process lies largely in Mr Assad's hands. For one thing, Mr Assad has shown that he can effectively contain Hizbollah's threat to Israel from south Lebanon. While the group is supported by Iran, its main camps in Lebanon operate largely in Syrian-held areas of the Bekaa Valley and its arms must pass through Damascus. Last year, when Israel pounded south Lebanon for a week in retaliation for Hizbollah rocket attacks into northern Israel, Mr Assad's intervention secured a 'gentleman's agreement' that such attacks would cease. That agreement has essentially held. While Israeli troops remain inside their self-declared 15km-deep 'security zone' in south Lebanon, neither Syria nor the Lebanese government will act to deprive Hizbollah of arms, which the group says it is using against an occupying force. But few in Damascus or Beirut doubt that if and when an Israeli withdrawal is agreed under an eventual regional peace plan, Lebanese troops, backed by the 35,000 Syrian troops in the country, will disarm and close down Hizbollah as a violent threat to Israel. Moreover, it is widely thought that Mr Assad would be able to exert his authority over Hizbollah without damaging his friendly relations with Iran. The Iranians have few friends among Arab states and are antithetical towards making peace with Israel. 'The Iranians have already said that, if Syria made peace, Iran would continue to treat it differently from the other Arab states such as Egypt,' says Mr Shahram Chubin, an Iran analyst at the Institute of International Studies in Geneva. Several European diplomats in Damascus believe Syria has already reached an understanding with Iran that Tehran would cease to provide military support for Hizbollah in the event of a Syrian-Israeli peace. Syria's potential role as an intermediary and interlocutor with Iran is almost certainly something Mr Assad hopes the US will acknowledge and, perhaps, reward. His influence over Hizbollah is a bargaining card that Mr Assad is playing cannily as he negotiates with the Israelis for their withdrawal from the Golan Heights. In return, Israel is seeking a Syrian commitment to a 'full' peace of open borders, trade and normalised diplomatic relations. Finding a formula to resolve the impasse over a 'full' Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights in exchange for a 'full' Syrian peace with Israel is in itself a considerable diplomatic challenge. The return of the Golan is paramount for Mr Assad. But a solution to this problem alone is unlikely to satisfy him if it does not also bring a wider acknowledgement of Syria's importance as a regional power. His price for containing Hizbollah in any peace is likely to be some US-Israeli recognition of continued Syrian influence in Lebanon. The detailed progress of negotiations between Syria and Israel is difficult to interpret while both sides remain silent. But Mr Christopher's return to Damascus indicates that the US believes Mr Assad is prepared to move the talks forward. For Mr Assad to receive him suggests Mr Christopher is not arriving empty-handed. US promises of improved relations and material aid, though, are unlikely to bring Mr Assad to the White House lawns with Mr Rabin. According to one western ambassador: 'Assad would never be willing to give up certain political principles just to get some money.'   Countries:-  SYZ  Syria, Middle East.

""In Nicaragua, nobody asks any more how many died in the latest battle,"" Arias  said. ""They ask how the election campaign is going.""    As enemies in Nicaragua turn from bullets to ballots, the rightist government  and Marxist rebels of El Salvador have launched their own effort to end Latin  America's most intense conflict, a 10-year war that has cost an estimated  70,000 lives.    But the peculiarities of the Salvadoran war make it more intractable than the  fading Nicaraguan war between the Sandinista government and U.S.-backed  Contras.    The Salvadoran government and the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front  agreed Sept. 15 in Mexico City to try to make peace ""by political means in the  shortest time possible"" through monthly negotiations.    Their first round of substantive talks, however, reached an impasse here  Wednesday. In three days, they agreed on nothing but to meet again in November.    In some ways, the Salvadoran talks mirror those the Sandinistas and Contras  held in late 1987 and early 1988. While battle fatigue pushed the contenders to  the table, diplomacy has worked against the guerrilla side in both countries.    Poles apart in ideology, the FMLN rebels and the Contras ended up in the same  bind -- both facing a government bolstered by the 1987 Central American peace  agreement that aims to end rebel insurgencies.    Within the limits of that five-nation accord, which brought Arias a Nobel Peace  Prize, both rebel groups were obliged to recognize a regime they had fought to  overthrow and to negotiate for little more than equal rights in a freer  political system.    In Nicaragua, peace talks broke down in June, 1988, but not before producing an  informal truce that still holds. With the Contras weakened by a cutoff of U.S.  military aid, the Sandinistas drove most of them into Honduras, then won a  regional pact for the rebels' disarmament in exchange for early elections, set  for Feb. 25.    Nobody expects a quick settlement in El Salvador. But Arias and other optimists  dare to predict that the ebbing tide of East-West conflict makes one  inevitable.    Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani has proposed an immediate cease-fire;  just as the Contras reacted to a similar Sandinista offer two years ago, the  FMLN rejects it.    The guerrillas say Cristiani is maneuvering politically to undermine them  without making real concessions. As a prelude to a cease-fire, they demand  fundamental reform of the constitution, the political system, the judiciary and  the military.    A Costa Rican official involved in both peace efforts said that sooner or later  the FMLN will have to accept a cease-fire with few conditions, at least as a  basis for further talks.

""In Nicaragua, nobody asks any more how many died in the latest battle,"" Arias  said. ""They ask how the election campaign is going.""    As enemies in Nicaragua turn from bullets to ballots, the rightist government  and Marxist rebels of El Salvador have launched their own effort to end Latin  America's most intense conflict, a 10-year war that has cost an estimated  70,000 lives.    But the peculiarities of the Salvadoran war make it more intractable than the  fading Nicaraguan war between the Sandinista government and U.S.-backed  Contras.    The Salvadoran government and the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front  agreed Sept. 15 in Mexico City to try to make peace ""by political means in the  shortest time possible"" through monthly negotiations.    Their first round of substantive talks, however, reached an impasse here  Wednesday. In three days, they agreed on nothing but to meet again in November.    In some ways, the Salvadoran talks mirror those the Sandinistas and Contras  held in late 1987 and early 1988. While battle fatigue pushed the contenders to  the table, diplomacy has worked against the guerrilla side in both countries.    Poles apart in ideology, the FMLN rebels and the Contras ended up in the same  bind -- both facing a government bolstered by the 1987 Central American peace  agreement that aims to end rebel insurgencies.    Within the limits of that five-nation accord, which brought Arias a Nobel Peace  Prize, both rebel groups were obliged to recognize a regime they had fought to  overthrow and to negotiate for little more than equal rights in a freer  political system.    In Nicaragua, peace talks broke down in June, 1988, but not before producing an  informal truce that still holds. With the Contras weakened by a cutoff of U.S.  military aid, the Sandinistas drove most of them into Honduras, then won a  regional pact for the rebels' disarmament in exchange for early elections, set  for Feb. 25.    Nobody expects a quick settlement in El Salvador. But Arias and other optimists  dare to predict that the ebbing tide of East-West conflict makes one  inevitable.    Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani has proposed an immediate cease-fire;  just as the Contras reacted to a similar Sandinista offer two years ago, the  FMLN rejects it.    The guerrillas say Cristiani is maneuvering politically to undermine them  without making real concessions. As a prelude to a cease-fire, they demand  fundamental reform of the constitution, the political system, the judiciary and  the military.    A Costa Rican official involved in both peace efforts said that sooner or later  the FMLN will have to accept a cease-fire with few conditions, at least as a  basis for further talks.    ""If not, they risk losing their credibility,"" he said. Recalling that the  Contras ""ceased to be a legitimate force"" after breaking off their talks last  year, he added that ""the same thing could happen to the FMLN.""

We think that any  party, which will try to go very fast, will have to wait for the  others because at the end this peace cannot be between Israel  and only one party.

Foreign minister Shimon Peres suggested closed-door talks were planned with Syria but refused to elaborate. 'Considering that these are secret negotiations, you cannot expect me to give all the details,' he said. Syria officially announced that a meeting between the Syrian and Israeli ambassadors to the US was due to be held in Washington yesterday. The official Syrian news agency Sana said Syrian and Israeli military officials would attend the talks due to be held at the State Department under the auspices and participation of the US. Channel Two TV said LtGen Ehud Barak, the Israeli military chief of staff, was in Washington for the talks. The army refused to comment. The peace talks appear still stuck over the Golan Heights captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed in 1981. Syria wants Israel to agree to a full withdrawal before discussing the terms of peace, while Israel is proposing a limited withdrawal followed by a testing period during which the final withdrawal line would be negotiated.

In this regard,  I believe that despite the great importance that President  Clinton attaches to domestic affairs in his country, he has  given special attention as a full partner and honest broker in  order to help the parties achieve a comprehensive peace that  concerns not only the people of the region, but all world  nations.    Today's meeting between me and President Clinton crowned a  series of correspondences and telephone calls between us during  the last year. I hope that our meeting today will contribute to  achieving the aspirations of the region's peoples that this new  year be a year for the establishment of a just and comprehensive  peace that puts an end to the tragedies of violence and wars  from which these peoples have been suffering for several decades.    During our meeting, I had the opportunity to emphasize to  President Clinton Syria's firm commitment to the bases and  principles of the peace process and our strong faith that peace  cannot be real and lasting unless it its comprehensive and based  on the principles of international legitimacy and justice. This  means serious work for a just solution on all tracks. Current  and historical evidence proves that separate peace deals and  partial solutions cannot secure a real peace in the region. In  this regard, I would like to express my satisfaction that  President Clinton is personally committed to the objective of a  comprehensive peace. Accordingly, we agreed to work together in  order to render successful the efforts aimed at putting an end  to the Arab-Israeli conflict and reach a comprehensive and real  peace that enables the region's peoples to concentrate on their  development, progress, and prosperity.    This meeting also gave us the opportunity to exchange views  on a number of issues, including those related to bilateral  relations, and we agreed that the noble objective we are working  for together requires a qualitative step toward better  relations. We also discussed issues related to the regional  situation and all that would contribute to security and  stability in the Middle East.    Syria seeks a just and comprehensive peace with Israel as a  strategic option that guarantees Arab rights, terminates the  Israeli occupation, and enables all the region's peoples to live  in peace, safety, and dignity. We fought honorably, negotiate  honorably, and make peace honorably. We want an honorable peace  for our people and for hundreds of thousands of those who  sacrificed their lives in defense of the homeland and its  rights. There is almost no house in Syria that has not lost a  martyr in defense of the homeland, nation, and Arab rights. For  the sake of all those and for the sake of their sons and  families, we want the peace of the brave, a real peace that  thrives, continues, guarantees the interests of all, and gives  rights to their owners. If the leaders of Israel have enough  courage to respond to such a peace, a new era of security and  stability and normal peaceful relations among all will emerge in  the region. Thank you. [applause]    [Clinton] In pursuit of that priority I have always viewed  Syria's involvement as critical. That is why from the outset of  our administration, I have engaged President al-Asad in a  regular correspondence by telephone and letter, and why I am now  pleased to have had this opportunity to hear personally  President al-Asad's views about how best to make this a year of  [words indistinct] to produce real peace. The accord between  Israel and the PLO marks a first step to lay the groundwork for  a solution to the Palestinian problem. I have said that I  believe Syria to be the key and that its role is critical for  achieving a true and lasting peace between Israel and its  neighbors. As you have heard, President al-Asad shares with me  the goal of achieving a comprehensive peace with Israel and  peaceful relations between the neighbors. Israel and Syria will  have to make crucial decisions to achieve peace. Hence,  al-Asad's call for a peace of the brave. You have heard him say  that now, and I support this. Today we worked together to bring  the peace talks that began in Madrid two years ago to a  successful conclusion. There are important problems that need  to be solved. There are problems related to withdrawal, peace,  and security. We will try to solve the issues that are  connected with peace, withdrawal, and security. But I am  confident that we have laid the foundations for real progress.  The heads of delegations will begin again talks in Washington  next week. We also discussed the state of relations between the  United States and Syria and agreed on the desirability of  improving them. This requires honestly addressing the problems  in our relationship. Accordingly, we have instructed the  secretary of state and the Syrian foreign minister to establish  a mechanism to address these issues in detail and openly. For  too long, the Middle East has been denied the benefits of peace,  and yet it is within our power to create the conditions that  will enable Israeli and Arab -- Muslim, Christian, and Jew -- to  live together in peace. Today's meeting was an important step  for fulfilling that vision. We have a lot of work to do, but we  are closer to our goal. Thank you. [applause]    [Reporter, in English] Mr. President: Do you feel that you  have a firm commitment from President al-Asad to normalize  relations with Israel, and by that I mean open borders, free  trade, and diplomatic relations?    [Clinton] The short answer is yes. I believe that President  al-Asad has made a clear, forthright and very important  statement on normal, peaceful relations now. In order to  achieve those relations, a peace agreement has to be negotiated  in good faith and carried out. But this is an important  statement, the first time that there has been a clear expression  that there will be a possibility of that sort of relationship.    [Reporter, in Arabic] Mr. President: All the separate  agreements have proved a failure, the most notable examples  being the 17 May agreement in Lebanon and the Gaza-Jericho  accord. UN resolutions on Iraq have been applied firmly. To  date, Resolution 425 on Lebanon remains unenforced. When will  we see a commitment to UN Resolutions, including 425?    [Clinton] First of all, as to the specifics of the  implementation, that will be part of the process of negotiation.  But let me answer the first, and more important question, I  think. I think all the parties in this process recognize that it  cannot succeed unless all the tracks are brought to a successful  conclusion. That is, I think President al-Asad was very  eloquent in our meeting today about the question of Lebanon, and  Jordan, for that matter, in saying that even Syria may feel  fully satisfied with its differences with Israel if they could  be worked out, there would still have to be a comprehensive  peace in which the issues affecting Lebanon, the issues  affecting Jordan, and the issues relating to the PLO would, in  addition to the Syrian issues, would all be resolved. We are all  committed to that.    [Reporter, in English] Mr. al-Asad. President Clinton is  the fifth, the fourth American President you're meeting now. Do  you think you can afford to wait for a fifth one or have you  decided to sign the peace now?    [Al-Asad] Yes. We are ready to sign peace now.    [Reporter, in English] President Clinton. Beyond the broad  assurances that you and President al-Asad have spoken of here  about the willingness to seek peace and to negotiate it. Do you  have, Sir, as a result of these meetings, any of the kinds of  specific detailed concessions or a sense of willingness to make  concessions that might make a successful negotiation possible?  And if so, can you tell us in what areas they are?    [Clinton] Well, as you know, I have a very strong conviction  that the specifics of this agreement will have to be negotiated  by the parties themselves. And even though I have in mind  several things, I think that it is very important that those of  us who are trying to facilitate these discussions not discuss  the details of them. The parties are going to have to work that  out.    Let me say that an indication has been given here by the  very  important statement that President al-Asad has already made,  stating clearly that it is time to end the conflict with Israel,  make peace with Israel, that peace can be, should lead to normal  and peaceful relations. I would hope that this would provoke a  positive response in Israel and that the parties would get  together and work these details out. That is not for the United  States to dictate.    [Reporter, in Arabic] President Clinton. Despite the peace  talks since the Madrid conference, Israel continues to build  settlements in the occupied Arab territories which, according to  all international standards, are considered illegitimate and a  violation of UN resolutions. Moreover, at a time when Syria  signed the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and has demanded  over the years that the Middle East be a region free of weapons  of mass destruction--nuclear, chemical, and biological  weapons--Israel still refuses to sign the nuclear  Non-Proliferation Treaty and continues to stockpile weapons.  Mr. President, do you not think that these Israeli stands and  practices contradict the concept of peace for which you are  working? Thank you.    [Clinton] First, sir, I believe the question of settlements  in disputed areas is one of the things that clearly will have to  be resolved in connection with this peace process consistent  with United Nations resolutions and the concept of territory for  peace. I said that in my opening statement. I expect that to  work, to be worked through.    Secondly, on the question of weapons, I believe the best  chance we have to stop the spread of weapons of mass  destruction, that includes not only nuclear but also biological  and chemical weapons, and indeed to slow the sophisticated  conventional arms race in the Middle East is to finish this  peace process successfully. I think that is, as a practical  matter, the only way to do it. And we're going to, the United  States will work as hard as we can toward that objective.    [Reporter, in English] President al-Asad: Are you clearly  stating unequivocally today that in exchange for a full Israeli  withdrawal from the Golan Heights, Syria would be prepared to  establish normal diplomatic relations with Israel, including  open borders, including tourism, the same kind of peace treaty  that Israel established with Egypt?    [Al-Asad] All of us, foremost the United States and  President Clinton, are trying to make peace comprehensive in  order to make it lasting and just. Within this framework, we  are trying to achieve a real peace that will secure rights for  everyone and secure a stable life for everyone. In such a  solution, all the region's peoples, as well as all the world's  nations, have an interest. President Clinton and I were in  agreement regarding our views. We will respond to peace  requirements. This matter, as you know, is a subject to be  tackled at the negotiating table, not during this conference.    [Reporter, in Arabic] This question is posed to President  Clinton: The United States has proposed itself as a full  partner and an honest broker. Syria welcomed this and  cooperated with this for the sake of a peace process that is of  concern to the entire world. Despite this, the United States  still deals with Syria in a way which is different from the way  it deals with Israel, particularly in the field of financial and  military aid. What is your explanation of this? Thank you.    [Clinton] [words indistinct] ... with Syria over a number of  issues, including our differences over questions relating to  certain groups, PKK [Kurdish Workers Party], Hizballah, the  Jibril group [Popular Front for the Liberation of  Palestine-General Command], others, other issues. We talked  about these differences for about an hour today without any view  toward trying to resolve them. We agreed on two things, and I  think this is very important. One is that if we can maintain  one another's confidence working toward a peaceful solution in  the Middle East, that that would do a great deal for our  bilateral relations and for a better future. And the second is  that we needed to have a process that had integrity, established  by the secretary of state and the Syrian foreign minister. That  would go beyond public exchanges to a very specific delineation  of the differences between us and an honest effort to resolve  them or to make progress on them. So, sir, I think the best  answer to your question is that we think that the progress  perhaps can be made. We've set up a mechanism to deal honestly  with the differences between us, and we believe maintaining each  other's confidence by a good-faith effort in the Middle East  peace process is the most important thing we can do at this  moment in our history.    [Reporter, in English] Mr. President: If the subject is so  close to your heart, but you evaded answering whether you  thought that Israel could sign a Non-Proliferation Treaty, my  real question is: Did you discuss and set a timetable for  Israeli and Syrian troops to come out of Lebanon?    [Clinton] We did not have any discussions today about the  details of any face of the Middle East peace process because the  other parties are not here present, and it would not have been  an appropriate thing to do.    [Reporter, in Arabic] [words indistinct]    [Clinton, interrupting] Excuse me, I got one of those  helpful little hands from one of my staff members down here. I  apologize to interrupt you. I want to be perfectly forthright  because I don't want to leave a false impression that might be  adversely interpreted against President al-Asad. We did discuss  the importance of having the Lebanese peace process go on  parallel to the Israeli-Syrian process. I reaffirm my support  for the al-Ta'if accord, and President al-Asad agrees that there  should be a successful conclusion of a peace process which left  Lebanon free and independent as a nation. So, there was no  difference between us on the objective. And I didn't want  anything I said to be read unfairly against him on that score.  We actually, I think, reached complete meeting of the mind.    [Reporter, in English] In my interview with you, on 13  September at the White House, you called for a bigger Syrian  role in the peace process, and you called personally on His  Excellency President al-Asad to play a personal role in forging  ahead a breakthrough in the peace process. Now that you've met  President al-Asad face to face for the first time, what is your  impression about President al-Asad? And how do you view his  personal role in achieving that breakthrough?    [Clinton] Well, first of all, you know I had heard a lot  about President al-Asad's legendary stamina in these meetings.  [laughter] And when we called a break four hours and 20 minutes  into our meeting, I can tell you that his reputation does not  exceed the reality. He deserves every bit of it. Secondly, we  had the opportunity, because we did talk for so long, we had the  opportunity to exchange not only our views about the issues in  play at present but also I had the opportunity to learn  President al-Asad's perspective over a period exceeding 20 years  now on some of these issues. And it reinforced my belief, as  expressed in September, that there would be no comprehensive  peace in the Middle East unless he were willing to take a  leadership role, and that he has decided to take the risks that  all these leaders, if they really want peace, are going to have  to take. And so, I guess, I would have to say that that is the  most important thing to me. The thing that was most impressive,  I believe, that he is committed to trying to work through this  as quickly as possible, and I think others will see that  commitment and will respond in an appropriate way.    [Reporter, in Arabic] President Clinton, if peace is an  international need, and the U.S. Administration is seriously  seeking to achieve it, providing that it is also a U.S.,  Israeli, and Syrian need, then why does the peace process  stumble every now and then? How will the U.S. Administration,  taking into consideration that it is the most important  cosponsor, tackle the obstacles that might emerge on the road in  the future? Thank you.    [Clinton] Of course, it stumbles every now and then because  it's difficult to do. If it were easy to do, it would have been  done before. The parties have been at odds with each other for  a long time, there was a lot of mistrust to overcome, there are  a lot of details to be worked out. And, I think whenever there  is any ambiguity at all, or uncertainty, then that is likely to  lead to other problems down the road. So, there are lots of  reasons why it happens. What the United States is trying to do  is to take advantage of what I think is an appropriate moment in  history, where you have leaders committed to getting this  done--leaders who understand that the interests of their people  will be served over the long run by comprehensive peace. And so  what we can do, I think, is to try to keep the process going,  keep the trust level up among the parties, try to be an honest  broker and work through the problems, and when these  difficulties do arise, as they have as you implied in the  aftermath of the PLO-Israel accord, to try to help and work  through them as quickly as possible and get things back on track.    [Reporter, in English] Thank you.    [Clinton] Thank you very much.     "
0,FT934-4357 ,"FT934-4357 _AN-DLEAMAACFT 931204   FT  04 DEC 93 / Dublin summit revives search for peace plan: Major and Reynolds aim for joint declaration on Ulster after 'frank talks'      By PHILIP STEPHENS      DUBLIN   The British and Irish prime ministers last night revived their stalled Northern Ireland peace initiative with a plan for a joint declaration of principles designed to persuade the IRA to halt its campaign of violence. Nevertheless, intense talks between Mr John Major and Mr Albert Reynolds at the Dublin summit still left the two governments without a detailed formula to bridge the gap between the aspirations of Irish nationalists and Britain's guarantee to Ulster Unionists of a veto over a united Ireland. After what both leaders admitted had been a 'frank' exchange over Britain's contacts this year with Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, they acknowledged that it might eventually prove impossible to bridge differences over the future of the province. 'We cannot be certain we will resolve those difficulties,' Mr Major said. He and Mr Reynolds discussed different texts in detail, and said they remained committed to further talks. That raised hopes that a joint statement could be agreed when they meet in Brussels next week or during a session in London pencilled in before Christmas. Balancing the two leaders' caution, Mr Reynolds said: 'We got through quite a lot of very serious work, very productive work.' The Irish prime minister insisted during the talks that agreement on the joint declaration was essential to secure an end to violence by the IRA and set the stage for detailed talks with the political parties in Northern Ireland. He said afterwards: 'At the end of the day, peace is paramount.' It is understood that the draft of the declaration includes a renewed offer to Sinn Fein of a place in negotiations in return for an end to terrorism. Mr Major also refused to dismiss the possibility of further bilateral contacts with Republican leaders. But he insisted that the IRA could not dictate the terms of any agreement. 'There is no question of bargaining for an end to violence,' he said. Earlier Mr Major had faced sharp criticism from Mr Reynolds over the London government's covert contacts with Sinn Fein for much of this year. The Irish leader said their sharp exchanges on the issue had 'cleared the air' and paved the way for further negotiations. At the heart of the day-long talks was an attempt, so far unsuccessful, to find language that would recognise both the right of the Irish people to determine their own future and the insistence of the Ulster Unionists that nothing should be done to undercut Northern Ireland's place in the United Kingdom. Mr Reynolds repeated his pledge that the Republic accepted that the consent of the Unionist majority was essential to any change in the constitutional status of the province. He confirmed that he wanted referendums in both the north and south of Ireland to endorse any agreement reached by the two governments. Mr Major will now seek to reassure Unionist leaders that he has not agreed anything to undermine Ulster's place in the UK. Mr Reynolds appeared determined to maintain the pressure on Mr Major to agree language that would give the IRA an excuse to call a permanent end to violence. The Irish leader believes that such a cessation could transform the atmosphere in both north and south and pave the way for a durable political settlement.

0,FT923-1868 ,"FT923-1868 _AN-CIUDDACHFT 920921   FT  21 SEP 92 / Sudan ceasefire 'very soon': Lonrho chief optimistic after a week of shuttle diplomacy      By JULIAN OZANNE      NAIROBI   A CEASEFIRE in Sudan's civil war will be negotiated 'very soon', Mr Tiny Rowland, chief executive of the international conglomerate Lonrho, said yesterday. Mr Rowland, in an interview, described a hectic week of shuttle diplomacy, which has taken him from a further round of Mozambique peace talks in Botswana to southern Sudan for lunch with rebel leader John Garang. Mr Rowland, whose company's African interests include investments in Sudan and Mozambique, was speaking in Nairobi before flying to Khartoum for a private meeting with President Omar Hassan Ahmed el Bashir, the country's military leader. Mr Rowland disclosed that he and Mr Mark Too, deputy chairman of Lonrho East Africa, flew into southern Sudan last Thursday for talks with Mr Garang, leader of the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA). He had left with a message from Mr Garang to President Bashir, and expected his efforts to result in the first face to face meeting between the two sides. This would 'very soon' lead to a ceasefire in the conflict which has cost hundreds of thousands of lives: 'I have been at this for eight years and this one is going to be settled soon,' said Mr Rowland. He and Mr Too plan to return from Khartoum to Nairobi today and fly back into southern Sudan for further talks with Mr Garang and Mr Lam Akol, the leader of a second rebel faction. Mr Rowland, who has assumed the mantle of broker in two of Africa's most devastating civil wars, was also optimistic about last month's peace agreement between the Mozambique government and Renamo rebel movement. It was 'absolutely solid', he said. The first stage of the peace accord was signed at a ceremony in Rome last month, attended by Mr Rowland. He has continued to act behind the scenes, and his arrival in Nairobi on Saturday night followed his participation at a meeting between Mozambique's President Joaquim Chissano and Renamo leader Alfonso Dhlakama in Gaborone, capital of Botswana. The meeting has resolved the last remaining obstacles to a ceasefire - the formation of a national army composed of both Renamo and government troops, and the role of the intelligence service during the transition to multi-party elections next year. Mr Vincent Zacarias Uluzu, general secretary of Renamo, said the two sides agreed to restructure the intelligence service and police force. Mr Rowland said a formal ceasefire agreement would be signed on October 1 in either Gaborone or Harare.  The Financial Times   London Page 6  "

Mr Gad Ben Ari, Mr Rabin's spokesman, said Egypt's ambassador in Israel had requested the meeting a few days ago. But he added: 'In terms of exact dates and in terms of location, nothing is set.' Mr Mubarak, the key intermediary in efforts to revive the stalled peace talks, meets President Bill Clinton tomorrow. Mr Mubarak said last week he would report the substance of his meeting to Mr Rabin on his return. The Egyptian leader has met both President Hafez al-Assad of Syria and Mr Yassir Arafat, the Palestine Liberation Organisation chairman, in the run-up to his trip to the US. The PLO is meeting this week in Tunis to discuss possible measures to resolve the crisis over the Israeli mass deportation of Palestinians in December which has blocked the resumption of peace talks. The Palestinians have said they will not decide whether to attend the next round of talks, scheduled for April 20, until after Mr Mubarak's return from Washington.

The platform stresses that the RS is asking the  international  community -- before any peace talks take place -- to meet its  obligations toward Serbs regarding the suspension, i.e.,  abolition of sanctions.    The RS sees the Croat-Muslim Federation agreement and the  agreement on a confederation with Croatia as the realization of  the rights of these two nations to freely decide on their  political and state status. At the same time, the Assembly  maintains that the creation of a new federation and its entering  into a confederation with Croatia means a formal and legal  suspension of the former Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina.    By not being included in the talks, the RS has in fact been  recognized as a state entity. The RS cannot join the  Croat-Muslim Federation because conditions do not exist for a  joint state, the platform stresses.    Since the new Croat-Muslim state can engage in hostile  activities against the RS, the RS must -- in the interest of  lasting peace and stability in the region -- secure just and  defendable borders that will encompass Serb ethnic areas, the  platform says, adding that when conditions for the continuation  of talks are created the RS will maintain a stand that the  negotiating process be conducted in stages.    The first stage is to conclude peace and freeze all military  activities without prejudging territorial solutions or the  nature of future interstate ties.    This would be followed by demarcation and the final  establishment of borders between the Croat-Muslim Federation and  the Srpska republic, and the recognition of the sovereignty and  independence of the Srpska republic.    Talks on mutual relations between these states, together  with  the review of possibilities for the establishment of different  ties between the newly created and former Yugoslav republics,  would be the last stage.    The resolution of the crisis, it was said, should be guided  by scientifically established facts about the Serbs, Croats,  Muslims, and their territories, as well as by international  documents on the creation of Yugoslavia.    The platform also proposes an alternative order of stages,  as  recognized by the international community -- including the  United States -- when Yugoslavia was founded in 1919 [sentence  as received].    In the first stage, apart from the already recognized Croat-  Muslim Federation, the international community should also  recognize the Srpska republic and leave territorial questions  for some later date.    The second stage would be to resolve territorial issues  peacefully, while the third would be to examine possible ties  between the states.     "

After talks yesterday in Cairo with his Soviet counterpart, Mr Alexander Bessmertnykh, Mr Baker told reporters that there were 'significant differences' between Israel and Syria on a UN role at a proposed conference, and on the exact nature of the gathering. Damascus is pressing for a comprehensive settlement of the Middle East dispute on the basis of Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, which require Israel to withdraw from land occupied in the 1967 war, including Syria's Golan Heights. But Israeli leaders discount UN participation, saying the world body is biased. Israel is also against a regional conference that has any status beyond that of a ceremonial 'opening' to direct talks with its neighbours. Syria wants a regional gathering to have a role in overseeing peace moves. With the Baker mission hung up on these procedural issues, other knotty questions are tending to be overlooked at this stage, such as the perennial problem of who might represent the Palestinians. Mr Baker is pressing for a joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegation to overcome Israel's objection to sitting down with representatives of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, which it describes as a 'terrorist gang'. Officials close to Mr Baker have warned that if by the end of the week there is little sign of progress, the US secretary of state will abandon his latest round of peace-making and return to Washington. Mr Baker is seeking to put the best public face on a very unpromising situation, but in private US officials have sounded pessimistic. A rash of statements from Mr Yitzhak Shamir, Israel's premier, in the past few days insisting that there would be no territorial compromise have cast a deepening shadow over the Baker mission. Mr Bessmertnykh tried to sound a faint note of optimism after his meeting with Mr Baker, telling reporters that 'our talks on the Middle East have reached a large plateau.' Problems were fewer than before which gave 'ground for hope', he added. Mr Bessmertnykh was due to meet Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO leader, in Geneva today. 'They are meeting here on Tuesday but that's all I can say at this stage,' said a PLO official in Geneva.

By NICK B. WILLIAMS Jr., TIMES STAFF WRITER      NICOSIA, Cyprus      Whipped by tough words from Arab hard-liners and the installation of a new  rightist government in Israel, a prickly wind is pushing through the Middle  East.    Gusts of inflammatory talk are building, and the rhetoric is warlike and blunt.  According to Western diplomats in the region, the rhetoric reflects genuine  concerns on both sides.    ""What is coming is not a limited danger but a danger of destiny,"" Syrian  President Hafez Assad declared earlier this week, calling for Arab solidarity.  He spoke of conflict and said the Arabs will win on the strength of their  numbers.    ""Israel is still advanced over Arabs technologically and could inflict on them  human disasters in the case of war,"" Assad told his Parliament. ""But Arabs,  with what they own, can exchange the disasters in the same way. . . . Because  the Arabs have . . . depth (in population), which Israel lacks, the exchange of  disasters would have more weight on the Israelis.""    The tension began tightening three months ago when Israel's national unity  government shattered over deep differences on peace talks with the  Palestinians. Weeks later, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein threatened to ""burn  half of Israel"" with chemical weapons if his country were attacked.    Since then, dangerous episodes have incited further alarm. A deranged Israeli  civilian shot to death seven Palestinian workers near Tel Aviv in an unprovoked  attack, spurring an outburst of violence in Israeli-occupied territories. Then,  in a brazen response, guerrillas of a radical faction of the Palestine  Liberation Organization tried to raid Israeli beaches; the attack was thwarted  by Israeli forces who killed four of the raiders.    On top of it all came the steady immigration of Soviet Jews to Israel, stirring  Arab fears of a bolstered enemy.    Anxiety and aggressiveness are clear even to outsiders in the Arab countries.    ""I've picked a good time to go,"" a retiring Western diplomat told a recent  visitor to Amman, Jordan, expressing fear that the Middle East is moving  towards another of its periodic wars.    Said an American arms salesman who travels widely in the region: ""It's getting  goosey out there. I haven't seen it this bad before. The Arabs think Israel  needs a war, and they're getting hostile as hell.""    A statement Monday by the PLO on the guerrilla raid, received in full text here  Tuesday, termed the climate an uncertain ""state of no-peace, no-war"" and  claimed that the PLO has opted for peace.    But the statement also fanned the talk of war, saying, ""Everybody knows that  the (new) Israeli government is preparing to launch a new war, to escalate its  oppression and massacre of Palestinians, to attack the Arab countries and to  expand its settlement of our occupied land.""    Added Faisal Husseini, a pro-PLO activist in East Jerusalem: ""I think it is a  government of war, and I think the decisions of such a government will be a  decision of war.""    But Yitzhak Shamir, prime minister of the new government, rejects the Arab  chorus that his is a war Cabinet. He told reporters: ""We will definitely work  with all our power for peace. . . . Our call for direct talks is not an empty  declaration but a real and sincere appeal to our neighbors to turn their backs  to hostility and war and proceed to the negotiating table. ""    Under the policy guidelines of the new government, however, Arab calls for an  international peace conference are not acceptable, nor is the Palestinian  demand for sovereignty over the occupied territories of the West Bank and Gaza  Strip.    ""It would be crazy on our part to agree to any concession in the area which is  the soft belly of the land of Israel when around us we have a hostile ring that  has unprecedented military power,"" the prime minister said, adding that he will  continue Jewish settlement of the territories.    Shamir's political nemesis, Shimon Peres, who led the Labor Party out of the  national unity government, belittled the prospects for peace under the new  regime. ""Its composition and guidelines are not bringing peace,"" he remarked.  ""It has no ability to change, has no joy of hope. It is a sad government for  its members and a sorrowful government for Israel.""    War scenarios abound in the Middle East:    Israel, threatened by advances in military technology by hostile Arab nations  -- particularly missile-delivery systems -- orders a preemptive strike to knock  out the systems. Iraq, mentioned as a likely target, has vowed to retaliate  with its own ""weapons of mass destruction"" if Israel attacks with similar arms.    The potential collapse of the U.S. dialogue with the PLO and the rise of  radical leadership in the organization leads to stepped-up guerrilla attacks  across Israeli borders, prompting an Israeli response.    Determination to put down the Palestinian uprising in the occupied territories  prompts an Israeli military operation to push the populace out of the West Bank  and into Jordan.    An outbreak of fighting between Arab enemies -- Syria and Iraq, for instance --  drags Israel into the conflict.    Military analysts say the next Middle East war will be the worst, with all  combatants now maintaining missiles and high-performance fighter-bombers, and  Israel and several Arab states reported to have chemical warheads. Bringing  firepower on a distant target would take a matter of an hour or less.    And ultimately, Israel is reputed to have nuclear warheads as well. The  prospects for the loss of civilian life in such a conflict would be high.    ""We are not interested in any wars, in any confrontations with our neighbors,""  Shamir told Israel Radio before the formation of his government.    The Arab leaders say the same.    ""We remain committed to work alongside all local and international forces to  realize a just and comprehensive peace in the region. . . ,"" proclaimed  Monday's PLO statement.    Nevertheless, the Middle East is clearly in a dangerous passage. The  pressure-release of peace talks -- or even talks about talks -- under the  formula supported by the Bush Administration appears dead. Shamir rejects the  tacit PLO involvement in such talks. His favored proposal -- to make peace with  Israel's Arab neighbors one by one, following the example of Egypt -- has so  far stirred no open Arab interest.    If the U.S. dialogue with the PLO collapses over the Palestinians' refusal to  specifically condemn last month's abortive beach raid, Yasser Arafat's  organization could become a loose cannon again. Regional tension and war talk  are likely to continue.      BACKGROUND    For a long time, the United States and the Soviet Union controlled the arms  race in the Mideast because they provided most of the weaponry. But in recent  years, they have lost control as their regional influence declined. Now, many  Mideast nations have their own arms industries. Israel, Iraq, Syria, Saudi  Arabia and Iran all have ballistic missiles. Israel is believed to have nuclear  and chemical weapons. Iraq and Syria have chemical weapons, and Iraq could have  nuclear weapons within the decade. Egypt is believed to have revived its  chemical arms program. And Libya also may be producing poison gas.

Mr Boutros Ghali said after talks in London with the British foreign secretary, Mr Douglas Hurd, that the conference would need careful preparation as well as the approval of all the warring parties in ex-Yugoslavia and the participants of last year's talks in London. 'We are still preparing the idea. We believe that this idea may help us to find a solution,' Mr Boutros Ghali said. He said he held exploratory talks on Monday with the Norwegian mediator, Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, who is the UN envoy in the Yugoslavia peace talks, and would meet him again today. Mr Hurd said the other mediator, Lord Owen, who is the representative of the European Community, approved of the idea of a new London conference and would discuss it with EC foreign ministers when they meet in Luxembourg today. 'There's no good calling a conference tomorrow with no guarantee it is to succeed. So it needs careful preparation and that's what its receiving,' Hurd said. In fighting in Bosnia yesterday a Danish lorry driver was killed and nine other UN workers wounded when their relief convoy was caught in crossfire between Croats and Moslems in central Bosnia. In Sarajevo, up to 13 people were injured in an attack on a market amid an upsurge in shelling by Serb forces on Mount Zuc, north-west of the capital, Bosnian radio said. The Bosnian president, Mr Alija Izetbegovic, yesterday named his foreign minister, Mr Haris Silajdzic, to the vacant post of prime minister and also included him in the republic's collective presidency. His appointment may reflect intensified efforts to reach a settlement with Serb adversaries as Mr Silajdzic, a Moslem, is the key figure for bilateral negotiations with the Bosnian Serbs. He was singled out at the weekend by Mr Momcilo Krajisnik, a Bosnian Serb leader, for 'having turned around and understood reality'. Meanwhile, relief operations of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees suffered a severe setback when two convoys, escorted by British armoured vehicles, were hit by machinegun and mortar fire as they crossed a frontline south of Novi Travnik. Another Danish driver was wounded and eight Dutch soldiers accompanying the military supply convoy were hurt.

The talks in Mexico between the government and the guerrillas of the National Guatemalan Revolutionary Unit come amid a climate of instability fuelled by recent coup rumours and apparent divisions in the army over the possible outcome of the talks. The negotiations, at which a United Nations moderator will be present, are to address the delicate issue of a human rights agreement and the creation of a commission to investigate past abuses. The meeting will be the first since the signing of a framework agreement in January, in which both sides stated their political will to reach a settlement this year. Guatemala's President Ramiro de Leon Carpio, a former human rights official who became head of state last June, badly needs a public relations victory, after his image has begun to wilt both locally and internationally. But senior army officers, including the minister of defence, have made it clear they take a dim view of a proposal to form a commission which would investigate violations during the internal conflict, which has cost more than 100,000 lives. The substantial constituency in the army against the peace talks, and particularly an investigative commission, has cast doubt on professed optimism in government circles of an imminent breakthrough. However, sources close to the government delegation believe the guerrillas may allow discussions on the commission to be put to one side. The guerrillas have maintained throughout the four-year long negotiations that the creation of such a commission, and a commitment to international verification of human rights observance, are requirements if it is to sign an agreement on human rights. The issue has highlighted divisions between the civilian government and the military. Mr Hector Rosada, the head of the government's team in the talks, which includes two generals and a colonel, has said that a commission is necessary if peace is to bring minimal comfort to the hundreds of thousands of relatives of victims during the conflict.

The leaders of the three main ethnic groups in Bosnia met for unscheduled talks which included Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, his Croatian counterpart Mr Franjo Tudjman and President Momir Bulatovic of Montenegro, which with Serbia forms the rump Yugoslav state. The talks came as international mediators Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg tried to persuade Mr Izetbegovic to drop his demand that a future Bosnia be based on centralised federation. Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader and Mr Mate Boban, his Bosnian Croat counterpart, have called for the creation of a loose confederation, which Mr Izetbegovic says will lead to more war and the possible annexation of large parts of Bosnia to Serbia and Croatia. The two peace envoys reportedly told Mr Izetbegovic that a newly created mainly Moslem state would receive economic aid from Moslem countries as well as the US. Mr Reginald Bartholomew, the special envoy of US president Bill Clinton who so far has maintained a distance from the peace talks, yesterday met Mr Izetbegovic for private talks. The mediators have pledged, in the event of the republic's ethnic division, that the mainly Moslem state would be granted at least 30 per cent of Bosnian territory and access to ports on the Adriatic Sea and the northern River Sava. They appear convinced, despite the upsurge in fighting in Bosnia, that Serb and Croat leaders would be willing to make territorial concessions to the Moslems. Serb forces control about 70 per cent of Bosnian territory and the Croats about 20 per cent. Mr Izetbegovic is likely to be sceptical that the international community will provide muscle to back the security of a Bosnian state. But Mr Mustafa Bijedic, chief of Bosnia's UN mission in Geneva, yesterday said: 'We were encouraged by the signs of support expressed by the co-chairmen.'

The move came as Israel and Jordan resumed bilateral talks about borders, water, trade, finance and banking, saying they had agreed to use the 1922 British Mandate lines as a basis for demarcating the frontier, an apparent concession to Jordan. The resumption of talks on the Israeli side of the Dead Sea, aimed at finalising a formal peace treaty, came a day after the two states opened a new border crossing 3kms north of the Red Sea. Mr Elyakim Rubinstein, chief Israeli negotiator, said the two would open a second border crossing in the north once its exact location was agreed. An Israeli negotiator said Israel would allow Jordanian imports preferential access to the market in the Israeli-occupied West Bank in recognition of Jordan's peace gestures. A list of Jordanian products allowed access to the West Bank would be drawn up soon. Such an agreement would give Jordanian goods access to the much larger Israeli market as there are no formal trade barriers between the West Bank and Israel proper. The pact will last until Israel transfers the West Bank to Palestinian self-rule after Palestinian elections due in mid-December. Trade experts say the impact of Jordanian imports on Israel's Dollars 70bn (Pounds 46.6bn) economy, insignificant initially, will have profound effects on Jordan which last year had a trade deficit of Dollars 2.4bn. Border demarcation and water remain tougher obstacles. Jordan is seeking 380 sq kms of the Arava Desert it claims Israel has occupied. It wants its 'rightful allocation' (a geographical term under international law) of the waters of the Jordan and Yarmouk Rivers it claims Israel has diverted since 1967. In joint working groups yesterday, both sides made progress on accords for an air corridor for Jordanian flights over Israel, connection of the two countries' electricity grids, crossing points, and prevention of drug trafficking.

0,FT933-1898 ,"FT933-1898 _AN-DIVB9AA2FT 930922   FT  22 SEP 93 / Moslems say sea access agreed: Deal with Croats could clear obstacle to Bosnian peace      By GILLIAN TETT   BOSNIAN Moslem leaders yesterday said they had agreed with Croat leaders on the crucial question of access to the sea for the Bosnian Moslem republic, potentially clearing a big obstacle to a broader peace deal. In Zagreb, Mr Haris Silajdic, Bosnian foreign minister, said the dispute over access to the Adriatic had been resolved during secret talks between Croat, Serb and Bosnian Moslem leaders on a British naval vessel in the Adriatic on Monday. But in an apparent blow to a rapid agreement, Bosnia's Moslem President Alija Izetbegovic yesterday said he could not recommend acceptance of the latest peace plan to end the republic's 17-month war. 'I personally am not inclined towards that proposal,' he said in Sarajevo. 'I think that the solution for access to the sea fits the needs of Bosnia in an economic sense. . . But I am not satisfied with the territorial solution.' Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, international mediator, said however: 'We are closer to a solution than at any time in the history of the negotiations.' The Bosnian parliament is due next Monday to consider the peace plan, which would create a loose 'union' of three ethnic mini-states. The latest peace proposals includes four separate territorial agreements between the Bosnian Moslem and Croat leaders, including a plan to give the Bosnian state a port on the River Neretva near the village of Celjevo, joined by an additional corridor and road to the Moslem state, and a 99-year lease on a facility in the Croatian port of Ploce. Mr John Mills, the mediators' spokesman, yesterday said the Bosnian Serbs had also offered the Moslems extra land around the eastern enclaves, although Moslem demands for land around the northeast enclave of Bihac had apparently not been met. Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, however, played down Serb concessions. Although the Moslems have repeatedly said the village of Neum should be their port, the Croat leaders have resisted this, saying Moslem control of Neum would leave the Croat port of Dubrovnik isolated. However, as a sign of the pressure now mounting on Mr Izetbegovic to accept an alternative, Mr Mills said that the talks had taken into account findings which confirmed Neum would be ill-suited for a deep-water port. The accord now envisages that part of Neum will be controlled by the Moslems, with a joint Croat-Moslem authority to develop tourism in the area. Meanwhile, heavy fighting was yesterday reported to be continuing in Central Bosnia, in defiance of the latest ceasefire accord. Moslem troops were reported to be advancing on Croat-held areas in the central Bosnian town of Vitez, and on Mostar, further south. And in a grim omen for winter, 10 people were reported to have died of starvation in the central Bosnian town of Zenica, where some 150,000 Moslems have been increasingly isolated by recent fighting between Moslems and Croats.

In a rare appearance in the west after long talks in Geneva with President Bill Clinton, Mr Assad called for a 'peace of the brave' and said he wished to see stability and security in the region and normal relations between all states. Syria had made the 'strategic choice' to seek peace with Israel after years of confrontation. Mr Assad's call for normal relations could give a significant boost to negotiations between Syria and Israel, the most important component of an eventual comprehensive Middle East peace agreement still to fall into place. Senior US officials said they were greatly encouraged by the words used by Mr Assad, particularly on relations with Israel. 'These are words that Israel has long waited to hear,' said one. Mr Clinton stressed that the outline accord between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation represented an important first step towards peace. But he and Mr Assad also emphasised that for any deal to be durable it had to include the other Arab partners to the process. 'Syria is the key to a comprehensive and enduring peace that will finally put an end to conflict between Israel and her Arab neighbours,' said Mr Clinton. He confirmed that the heads of the Syrian, Lebanese and Jordanian negotiating teams would be in Washington next week to resume contacts with Israel and discuss a full resumption of the talks broken off last summer. Syria has insisted that it would be pointless to resume negotiations without a prior Israeli commitment to withdraw fully from the Golan Heights, occupied in 1967. Israel has demanded that Syria should state its willingness to exchange ambassadors and open its borders to trade and travellers, before it would say from how much of the Golan it would withdraw. Mr Clinton said he was encouraged by the Syrian leader's statement and he hoped for a positive response from Israel. Speaking aboard Air Force One, as he returned to Washington last night, he said Mr Assad 'has reached the conclusion that it is in the interests of his people, his administration and his legacy to make a meaningful and lasting peace. I believe that.' Mr Clinton added that his trip to Europe had 'met all of our objectives'. In Jerusalem, Israeli officials were cautiously positive. Mr Yossi Beilin, deputy foreign minister, said significant words were spoken at the press conference, mainly by Mr Clinton. Israel was waiting to hear from a US delegation last night about what was said behind closed doors. The two presidents agreed to set up a committee under Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, and Mr Farouk al-Sharaa, the Syrian foreign minister, to explore bilateral differences between the two countries.

Mr.  Aleksandr Saltanov said the Jordanian role will contribute to  pushing forward the peace process in the region.    In an interview with the Jordan News Agency, he said Jordan,  under the wise leadership of his majesty the king, plays a  central role in the peace process. The Russian envoy said the  progress on the Jordanian-Israeli track and the talks cannot be  regarded as a separate peace deal.    He said this achievement should be accompanied by progress  on  other tracks as well. The Russian ambassador explained that  when the whole peace process began back in Madrid in 1991, it  was clear that unilateral tracks were not the same as regards  the depth of problems, and so, he said, it is natural that  progress on each track depends on what problems it faces.    And speaking on Jordan's water rights, Mr. Saltanov stressed  that the water issue is one of the most complicated problems in  the Middle East. And he went on to say that solving the water  resources problem and making sure that each party attains its  own water rights should have priority in negotiations between  Arab parties and Israel.

The paper says that Israel continues to repeat this because  Syria, from the outset of the peace talks, has been rejecting  any peace outside the Madrid formula, stressing that peace  should be based on the resolutions of international legitimacy.    AL-BA'TH adds: This position basically conflicts with the  known Israeli plans to drag the Arab parties into signing  separate peace deals which would acknowledge everything Israel  wants.    AL-BA'TH notes that Syria's consistent and positive position  on the peace process has been described by the U.S.  administration and all world governments as the key to regional  peace. The paper adds: The Geneva summit results and President  Hafiz al-Asad's statements proved without any doubt that Syria  is truly working for a just and comprehensive peace in the  region, especially since the president stressed full withdrawal  in return for full peace. In this regard, the paper points to  the U.S. President's reply that Syria has the right to demand  the establishment of a just and comprehensive peace.    AL-BA'TH continues: Definitely, this U.S. statement was  based on the facts of the regional conflict, and, consequently,  on a conviction that it is impossible for partial and separate  solutions to bring about regional security, peace, and stability.    Concluding, AL-BA'TH says: Despite all that happened and may  happen, the region will remain far from the real peace  emphasized by the international community, unless there is full  and absolute commitment to implementing all the requirements of  a just and comprehensive peace, chief of which is a  comprehensive Israeli withdrawal from the occupied territories.    In the ""With the Events"" column, the newspaper AL-BA'TH  says:  The road to peace has clear features and signs. It begins with  the implementation of the UN and Security Council resolutions.  If this is not achieved, the national resistance in Lebanon  will continue and will not retreat or compromise. The Israelis  know better than others the resolve and solidity of this  resistance. Only justice will triumph.     "

Shahaq, who also heads the Security Committee of the Taba talks,  said that the talks will resume on 31 January, provided that  issues currently in disagreement will be settled in the upcoming  meeting between Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres and PLO leader  Yasir 'Arafat. Our Knesset correspondent Tamar Asalem reports:    [Begin recording] [Asalem] Maj. Gen. Shahaq, deputy chief  of staff, like all the other persons involved in the peace  talks, is waiting for the results of the Peres-'Arafat meeting  next weekend. Shahaq said that the prime minister and the  foreign minister were briefed this morning about the Army's  security stands, which will be presented in the meeting with  'Arafat. If indeed agreements are made over the weekend, the  Security Committee of the Taba talks will reconvene as soon as  31 January.    Gen. Shahaq addressed the claim that Fatah Hawks have been  joining Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] and taking part in  terror attacks against Israel:    [Shahaq] We have witnessed cases where some of those  identified with the Fatah Hawks said they do not accept the PLO  or Fatah authority, that they are quitting the organization, and  that they will continue to fight against us. We, at the same  time, stated that we will continue fighting them until we catch  them.    [Asalem] Shahaq added that the PLO does not yet have full  authority over the field, and cannot impose its will on  individuals who quit Fatah. In any event, Shahaq said, the IDF  will be in charge of capturing the fugitives until April. I do  not know what status they will have in the eyes of the  Palestinian police force, he added.    Gen. Shahaq stated that a real war is being waged in south  Lebanon.    [Shahaq] This is war, waged daily in more than one way by  more than one organization -- not just Hizballah fights us and  the SLA [South Lebanese Army] there. The IDF and the SLA  soldiers carry the burden of this war in south Lebanon.    [Asalem] Shahaq said that the number of incidents in the  north has doubled last year, in comparison to 1992.  Nevertheless, over the past several weeks, there has been a  decline in the volume and nature of Hizballah activity. The  Army explains this by the fact that Syria had pressured  Hizballah before the Clinton-al-Asad summit last week.    Regarding Syria, Gen. Shahaq addressed himself to the  remarks  by Major General 'Uzi Dayan [that war may break out this year if  the peace talks fail], and said that he fails to understand the  storm they caused. According to Shahaq, Dayan was not  presenting an evaluation of the situation, rather he presented  working assumptions of the Planning Branch, which is a routine  matter.    To conclude, Shahaq was asked about his personal stand  regarding the fact that members of the Knesset committee have  occassionaly been wondering about the involvement of military  men in peace negotiations. Shahaq answered that he does not  have a problem with this and, should he have a problem with it,  he will present it to the appropriate officials. [end recording]     "
0,FT944-18148 ,"FT944-18148 _AN-EJED5ACEFT 941005   FT  05 OCT 94 / IRA beatings may delay peace talks      By STEWART DALBY, DAVID GARDNER and GEORGE GRAHAM      BELFAST, BRUSSELS   The continuing use of punishment beatings in republican areas of Belfast - thought to be the work of the provisional IRA - could delay the start of talks between London and Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing. A British official yesterday warned: 'All military activity may have stopped, strictly speaking, but the violence in republican areas is continuing. We have to consider whether this is terrorism by another name.' London has promised to start a dialogue on how to admit Sinn Fein to political talks on Northern Ireland's future within three months of a permanent end to IRA violence. The emergence of a possible new obstacle to the peace process coincided yesterday with mixed signals on the prospects for financial aid for the province to help smooth the path to a durable settlement. Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, said the European Union should decide by Christmas on whether to make new aid grants focusing on urban renewal and infrastructure. The 'peace grants' would be in addition to EU funds already committed to the province, he said after he and Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, briefed EU foreign ministers on recent developments. Specific sums were not mentioned yesterday but Mr Spring said he expected December's summit in Essen of EU leaders to agree a substantial package. Part of the new money could eventually go towards dismantling the 'peace walls' separating the two northern communities, senior officials said. But Mr Hurd made it clear that could only happen 'if people want it to happen'. The EU has allocated Ecu1.23bn (Pounds 960m) in aid to northern Ireland for 1994-99, and raised its annual contribution to the International Fund for Ireland from Ecu15m to Ecu20m. US officials have been trying to lower the level of expectations. A senior administration official said: 'I don't think any large assistance package of direct aid is on the cards. We just don't have that kind of budget flexibility.' Dr John Alderdice, leader of the non-sectarian Alliance party, also drew this conclusion from his talks with US officials this week. The White House is examining less direct forms of aid, such as enhancing the role of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation and accelerating spending from the International Fund for Ireland - to which the US contributes. The continuing violence will be another obstacle for Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, as he tries to increase pressure on London to start talks on his return from the US later this week. A further three beatings came to light this week, taking the total number of beatings in republican ares to 10 since the IRA ceasefire on August 31. In the same period last year there was only one punishment beating. The provisional IRA has not admitted it is responsible for the beatings but the Royal Ulster Constabulary is convinced that it is.

He announced the government was ready to open exploratory talks with Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, before the end of the year. In a landmark speech in Belfast in which he confirmed the government's 'working assumption' that the IRA intended a permanent end to violence, Mr Major disclosed plans for a steady easing of security measures in the province. His comments evoked a warm response in Dublin, modest encouragement from the Ulster Unionists and calls from Sinn Fein for direct negotiations not to be delayed. But Dr Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionists, accused Mr Major of 'caving in' to the IRA. Mr Major, who is to meet Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, on Monday, also emphasised his determination to accelerate negotiations on a new political settlement. In spite of the refusal of Sinn Fein explicitly to renounce violence for good, he said, the actions of the Republican movement during its six-week ceasefire pointed to a permanent end to the violence. The orders excluding Mr Gerry Adams and Mr Martin McGuinness, the two leading spokesmen for Sinn Fein, from the British mainland were lifted. All border crossings with the Republic are being reopened. Declaring that 'from this moment we are in a new phase of the peace process', the prime minister said measures marked the start of a 'full return to democratic life'. The aim was 'to make a return to violence unthinkable'. Mr Major spelled out plans to create a new Ulster assembly and laid out the principles that would guide negotiations with the Irish Republic on a constitutional framework for the province. His speech included also a commitment to a large-scale initiative to rebuild the Northern Ireland economy with a concerted effort to encourage inward investment and substantial European Union aid. Overall, it marked a carefully balanced effort to reassure the unionist community of their continuing veto over the province's constitutional future while meeting the concerns of the nationalist community. The prime minister's talks with Mr Reynolds are designed to remove the remaining obstacles to a joint framework document on relations between the two governments and between Northern Ireland and the Republic. Mr Major indicated that once the document is completed, the British side will publish also its ideas for a new, devolved assembly in Northern Ireland. The proposed assembly, which would be elected under a system of proportional voting, would give representation to all differing shades of opinion within the province. But in a warning of the difficulties to come, Mr Major said that a lasting peace could be guaranteed only when the IRA and loyalist groups had surrendered their guns and explosives. He said the London government intended to establish a joint approach with Dublin. Mr Mitchel McLaughlin, northern chairman of Sinn Fein, said he saw 'the discussion on the political issues as part of the taking the gun out of Irish politics . . . Clearly there would have to be agreement on political structures to remove the potential for political violence. That political violence arose out of a lack of agreement.'

By DANIEL WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER      JERUSALEM      Ariel Sharon, the former tank commander turned hawkish politician, set his  sights Sunday on bringing down Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and derailing  proposed peace talks with Palestinians.    In confirming his resignation from Shamir's Cabinet, Sharon predicted doom for  Israel if the government goes ahead with plans to let Palestinians in the  occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip elect a peace delegation.    ""I don't remember as dangerous a situation as we are facing now. The plan will  not bring us to peace. It will bring us to more tension, bloodshed and maybe  even to war,"" said Sharon, who as defense minister led Israel into the  unpopular 1982 Lebanon War.    The portly Sharon said he would campaign within the rightist Likud Party to  unseat Shamir in time to run for prime minister himself. ""I saw that to  continue in the government without being able to warn our people about the  disastrous outcome would be a mistake. It would be lying to myself,"" he said.  ""I will continue my struggle from the outside.""    Elections are not due for almost three years, although a collapse of the  fragile coalition between Likud and the more dovish, center-left Labor Party  could bring on a premature vote.    Sharon stepped down from his post as trade and industry minister amid reports  that Israel may soon engage the United States and Egypt in talks to name a  Palestinian panel to prepare for elections. His resignation was viewed in  Israel as a challenge not only to Shamir, but also associates of Shamir who  might aspire to succeed the 74-year-old prime minister.    Among the prime candidates is Moshe Arens, the foreign minister who is in  charge of delicate negotiations on the peace proposals.    Sharon's dramatic withdrawal from government -- he announced his exit during a  raucous meeting of Likud last week -- is but the latest episode in a maverick  style for which he is notorious.    He became a hero of the 1973 Middle East War by leading troops across the Suez  Canal, despite the misgivings of superiors, and surrounding a main force of  Egyptians. During the Lebanon War, he was criticized for turning what was  advertised as a sweep of terrorists up to 25 miles from the Israeli border into  the siege of Beirut and a frustrated effort to set up a friendly Christian  government.    Sharon resigned from his defense post in 1983 amid charges that he was  indirectly responsible for a massacre of Palestinians in Beirut at the hands of  Israel's Christian allies. In 1987, at the onset of the Arab uprising, Sharon  moved into a private home in the Muslim Quarter of Jerusalem's Old City,  further inflaming Palestinian passions.    Sharon said that in a matter of months, he could end the intifada, as the  uprising is called in Arabic. He recommended that known Palestinian leaders  should be expelled from the country. He was less specific about how much force  he would use, except by reference to his 1971 effort, as army general, to root  out nationalist assassination squads from the Gaza Strip.    During the seven-month Gaza operation led by Sharon, Israeli troops killed more  than 100 Palestinians. His troops bulldozed buildings to open the way for  street patrols and tore down hedges to eliminate hiding places. To keep  rebellious youths from taking part, Sharon expelled to neighboring countries a  small number of parents whose children were seen throwing stones at soldiers.    ""Gaza was completely quiet for 10 years after,"" Sharon claimed.    In settling the dispute with Palestinians, Sharon insisted, Israel must be sure  to keep fundamental control of the occupied land. ""It will be our right to be  in charge of the security in Judea, Samaria and Gaza,"" he declared, using  Biblical terms for the West Bank. ""And that will be forever.""    He also pledged to avoid compromises he views as putting Israel's control of  Jerusalem in doubt. ""Jerusalem is the heart of the Jewish people.

By DANIEL WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER      JERUSALEM      Ariel Sharon, the former tank commander turned hawkish politician, set his  sights Sunday on bringing down Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and derailing  proposed peace talks with Palestinians.    In confirming his resignation from Shamir's Cabinet, Sharon predicted doom for  Israel if the government goes ahead with plans to let Palestinians in the  occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip elect a peace delegation.    ""I don't remember as dangerous a situation as we are facing now. The plan will  not bring us to peace. It will bring us to more tension, bloodshed and maybe  even to war,"" said Sharon, who as defense minister led Israel into the  unpopular 1982 Lebanon War.    The portly Sharon said he would campaign within the rightist Likud Party to  unseat Shamir in time to run for prime minister himself. ""I saw that to  continue in the government without being able to warn our people about the  disastrous outcome would be a mistake. It would be lying to myself,"" he said.  ""I will continue my struggle from the outside.""    Elections are not due for almost three years, although a collapse of the  fragile coalition between Likud and the more dovish, center-left Labor Party  could bring on a premature vote.    Sharon stepped down from his post as trade and industry minister amid reports  that Israel may soon engage the United States and Egypt in talks to name a  Palestinian panel to prepare for elections. His resignation was viewed in  Israel as a challenge not only to Shamir, but also associates of Shamir who  might aspire to succeed the 74-year-old prime minister.    Among the prime candidates is Moshe Arens, the foreign minister who is in  charge of delicate negotiations on the peace proposals.    Sharon's dramatic withdrawal from government -- he announced his exit during a  raucous meeting of Likud last week -- is but the latest episode in a maverick  style for which he is notorious.    He became a hero of the 1973 Middle East War by leading troops across the Suez  Canal, despite the misgivings of superiors, and surrounding a main force of  Egyptians. During the Lebanon War, he was criticized for turning what was  advertised as a sweep of terrorists up to 25 miles from the Israeli border into  the siege of Beirut and a frustrated effort to set up a friendly Christian  government.    Sharon resigned from his defense post in 1983 amid charges that he was  indirectly responsible for a massacre of Palestinians in Beirut at the hands of  Israel's Christian allies.

0,FT944-1570 ,"FT944-1570 _AN-ELTDSAAOFT 941220   FT  20 DEC 94 / Brussels talks seek end to fish row with Spain      By DAVID GARDNER      BRUSSELS   European Union expansion from 12 to 15 nation-states from January 1 was still at risk last night, as the EU struggled to agree the terms of Spain's full integration into the Union's Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). EU fisheries ministers were meeting in Brussels in an effort to put flesh on the bones of the tacit agreement brokered by the current German presidency of the EU at last week's summit of European leaders in Essen. But differences over details of Spanish access to waters west of the UK and Ireland, and over control mechanisms on over-fishing of diminishing stocks, were still far from being resolved, EU negotiators said. The Spanish government has said it will not complete ratification of enlargement  - set to bring Austria, Sweden, and Finland into the Union in January  - unless the CFP issue is settled. Spain and Portugal were promised in March that they would be fully integrated into the CFP by January 1996  - six years ahead of the date agreed in 1986 when the Iberian countries became member states. All member states agreed that if new member states were to get full rights then restrictions on the Spanish fleet  - the EU's largest  - could no longer be justified. Last spring's enlargement talks were in great part dominated by Spain's objections to allowing Norway to gain EU entry on terms far better than those offered to the Iberians. Norway is one of Europe's leading fishing powers, but, in the event, its people voted against membership. But Spain insists that a political deal was struck in March, and its parliament has told the Madrid government not to formalise ratification unless it is now delivered. At Essen, Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Spanish prime minister Felipe Gonzalez are understood to have reached an agreement whereby there would be no discrimination against Spanish fishing vessels. Translating this into practice is, however, running up against a barrier of national interests. The UK and Ireland want to keep the Spanish fleet as far as possible out of the waters west of their two countries  - the so-called 'Irish Box' which Spanish fishermen traditionally know as the 'Gran Sol'  - while France also wants to restrict Spanish access in the Bay of Biscay, a traditional tuna and anchovy ground for Spain's northern fleet. Spain is currently subject to restrictions which allow 150 out of a list of 300 vessels into the Irish box at any one time. In a hardline document delivered to yesterday's meeting, Spain made clear it would not tolerate any restrictions which are not simultaneously applied to other EU fishing vessels.

The message deals with issues linked to  Angola's current political situation. Minister Venancio de  Moura, who has been visiting New York for three days, took the  opportunity to hold talks with high officials from the U.S.  State Department and White House to discuss the country's  political crisis. Afonso van Dunem, Angola's ambassador to  United Nations, had this to say on the issue:    [Begin Van Dunem recording] In brief, I can say that the  foreign minister has been in New York for two days and his visit  is aimed at delivering a message from the president of the  republic to the UN secretary general. It was a very timely,  useful, and busy visit. [end recording]    We asked Afonso van Dunem to comment about the meeting  between the Angolan foreign minister and the UN secretary  general on the establishment of the new UNAVEM [UN Angola  Verification Mission]-3 contingent, and he said:    [Begin Van Dunem Recording] This issue was touched on  because  a number of steps must be taken before the UNAVEM-2 is  transformed to UNAVEM-3. First, the Security Council has to  meet and approve a resolution sanctioning the UN secretary  general undertaking a process of political and logistical  transformation, and this has a number of implications. However,  the time has not yet come for the Security Council to discuss  the issue of UNAVEM-2's transformation to UNAVEM-3. Obviously,  all this will depend on the whole process, since this does not  depend only on our government. It depends on concrete  conditions on the ground, on the talks which are under way, and  as I have said, on the whole peace process in Angola. [end  recording]    In his diplomatic mission, as well as dealing with political  issues, the Angolan foreign minister took the opportunity to  appeal to the international community to assist the victims of  war in the country.

Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, flew in to the Egyptian capital last night. Mr Shimon Peres and Mr Yossi Sarid, Israel's foreign and environment ministers, are expected to join Mr Christopher, Mr Arafat and Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak for talks this morning aimed at wrapping up the agreement next week. Palestinian negotiators said they hoped Mr Christopher would put pressure on Israel to ease some of its security demands and grant more authority to the incoming Palestinian National Authority. 'We hope (Christopher) can do something as representative of one of the sponsors of this peace process, and do whatever is needed to persuade the Israelis to change some of their polices,' said Mr Faisal al-Husseini, PLO boss in the occupied territories. 'If our control is incomplete and our authority is incomplete, then security will be incomplete. We hope the Israelis understand this.' After he flew in from Saudi Arabia, Mr Christopher inspected some of the 200 vehicles being donated by the US to the new Palestinian police force. A batch of vehicles rolled off a C-5 Galaxy transport aircraft at Cairo airport. More than 20 of the vehicles so far have been flown to Cairo and the rest of the vehicles will arrive by ship at Egypt's Port Said in days. Israel and the PLO said yesterday they still hoped to conclude self-rule talks within days to prepare for a signing ceremony between Mr Arafat and Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, in Cairo next week. Mr Nabil Shaath, chief PLO negotiator, said the talks were 'going fast. Everybody is working day and night'. The negotiations were at the 'stage of final drafting and redrafting', he said, but had still not resolved the serious obstacle - the legal jurisdiction of Palestinian law and courts in Gaza-Jericho. Mr Shaath said both sides were aiming to resolve all issues except the size of the Jericho enclave and the stationing of a Palestinian policemen on the Allenby bridge border-crossing before a Rabin-Arafat meeting. These include sensitive matters that touch on sovereignty, such as the ability of the Palestinians to issue their own stamps, passports and currency and to have their own international dialling code.

The Austrian president called  for a more pronounced European role to propel the peace process  forward on the basis of UN resolutions.    At yesterday's news conference, the Austrian leader  applauded  Jordan's leading role in the effort to bring a just and  comprehensive peace to the Middle East, thereby confirming the  respect in which Jordan, led by His Majesty King Husayn, is held  in Europe and internationally.    Appearing at the same news conference, his majesty called  for  reactivating the peace process, which he warned is now in a  critical condition that threatens to plunge the region into a  disaster, should the peace process unravel. His majesty  reiterated that Middle East security impinges on European  security and vice versa.    His majesty openly called for lifting the unjustifiable  blockade of the Port of al-'Aqabah, and reiterated that Jordan's  continued participation in the bilateral multilateral talks,  slated to reconvene this month, is contingent on removal of the  blockade, which is taking a heavy toll on the country's economy.    His majesty's warning about a regional disaster if the peace  process is not put gack on track was made against the backdrop  of disappointment over the lack of progress on all fronts. His  majesty also indicated that the pressures and harassments  directed at the Arab parties involved in the peace process,  including Jordan, can hardly advance the peace process or  promote a just, lasting, and comprehensive peace in the region.    It does not stand to reason that the blockade should be kept  in place and thus hurt Jordan's economy, trade, and well-being,  and, in the meantime, to expect it to exert itself on behalf of  the peace process. It is all the more absurd that Jordan should  be treated thus, when it has fully complied with UN Security  Council resolutions on Iraq.    The peoples of the region want to see peace established  along  the lines of Resolutions 242, 338, and 425 and the  land-for-peace formula.    It is hoped the European Union and the United States, as  well  as Russia and the other permanent members of the Security  Council, will grasp the significance of his majesty's remark  about the need to reactivate the peace process and put it back  on track on all fronts, before a disaster strikes, when  contrition will be unavailing.

Today's talks are expected to have covered the Middle East  peace process, particularly the Jordanian-Israeli track, in  addition to developments in the Middle East and bilateral ties.    [Begin recording] [Christopher] Good morning. I'm very  honored today to welcome to the State Department King Husayn,  who is an old friend in so many different ways. We're at an  important moment, I think, in the history of the Middle East.    The recent bilateral discussions here between Israel and  Jordan, with the participation of the United States, indicate  that there is room for very real progress in the Middle East,  and I've congratulated the king on that progress and urged that  we would do everything we could to try to assist in that  situation.    Jordan has stood for progress in the Middle East peace  situation and their bilateral track, I think, is one on which  there are great opportunities for the two countries to work  together. So, as always, it's a great pleasure to welcome the  king here. We have many items to discuss -- their defense  needs, the economic situation in Jordan, the path for  democratization in Jordan. We have many items on which we have  common interest, and, of course, many items on which we admire  the king's leadership. So, Your Majesty, it's a great honor to  have you here in the State Department.    [Husayn] Thank you very much indeed, Mr. Secretary. Thank  you very very much indeed for your kind words of welcome, and  I'm very pleased with the opportunity to meet with you today,  sir, and hopefully in the next two days to meet with the  President as well, and many of our friends here in Washington.    We are indeed optimistic as far as the future is concerned  in  our quest for a just, durable, comprehensive peace in the  region. And we are very happy indeed that on the  Jordanian-Israeli track we are about to begin to address the  problems that were a part of the agenda worked out earlier on.  And beginning with border demarcation, delineation, we hope  this will take place on the ground there, and we appreciate  certainly the role of our friends in supporting us and our  efforts to arrive at this point. [end recording]    Today's talks were followed by a working lunch attended by  the prime minister, the chief of the Royal Court, his majesty's  political adviser, Prince Talal Bin-Muhammad, minister of state  for prime ministry affairs, the minister of information, the  minister of finance, and Jordan's ambassador in Washington.    On the U.S. side, it was attended by high-level delegation  from the Departments of State and Defense, as well as President  Clinton's national security adviser.    Sources from the Jordanian delegation told the News at Ten  that today's meeting was fruitful and very successful.    Later tonight his majesty the king will meet U.S. Secretary  of Commerce Ron Brown for talks that will center on trade  relations between the two countries.     "

In his first public comments since Mr John Major, the prime minister, and Mr Albert Reynolds, his Irish counterpart, launched the initiative in Brussels last week, the leader of the biggest political party in the province, the Ulster Unionist party, suggested a Northern Ireland assembly could be set up 'in the fairly short term'. He also responded positively to the six-point plan set out recently by Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, saying it was a 'hopeful sign'. His remarks came as Mr John Hume, leader of the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party, sought to revive his joint peace initiative with Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, by claiming the offer of a 'total cessation of violence' was on the table as a result of their dialogue. Mr Hume said there would be 'peace within a week' if his initiative was embraced. 'My conclusion is that that is now a real possibility - a total cessation of violence, not a ceasefire.' But after an hour-long meeting between Mr Hume and Mr Major, Downing Street issued a fresh rebuff to the SDLP leader, insisting it was last week's statement by Mr Major and Mr Reynolds that had set out the basis for 'peace, stability and reconciliation' in the province. Further cold water was poured over the Hume-Adams plan by Mr Molyneaux, who said it was 'six bridges too far'. In a move likely to inflame Unionists further, Mr Hume said he intended to brief Mr Adams on his meeting at Downing Street. The session was also attended by Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary. Mr Hume indicated later it would no longer be possible for Sir Patrick to say he did not know details of the Hume-Adams initiative. Mr Major is seeing leaders of the province's four constitutional political parties over the next few days. Yesterday's meeting with Mr Hume was followed by a similar session with Mr John Alderdice of the Alliance party. Last night's Downing Street statement emphasised that the government was 'ready' to table proposals to give 'focus and direction' to talks involving the four parties once they agreed to resume negotiations. It emerged yesterday that the Irish government believes it will become clear by early December if there is to be a breakthrough on the Major-Reynolds peace initiative. Mr Reynolds told the Irish parliament he intended to meet Mr Major again on December 3, before the next meeting of the European Council. Dublin also acted to clear up ambiguity over Mr Spring's six points, one of which was that Unionist consent would be required for any constitutional change in the north. Mr Reynolds made it clear this was not meant as an additional concession. In Commons exchanges with Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, Mr Major said he intended to take 'a very direct interest' in peace efforts, while hinting that an early return to round-table talks was unlikely. 'I don't want to see an artificially staged event where the talks are called together with no probability of them making progress,' he said.

It was the first time that Dos Santos, an avowed Marxist, and Savimbi,  president of the U.S.-backed National Union for the Total Independence of  Angola (UNITA), have met to try to negotiate an end to the war that has cost  hundreds of thousands of lives and paralyzed the potentially wealthy former  Portuguese colony.      One-Day Summit    The cease-fire, to take effect at midnight tonight, was part of a declaration  issued at the end of a one-day summit meeting of 18 African leaders, called to  help resolve one of the region's bloodiest conflicts.    Dos Santos and Savimbi sealed the agreement with a symbolic handshake. Details  of the peace framework remained sketchy Thursday night.    President Moussa Traore of Mali, chairman of the Organization of African Unity,  described the meeting at the luxury villa of Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko  as the beginning of a new era for Africa.    ""The handshake symbolizes as from June 24 the end of civil war in Angola,""  Traore said.    Angola and UNITA have declared cease-fires before, but Mobutu, who hosted the  summit to follow up a first regional meeting of African leaders on Angolan  peace in May, said, ""This time it's more serious.""    He also said that Savimbi's future was an issue that came up only at the  summit's end. ""These are really only questions of details,"" he said.    Some reports have suggested that Savimbi, whose South African- and U.S.-backed  forces control large areas of Marxist Angola, might leave the country  temporarily and abandon politics.    The declared cease-fire in the Angolan civil war comes only weeks after  Namibian rebels based in southern Angola ended a 17-year bush war with South  Africa as part of a peace plan for the territory.    Independence elections in Africa's last colony are scheduled to take place  under United Nations supervision in November.    The U.S.-brokered Namibian peace deal also called for the withdrawal from  Angola of 50,000 Cuban soldiers supporting the Luanda government in its fight  against UNITA.    Thursday's declaration ending the summit in Gbadolite said that the next  meeting of the African leaders on Angola will be held in Zimbabwe ""in the very  near future.""    The declaration also said that all Angolans will work for national  reconciliation and that Mobutu will head a commission to monitor the overall  progress toward peace.    ""I hope this summit will create the basis for a return to peace in Angola,""  Mobutu told a news conference.    Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda, acting as spokesman for the summit, said  after more than four hours of talks: ""The heads of state of this summit . . .  can now convey a message of hope to Angola for peace, eternal peace, unity and  development.""    In Pretoria, a spokesman for South African Foreign Minister Roelof F. (Pik)  Botha said that, while proper peace initiatives are always welcome, the  government wants more official information on the Angolan talks before  commenting.    In an indication of the apparent success of the summit, Savimbi and Dos Santos  sat near each other for a group photograph at Mobutu's villa.    Their meeting marked a major diplomatic coup for Mobutu, who is due to visit  Washington later this month.    ""I have come in a spirit of openness,"" Savimbi, wearing a gray Mao-style jacket  and carrying a swagger stick, said earlier when he arrived at this northern  Zairean town, Mobutu's ancestral home.    Savimbi's presence had been in doubt until the last minute. He and Dos Santos  had both made statements earlier this week suggesting they did not intend to  meet here.    Apart from Mobutu, Dos Santos, Traore and Kaunda, other leaders attending the  summit were: President Ibrahim Babangida of Nigeria and the heads of state of  Burundi, Chad, Central African Republic, Rwanda, Botswana, Mozambique, Gabon,  Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Cameroon, Sao Tome e Principe, Congo and Zimbabwe.

V. Vivekanand]    [Text] Amman--A senior Turkish official held high-level  talks here Monday [11 April] on the Middle East peace process  and bilateral relations and said later Ankara attaches much  importance to developing economic cooperation among the  countries of the Middle East.    Ozdem Sanberk, under-secretary of the Turkish Foreign  Ministry, said his talks here also covered the strife in former  Yugoslavia as well as the implications for Turkey and Jordan of  the continuing international sanctions against Iraq.    ""Since Jordan plays a crucial role in the ongoing Middle  East  peace process, the Jordanian side elaborated in detail this  particular issue,"" Mr. Sanberk told the Jordan Times after talks  with Prime Minister 'Abd al-Salam al-Majali and Minister of  State for Foreign Affairs Talal al-Hasan.    Describing the talks as very fruitful, the Turkish official  said there were ""no problems whatsoever between Turkey and  Jordan on the bilateral level,"" and that ""we noted with  satisfaction that our visas concerning the international as well  as regional issues are widely coverging."" [sentence as published]    The Jordan News Agency, Petra, said Minister al-Hasan and  Mr.  Sanberk reviewed progress in the peace process and the  implementation of U.N. Security council resolutions 242 and 338.    Mr. al-Hassan briefed Mr. Sanberk on the continued siege on  the Port of al-'Aqabah and reaffirmed Jordan's call for an end  to the damaging inspections of all ships bound for Jordan.    In his interview with the JORDAN TIMES, Mr. Sanberk restated  his country's stand that Iraq should abide by United Nations  Security Council resolutions. ""Iraq must adopt a clear stand to  give confidence to her neighbour Kuwait,"" he said.    At the same time, he said, the embargo on Iraq continues to  hurt the people of Iraq.    ""It has also created a very heavy economic burden for  Turkey,"" said the official, whose country has been calling for  an easing of the sweeping 44-month-old international sanctions  against its neighbour.    ""The same problem also exists for Jordan,"" he said of the  impact of the sanctions. ""We hope that the point for lifting the  embargo would be reached soon. Cooperation between Iraq and the  U.N. must be intensified to this end.    ""The U.N. long-term monitoring programme (of Iraq's weapons)  must be put fully into practice without delay and be effectively  implemented in order that the oil embargo is lifted,"" he said.    Answering a question, the Turkish official said the outcome  of recent municipal elections in Turkey where Islamic activisits  put up a strong showing had no impact on the secular principles  that the country was founded on.    ""in the modern Turkey founded by Ataturk, Turks are devout,  as always, and the religion is perceived as an individual  choice, an individual realisation of oneself,"" he said.    ""Islam is not reduced in its political dimentions and... the  results (of the elections) reflect not the religious expression  of the individuals but their political preferenes within the  normal functioning of a multiparty democratic system,"" Mr.  Sanberk said.    He said Turkey, which is waging a war against the separatist  Kurdish Labour Party (PKK) in the southeast, wanted ""her  partners and neighbours to abide by their commitments not to  give shelter to those who resort to indiscriminate separatist  violence.""    The official conceded that the Kurdish problem has led to  disputes between Turkey and some of the European countries which  have accused Ankara of violating human rights in its battle  agaisnt the PKK.    But, he said, several countries have in Europe as well as  the  U.S. itself ""declared (the PKK) a terrorist organisation,"" and  France and Germany had banned PKK activities in their  territories.    ""It is obvious that terrorism is a gross violation of human  rights and is aimed at the same time at the destruction of  fundamental aspects of freedom and democracy,"" he said.    Mr. Sanberk said Turkey expects the Middle East peace  process  to create a better atmosphere for regional economic cooperation.    In this a context, he said, a ""peace pipeline""  project--which  will bring Turkish water to the Gulf states and others in the  region--""is still on the table.""    ""It can only be materialised should the countries of the  region see its realisation in their interest and effectively  participate in their realisation,"" added Mr. Sanberk, in an  apparent reference to the financing needed for the project.    When it was first proposed several years ago, the project  was  estimated to cost about $12 billion. Revised estimates put the  cost at between $15 million and $20 million [numbers as  published].    In Ankara on Monday, visiting Israeli Foreign Miniter Shimon  Peres said Turkish and Israeli experts would look into the  possibility of various projects for the shipment of water from  Turkey to Israel. One idea is that water from Manavgat River  could be carried in plastic containes and floated on the  Mediterranean to Israel.     "

The offer, on a 10-for-51 basis, is being recommended by CMRG's board and values Ireland's largest pharmaceutical wholesaler at IPounds 24.9m, representing a 70 per cent premium over its last traded price of 55p on the Dublin USM. There is a partial cash alternative of 87p a share. By yesterday evening, a pre-condition of the offer, that directors of CMRG and their families, and Allied Combined Trust, which together hold 54 per cent of the ordinary share capital, accept irrevocably, had been met. AAH is the UK's largest pharmaceutical wholesaler with annual turnover in excess of Pounds 1.3bn. It has wholesale and franchised retail activities in Northern Ireland. The offer has been triggered by merger talks which began last month between United Drug, another pharmaceutical wholesaler in the Republic, and Alchem in Northern Ireland, which would result in a group with a combined turnover of IPounds 110m. CMRG reported turnover of IPounds 90m in 1991. Mr Bill Pybus, AAH chairman, said: 'We have been interested in CMRG for some time, but when United Drug decided to merge with Alchem we decided to go ahead with an offer.' Last year, United Drug was awarded the franchise for AAH's Vantage retail activity for the Republic, so its Alchem merger plan would put it into direct competition with AAH's own business in Northern Ireland. CMRG is now likely to take over the Vantage franchise in the Republic.  The Financial Times   London Page 28  "

The chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation said  he  was prepared to recommend a deadline for a Palestinian  withdrawal from negotiations after Wednesday, the target date  for Israel's withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho. ""After 13 April,  I have the right to call upon the Palestinian leadership to make  the decision,"" he said at a meeting with journalists organised  by the UN in his Tunis home.    Asked if he was really ready to pull out of the best  prospect  yet for his own return to Palestine, he said: ""We are not  puppets. They have to respect what had been agreed upon and  signed."" He said he had sent messages to the co-sponsors of the  peace process -- the United States and Russia -- as well as to  other permanent members of the UN Security Council and the  European Union asking them to ""start all their efforts for an  accurate and honest implementation"" of the Declaration of  Principles signed at the White House last September.    Mr. 'Arafat appeared tired but confident in immaculate green  battle fatigues as he received journalists at the, for him,  exceptionally early hour of 8.30pm on Friday. He did not rage;  in a display of relaxed showmanship, he insisted that he was not  optimistic. ""I am sorry to say, no. It's very difficult to say  it, but I arrive with my back against the wall now,"" he  declared, raising his hand against the backdrop of a huge  photograph of Jerusalem's Dome of the Rock hanging behind his  desk.    ""I offered all the flexibility and effort but the other side  is not responding. I left my team in Cairo under orders to  continue but I do not know if the Israelis will come back to  finalise or to manoeuvre,"" he said of the talks that reopen  today.    Mr 'Arafat was particularly indignant about two things: The  first, that a week after an agreement signed with Shimon Peres,  Israel's Foreign Minister on 31 March, whereby Israel had agreed  to be ""guided by the target dates"" in the declaration, Israel  had issued a statement saying merely that the negotiations of  Gaza and Jericho may be finalised by the end of this month.  ""May,"" said Mr 'Arafat. ""We were preparing to send an advanced  group of policemen two days ago but the Israelis refused,  putting many excuses.    ""But not only that,"" he added, getting to the bigger bone of  contention. ""They suspended our talks in Cairo because there  was a commemoration of the Holocaust in Israel. Why did they  not suspend the negotiation in the economic committee which is  still continuing in Paris? What does this mean?    ""I have the right to ask, is there one Israeli government or  two? One government which accepts continuing in Paris, and  another which accepts suspending in Cairo?    ""They are not listening to me. They are not listening to  anybody. This is the peace of the braves. We have to be  courageous.""    Time and again, Mr 'Arafat recalled the words of the Israeli  Prime Minister, Yitzhak Rabin, last December -- ""There are no  sacred dates"" -- implicitly contrasting that with the Israeli  decision to leave the talks to attend a Holocaust memorial at  home. ""It is unbelievable, believe me, unbelievable."" Even  more so because Mr Peres had ""accepted to return back the next  day and to send a delegation, and then he gave me these  statements of the delay.    ""If it was the first manoeuvring, OK, we could let it pass.  But there has been manoeuvring, manoeuvring, manoeuvring,  manoeuvring. For how long? Not to forget: I was in Washington  in September and nothing has been achieved on the ground. They  are destroying the peace process by this manoeuvring. The whole  credibility of the peace process has been lost.""    Asked about calls within his ranks for a less autocratic  style of leadership, Mr 'Arafat declared: ""The PLO is one of  the democratic oases in the Middle East."" He could not resist a  jibe at criticisms from salon Palestinians such as Edward Said  the academic based in New York: ""More democracy, yes, when we  are in our own state. Not when we live in the United States,  away from our people's daily needs.""    Mr 'Arafat cautioned that further delays would lead to an  escalation of extremist acts on both sides. On fundamentalism  in general, he issued a covert warning to the US to learn from  past mistakes: ""This is part of what happened in Afghanistan.  Do not forget how these fanatic groups were trained, armed and  financed -- and here we are. It is not me who has done it. It  is the American administration. They gave all kinds of support.  Remember? So here we are-the shadow of what was done in  Afghanistan.""    This was also an oblique reference to allegations that the  United States' ally, Saudi Arabia, is financing fundamentalist  groups across the Middle East. ""If there will be no peace,  there will be complete confusion in this area, in thc most  strategic area in the world -- confusion and Balkanisation.""  Asked when he thought he might be able to take up the reins in  Jericho, he said: ""I can't give you an answer because, as you  see, I was supposed to be there since last December. But the  Israelis have delayed the peace accord.""    Both the West and extremists such as Hamas should take heed,  however: ""I am the leader of the Palestinian people, not of  Fatah or Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement], or the Popular  Front, or the Arab Front, or any other organisation. I am the  leader of the Palestinian people according to three elections in  the Palestine National Council.""    At their Cairo meeting in December, Mr Rabin had promised to  return within 10 days and had still not done so. Mr 'Arafat  recalled the words of Egypt's President, Husni Mubarak: ""Next  time I will close one of these villas till the white smoke  appears."" Mr 'Afarat concluded: ""It seems the Israelis do not  want the white smoke to appear.""    ""It is my duty now to call upon the co-sponsors, the  international community and the Security Council... to bear  their responsibility and not to leave me alone.""     "

We will tackle the situation, but we  cannot do anything without the political will of both the  government and UNITA. I still believe that both the government  and UNITA have opted for dialogue. These derailments and  confusion are deplorable, but we will do our best to cope with  the situation.""    Beye did not elaborate.

Mr Milosevic yesterday agreed to round-table talks with his political opponents, but a delegation representing the protesters gathered outside the Yugoslav parliament indicated after talks with the president that they may not accept anything short of his resignation, 'The president of Serbia accepted round-table talks and a test of his presidential mandate in elections or a referendum,' the five-man delegation told the crowd in a brief statement after the one-hour meeting. The president, a nationalist and former communist, has stubbornly ignored pressure to resign, and his opponents' demands for more democracy, peace and a change of policy to escape from almost total international isolation.

[Jovanovic] Good day.    [Colovic] A lot of hullabaloo is being raised these days on  the occasion of the NATO summit in Brussels because of the  threats of air raids on Serbian positions in Bosnia. What do  these threats mean?    [Jovanovic] They are a part of the total, rather incoherent  approach by NATO and the leading Western powers to the Bosnian  crisis. Hiding behind this is their indecision as to whether it  is more in their interest for peace to be immediately  established in Bosnia or for sanctions against Yugoslavia to be  continued. This indecision or, how shall I put it, failure to  show complete determination is being skillfully used by the  Muslim side in Bosnia (?and) the Islamic bloc of countries to  strengthen the war option. As regards NATO, the positive thing  in its stand is the orientation toward a political solution to  the dispute as the only road that can be followed in the future.    However, this positive orientation toward negotiations and a  political solution to the crisis is not supported by an explicit  and definite stand for directly establishing peace in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. This is because the illusion has been  prolonged to the Islamic side in Bosnia and in the world that by  obstructing peace by various procedural reasons and artificial  questions that they can ask subsequently, they can gain more  than by concluding a peace. At the same time, this is the  weakest side in the NATO meeting. As regards those threats that  have been voiced, they express the vestiges of this double  standard and I would say a further divorce from the Bosnian  reality. At the time when the non-Serbian sides in Bosnia are  waging real and very bloody battles against each other, and the  Serbian side in Bosnia is only defending itself from  provocations and attacks from the Muslim side, it is the Serbian  side that is singled out as the target of possible air raids and  the other two are not even mentioned. This is not only a  deviation from reality, but also is not helpful for overcoming  the present military situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina and  accelerating this peace process.    It goes without saying that these threats include many  expressions of disagreement and difference of views on the  interests of many factors within NATO itself. It goes without  saying that they include much tactical political pressure in the  expectation that it will show its worth in Geneva on 18 January  where the Muslim side would subsequently grab some more  territorial concessions apart from those that the plan of action  of the European Union demanded.    [Colovic] Mr. Jovanovic, Yasushi Akashi, special envoy to  the UN secretary general, visited Belgrade yesterday. To what  extent did the talks that Akashi had with Serbian President  Slobodan Milosevic and FRY Prime Minister Kontic help clear up  this question, which is very important and serious for peace not  only in Bosnia?    [Jovanovic] I think that both meetings helped a lot, because  they firmly stuck to the ground, to the facts and the reality,  and started from an uncompromising commitment to a political  solution to the crisis in Bosnia exclusively through peaceful  means. This is a significant correction to the euphoric and  somewhat militant mood that existed in the work of the NATO  meeting and in its final document. On the other hand, it is  also support for the meeting in Geneva on 18 January, where  pleas are being made to mobilize all political efforts on all  sides with a view to finally putting an end to the war in Bosnia  and establishing a final peace.    Mr. Akashi presented himself as an absolutely astute and  responsible person, who attaches high importance to this aim, to  ending peace by peaceful means and establishing peace in the  shortest and quickest way possible. In that respect he engages  the entire authority of the United Nations and its secretary  general in the correct way and with the correct means. In the  talks with our representatives, he could see for himself once  again that Yugoslavia is absolutely a peaceful factor and that  in this respect the United Nations and Mr. Akashi can count on  our permanently constructive cooperation. It goes without  saying that this is cooperation that would take care of the  equality and legitimacy of all three sides in Bosnia-Herzegovina  and would not start from the point that only one, the Serbian  side, should make endless concessions to the others.    [Colovic] Mr. Jovanovic, talks between Croatian President  Tudjman and Muslim President Izetbegovic were held recently. It  appears that they were unsuccessful and were followed by a very  belligerent statement by the Muslim president. Can you explain  this?    [Jovanovic] This can be easily explained. There has been no  adequate reaction to any of the belligerence of the  fundamentalist leadership in Sarajevo on the part of the  international community and particularly on the part of these  who are directly involved in solving the Bosnian crisis. There  has been no adequate reaction on the part of the European Union,  the Security Council, the United Nations, an even on the part of  the two cochairmen, although one must admit that they were most  objective and most direct in observing the negative aspects of  the Bosnian Muslim stance (?thus far). Mr. Izetbegovic is  obviously encouraged by such concessions and at the same time  strongly supported by the Islamic Bloc throughout the world. He  found food for his illusion that by further obstructing peace  and mobilizing every potential with the goal of lifting the  embargo on arms imports -- promised to him by some sides -- he  will be able to radically turn the situation to his own  advantage. This illusion is very dangerous and, as the Italian  foreign minister said a few days ago -- it also represents the  greatest enemy of peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    [Colovic] Finally, you mentioned the continuation of the  Geneva negotiations on 18 January. What can be expected from  this, if I remember correctly, 16th meeting?    [Jovanovic] For a long time, for several months, we have  expected every such meeting to be the last and to put an end to  war and a roof to the building of peace. In this respect our  side -- and I include here the Serbian side in Bosna as well--  has a completely clear conscience. Meanwhile what the world  demanded of us: A joint Serbian-Croatian proposal and  concessions guaranteeing Muslims in Bosnia one-third of the  territory, has been reached, and from that moment on the world  should have been addressing the Muslim side alone. The Muslim  side should finally be told to stop this game of hide-and-seek  with the world and with peace, and state finally whether it is  in favor of peace, as its basic demand has been accepted, or if  it is in favor of war -- so we can know what we are going to  talk about. We think that in Geneva on the 18th, if that  meeting takes place at all, the international community will  talk with the only side that is still obstructing peace in such  an obvious and direct manner.    [Colovic ] Therefore, peace depends on the Muslim side  regardless. Thank you Mr. Jovanovic, on behalf of the listeners  of the ""An Argument More"" program. Thank you very much.    [Jovanovic] Not at all. Thank you and goodbye.     "

Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Mr Shimon Peres, his foreign minister, met Mr Yassir Arafat, leader of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, in Paris yesterday. After their first meeting since their May 4 agreement in Cairo on self-government for Gaza and Jericho, they were due last night to resume their discussions in the French capital. The two sides remain in disagreement over the number of Palestinian refugees displaced by the 1967 war, with Israel apparently putting the number at 200,000; the PLO estimates the number at 860,000. Mr Arafat said his meeting with Israeli leaders had been 'positive and fruitful'. But he called on Mr Rabin to show 'more co-ordination and comprehension' to reinforce the peace agreements, first signed last September in Washington. He said he had raised the issue of Israel's detention of Palestinians and its 'isolation of Jerusalem' from the peace process. Reuter adds from Tunis: A member of the Palestinian authority set up to run the Gaza Strip and Jericho will attend a business meeting in East Jerusalem on July 20, he said yesterday. Mr Ahmed Korei, better known as Abu Ala, who is in charge of economy and trade in the Palestinian authority, said he had accepted an invitation to address a meeting expected to be attended by 500 Palestinian businessmen from the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Last month, one of his colleagues, Mr Nabil Shaath, in charge of international co-operation, gave up a planned visit to Jerusalem after protests by Israeli radicals. King Hussein of Jordan began talks in Cairo with Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak on Amman's accelerated peace process with Israel, due to pick up later in July. Jordanian officials said King Hussein wanted to strengthen his country's ties with Egypt ahead of the first Jordanian-Israeli negotiations later this month.

0,FT911-4070 ,"FT911-4070 _AN-BDVB1AANFT 910422   FT  22 APR 91 / Baker denies putting pressure on Israel      By TONY WALKER and HUGH CARNEGY      CAIRO, JERUSALEM   MR JAMES BAKER, the US secretary of state, yesterday sought to counter reports that he was becoming impatient with Israel and was about to exert stronger pressure to secure its co-operation in his Middle East peace efforts. Speaking after talks with President Hosni Mubarak in Cairo, Mr Baker went out of his way to deny that he was pressing Israel for an immediate answer to his peace proposals. 'We do not intend to press or obviously to pressure for an answer. We understand that it takes some time to consider the suggestions that we made,' he told reporters. But as the US official continued his tour of Middle East capitals, his third visit to the region in six weeks, there was little to indicate progress in his efforts to find common ground between Israel and the Arabs. In Jerusalem, officials also played down reports of differences with the US, and Mr David Levy, the foreign minister, said Mr Baker would return to Israel this week for further talks. Mr Ehud Olmert, the health minister, said suggestions that the US and Israel were on the brink of a confrontation were 'inaccurate and harsh'. Mr Baker last week pressed the Israeli government to accept terms for a proposed regional peace conference that go beyond those Israel was originally prepared to accept. Israeli newspapers reported that the government would reject at least some of Mr Baker's suggestions. But Israel is loath to bring Mr Baker's mission to a halt. It fears losing US backing at the United Nations if the Arab-Israel dispute was referred back to the Security Council. It is also afraid of jeopardising much-needed extra aid to help absorb a wave of Soviet Jewish immigrants. Mr Yitzhak Shamir, Israel's premier, is said to be unhappy with suggestions that the UN and EC should play some role in the proposed regional conference and that the gathering itself should have a function beyond acting as a symbolic 'opening' for negotiations between Israel and the Arabs. Mr Shamir torpedoed a previous attempt by Mr Baker a year ago to advance peace efforts, by saying 'no' to talks with representative Palestinians in Cairo. Israel's refusal to sanction the US-sponsored meeting caused serious friction with Washington. Palestinian representation remains a big stumbling block to attempts to revitalise the peace process. Israel refuses to deal with the 'terrorist' Palestine Liberation Organisation. Mr Baker met Jordan's King Hussein in Aqaba on Saturday - the highest-level meeting between the administration and Jordan since the king swung his support behind Iraq early in the Gulf war. Clearly delighted that the US was proposing to engage him in renewed peace efforts, the king told reporters: 'I believe this is a milestone in relations between our two countries.' The US hopes Jordan can help provide 'cover' for the presence of a Palestinian delegation at any peace conference involving Israel. On Saturday, Mr Baker confirmed reports that Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states would not attend a regional peace conference. Syria, meanwhile, issued a hard-line statement on the eve of Mr Baker's return to Damascus for further talks. The official newspaper Tishreen said any efforts that were not based on UN resolutions calling for Israeli withdrawal from Arab lands and recognition of Palestinian rights would fail.

De Leon compared peace to a train, and sectors that  fail to hop aboard are left at the station. The CACIF has  realized that it must join efforts to reach peace, he added.    As for the petition made by business circles to the Attorney  General's Office that UNRG commanders must be legally  prosecuted, the head of state deemed it somewhat hard to  understand as CACIF is holding talks with the URNG. This shows  peace is more difficult to achieve than war. I want to clarify,  however, that I respect all decisions made by CACIF, he  pointed out.    As for the talks held by conflicting parties on the uprooted  population, the president said he has little to say because  civilian sectors have already made their proposals and the  delegations will make the final decision.    President De Leon also said he was pleased with the visit he  paid to the refugees who returned to Guatemala in the last few  days because he regards them as apolitical Guatemalans, although  some leaders are trying to use or manipulate them.

In a statement to reporters following talks with Serbian  President Slobodan Milosevic in Belgrade, Lord Owen explained  that the agreement called for the deployment of the U.N.  Protection Force (UNPROFOR) between the warring sides.    It is very important for UNPROFOR to be there because that  would reduce the risk of new armed confrontations, Lord Owen  said.    Lord Owen said that progress had been achieved in the talks  with Milosevic and that he now felt there was reason for greater  optimism.    Lord Owen and the other co-chairman of the international  conference on former Yugoslavia, Thorvald Stoltenberg, who was  also present at the meeting with Milosevic, said that there were  three phases in the present diplomatic activities for resolving  the Bosnian crisis.    The first phase begins on Friday when the co-chairmen and  special Russian envoy Vitaliy Churkin will leave for Pale and  Sarajevo, the seat of the Bosnian Serbs and the Bosnian Moslems.    The second phase will be the signing of the peace agreement.    The final phase will begin only after the general cease-fire  agreement is reached. That phase will cover the precise drawing  of maps, the determining of borders between the Serb republic  and the Croat-Moslem federation and the lifting of the  sanctions, Lord Owen said.    The U.N. Security Council imposed comprehensive and binding  sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in late May  1992 because of its alleged involvement in the war of local  Serbs, Croats and Moslems in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Churkin, who joined the talks between the co-chairmen and  Milosevic, explained Moscow's stand on this issue, Lord Owen  said.    Lord Owen said that if they [word indistinct] be partners in  the peace process, then that partnership should not cover only  the drawing of maps, but also the specification of the process  of the gradual suspension of the sanctions.    Prior to today's joint meeting with the co-chairmen, Churkin  met with Milosevic three times in the past 24 hours.     "
0,FT944-3033 ,"FT944-3033 _AN-ELOCSAC4FT 941215   FT  15 DEC 94 / Belfast Investment Conference: Mood that makes peace process hard to derail - Enthusiasm bodes well for talks on the province's future      By JOHN MURRAY BROWN and DAVID OWEN   Politics was never far from delegates' minds during the conference. The hardline Democratic Unionists made an appearance. Even Mr Gary McMichael, a representative for the loyalist paramilitaries, was spotted in the bar. And the walk-out by Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, although a clear disappointment to the government, failed to overshadow proceedings. In the end, the event attracted prominent members of parties from across Ulster's political spectrum, which could augur well for the prospects of the round-table talks which it is hoped will eventually be convened on the future of the province. The sheer buoyancy of the mood and the enthusiasm of the welcome given to Mr John Major and the US commerce secretary Mr Ron Brown suggest the peace process is building to a point where it is increasingly difficult for the main participants, including Sinn Fein, to contemplate staying outside. The conference came at a vital time after long delays in the forming of a new Irish government. This has raised questions about the the nature of Sinn Fein's relationship with the Republic and cast doubt over the progress on the framework document, which the two governments envisage as the basis of all-party talks on the constitutional arrangements for the province. More than anything, the conference has demonstrated Mr Major's personal commitment to maintain the momentum of the peace process. It has also served to underline the practical benefits that will flow from a durable settlement. In outlining a plan for a job creation scheme, Mr Major seemed keen to counter criticism by Sinn Fein that their supporters in the deprived areas of Catholic west Belfast were being ignored by the conference. The programme will do much to underline the government's commitment to address the long-term structural problems of the economy, widely seen as having inflamed community relations. Attention now turns to the talks with the paramilitaries with an exploratory session due to start with the loyalists in Belfast today. On Monday, British officials will meet Sinn Fein for the second time and both sides are expected to draft a more detailed agenda for future exchanges. Observers do not expect the talks to broach any of the contentious issues until at least February - but Mr Major yesterday again stressed the issue of the IRA's large stockpile of weapons and explosives. For the future, much will depend on the outcome of the search for a new coalition in Dublin. Last night, a new three-party coalition seemed about to be announced led by Fine Gael, a broadly conservative party, with Labour and the Democratic Left, replacing the Fianna Fail-Labour coalition which collapsed last month over a judiciary appointment scandal. Traditionally, Fine Gael has been more sympathetic than Fianna Fail to the unionists in Northern Ireland. In exchanges in Dublin's Forum for Peace and Reconciliation last week, Sinn Fein is said to have expressed disapproval for Fine Gael's presentation on the problems of the province. One concern is that Sinn Fein may feel increasingly isolated from politicians in Dublin, which may strengthen the position of hardline republicans opposed to the ceasefire. Equally, Sinn Fein has poor relations with Democratic Left, the successors to the Official IRA, from which the Provisional IRA split in the 1970s to pursue the armed struggle. Sinn Fein has already voiced concern about the likelihood of a Fine Gael-led administration in Dublin and it is clear that any new coalition will still require the support of Fianna Fail if it is to steer vital changes to the constitution through a referendum, as demanded by northern unionists. The recent political crisis has left so much bad feeling between the parties that many observers believe Fianna Fail deputies will be in no mood to co-operate with a Fine Gael-led coalition even on issues as close to their heart as the settlement of the Northern Ireland conflict.

""The government's answers are still a bunch of  papers, and whether it will abide by them remains to be seen.  Peace is far away; there are only promises. We still have to see  what the communities have to say,"" said Marcos. According to  Marcos, the EZLN is not ready to sign peace.    He stated that until now the EZLN talks with Manuel Camacho  Solis, commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas,  have been limited to a dialogue in which ""he has responded to  our 34 demands, but none of them have been negotiated."" He said  the 19 EZLN delegates, who participated in the talks, ""have not  said if we agree with the commissioner's 34 proposals; our  leaders and grassroots communities must say it.""    Subcommander Marcos said the Zapatists do not understand the  government's answers ""because they clash with our languages and  culture. It is impossible to go past the negotiation phase  because we still do not understand; we have to translate their  answers into our perception of the world."" He stated the San  Cristobal de las Casas talks are close to an agreement, which  will later be discussed at the grassroots level, and that the  first round ""will conclude with a document of consultation,""  and after that peace will come.    He recognized Camacho Solis' sincerity in the talks but  wondered to what extent his stance represents the government's.  ""Camacho Solis is telling us what is possible and what is not;  in some ways he is another mediator."" He said there is no  agreement on democracy, one of the chief demands of the  Zapatists, at the talks because the government has refused to  discuss national topics. ""The government has refused to discuss  democracy, refused to discuss amending Article 27, democracy, or  of recognizing the EZLN as a belligerent force, electoral  reform, justice, changes in the economic policy, and reforming  the Free Trade Agreement,"" he indicated.    The top leader of the EZLN reiterated that if President  Carlos Salinas de Gortari does not resign, then there ought to  be ""an electoral change so it is the civilian sector of society  that controls"" the 21 August elections.    The EZLN has not thought of surrendering its weapons because  ""a lot of history remains to be covered. Surrendering of our  weapons is far away, perhaps 500 years away,"" Marcos stated. For  him, remaining armed constitutes a guarantee the government  promises will be kept. He said the Catholic Church has always  opposed Indians taking up arms, even in its role in Chiapas, it  has favored"" a ""collective sentiment of community in the  Christian sense.""     "
0,FT923-9423 ,"FT923-9423 _AN-CHGBIADUFT 920805   FT  05 AUG 92 / Drive begins to end war in Mozambique      By JULIAN OZANNE      NAIROBI   THE biggest effort yet to solve poverty-stricken Mozambique's 16-year civil war gets under way in Rome today where President Joaquim Chissano is due to meet his rebel opponent for the first face-to-face peace talks. Observers say there is a new-found sense of realism on both sides at the talks, born of a recognition that Mozambique and its 15m people simply cannot take another year of fighting, famine and destruction. The success of the talks is critical to averting widespread starvation caused by the worst drought in Mozambique's history but exacerbated by the war which has made 70 per cent of the country insecure, and has forced at least 4m people to flee their homes. The outcome of the talks is also vital to efforts to resuscitate Mozambique's aid-dependent economy where average per capita income is less than Dollars 80 and where Mr Chissano says half the country's people cannot feed themselves. Hopes are high that after two years of failed talks, the warring sides, tired by fighting and the suffering inflicted on their people, may now be prepared to reach agreement. The optimism is boosted by the involvement in the talks of President Mugabe of Zimbabwe and the foreign ministers of Italy and Botswana. A critical role is also being played behind the scenes by the European Community, the United Nations and Mr Tiny Rowland, the chief executive of Lonrho, which has substantial but unfulfilled agro-industrial commercial interests in Mozambique. However, the same nagging obstacles which have defeated eleven rounds of peace talks held over the past two years remain as formidable as ever. Renamo, the right-wing rebel group led by Mr Afonso Dhlakama, has little in the way of a political programme to present as a basis of dialogue. It was originally formed and supported by the Rhodesian secret service in 1974 to combat the communist black nationalist Frelimo party, which swept to power in Mozambique a year later. After Zimbabwean independence in 1980, South Africa continued the military and logistical support of Renamo as part of its destabilisation and sabotage campaign in hostile neighbouring states. Throughout this period, Renamo never tried to build a mass popular base, like other rebel insurgencies, but adopted tactics of sabotage and terrorism against civilians. The end of the Cold War, the abandonment of communism by Frelimo and introduction of liberal political and economic reforms followed by the changes in South Africa have left Renamo an anachronism. However, now backed by right-wing extremists in Portugal and South Africa, it has continued its campaign of terror and destruction. Fears are also widespread that one of the reasons Mr Dhlakama has been reluctant to speed the peace process is that he may not exercise control over his troops, many of whom are no more than marauding bandits. Efforts to reach a successful ceasefire between the two sides as a prelude to political dialogue has broken down over Renamo's demand that the Frelimo government withdraw an estimated 5,000-7,000 Zimbabwean troops stationed in Mozambique to guard trade routes and an oil pipeline between the two countries.

0,FT944-18088 ,"FT944-18088 _AN-EJED5AD2FT 941005   FT  05 OCT 94 / United in wishful thinking: The Northern Irish seem fairly optimistic - but disappointments may lie ahead      By EDWARD MORTIMER   As you leave the Bogside (or 'Free Derry') and drive towards the centre of the city, which road signs elsewhere in Northern Ireland still call Londonderry, a striking mural confronts you. It shows a back view of British soldiers walking into the distance, past a signpost clearly marked 'London'. Seventy odd miles away is another mural, painted on the side of a house facing into the Shankill Road, a long finger of militant Protestantism thrust defiantly into Catholic west Belfast. It is literary rather than pictorial: '1969 IRA ran away. 1994 IRA surrendered.' So both sides have won. Or think they have. Or want you to think they have. Or are trying to convince themselves that they have. Or perhaps a mixture of all of the above. If there is one common feature which just now seems to unite almost all factions in both parts of Ireland, it is wishful thinking. Almost but not quite all factions - at least not if Dr Conor Cruise O'Brien, the former UN envoy and Irish cabinet minister, can be considered a faction. He greeted the IRA ceasefire on August 31 with a series of dire predictions in British newspapers, culminating in a chronology of disasters that included half a million refugees and 10,000 fatal casualties in a civil war ending 'in stalemate with a smaller but entirely Protestant Northern Ireland'; a military coup in Dublin; and explosions in several British cities - all by the end of 1995. I could not find anyone in Belfast or Dublin last week who would admit to believing in the whole of this scenario, but several people asked me what I thought of it, as though anxious to be reassured. In my turn I asked Mr John Bruton, leader of the main opposition party in Dublin, Fine Gael, what he thought. The nightmare was possible, he replied; but 'on average you don't have a nightmare every night. The likelihood is that it won't occur. The role of people like Dr Conor Cruise O'Brien is to prove themselves wrong by warning in time of the danger.' Many of the Northern Irish Protestants I met admitted to being more optimistic now than when the ceasefire was announced. The suspicion of a secret deal between the IRA and the British government has largely faded. Indeed, many express a degree of confidence in the British prime minister seldom heard on the mainland. His pledge of a referendum on any new arrangement for Northern Ireland is welcomed by unionists and generally believed. Even his rough treatment of the Reverend Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionist party, seems to have paid off: several Protestants expressed embarrassment about Mr Paisley's behaviour, while the only person who criticised Mr John Major's reaction was a southern Irish diplomat. There could, however, be a psychological explanation for this unexpected surge of unionist confidence in the British government. As Professor Paul Bew, a political scientist at Queen's University, pointed out: 'It's very uncomfortable for unionists to believe in a sell-out, because if you really did believe that you'd have to prepare for a very unpleasant conflict.' The fact is that IRA violence against British and Protestant targets has completely ceased since August 31, and that that is a great relief to the people. Mentally they remain on their guard, but emotionally they cannot help relaxing a bit. Obviously it is nicer to think this relaxation has a good chance of becoming permanent than to prepare for a reversion to violence and insecurity in weeks or months. The only thing unionists have ever had to hope for, all through the long years of violence, is that one day the IRA would realise the futility of the 'armed struggle'. Once they begin to think that that day might have arrived, the attraction of the thought becomes irresistible. But of course the thought has to be rationalised. Evidence of some sort has to be found. It is found, paradoxically, in the very success and publicity which the IRA's switch to a 'peace strategy' has enjoyed. Particularly for the Sinn Fein leaders, this conversion is seen as having produced such dividends in the shape of applause and respectability on both sides of the Atlantic that it seems hardly conceivable they would sacrifice it all by switching back to violence. I found many people disposed to take Mr Gerry Adams's statement to the Boston Herald last week at face value, when he said no one could guarantee 'two or three years up the road that if the causes of conflict aren't resolved another IRA leadership won't come along'. In other words, people accept that Mr Adams and his colleague, Mr Martin McGuinness, are now personally identified with the new strategy to the point where, for them at least, there is no going back. It was to see Mr McGuinness that I went to 'Free Derry'. Needless to say, he does not think the IRA has surrendered. Republicans, he said, were now 'totally and absolutely committed to the peace process', but their decision, which had 'totally transformed the situation on this island', was 'taken from a position of considerable strength'. Was there a danger that the 'peace process' could fail, I asked. Yes, he said. 'In Ireland there is danger all the time. But I am not in any way at all looking at this from a pessimistic point of view. We have a very real opportunity to resolve this conflict.' Permanent? 'Nothing in life is permanent,' said Mr McGuinness. It was all up to the British government. 'Since August 31 they have removed the broadcasting ban and reopened a handful of cross-border roads, while keeping the vast majority closed. Most people regard that as a measly response. There is a very real danger of the momentum being lost.' I asked what kind of solution to the conflict he envisaged. 'No party will go on record on its bottom line before a negotiation,' he replied. 'Of course our preferred solution is a unitary state, a united Ireland. Other parties to the negotiations will have a different view. But the key thing is acceptance by the British government that at some time in the future Britain will end its jurisdiction, even if that is some way down the road. When the British government accepts that inevitability, it will be a matter for all the Irish parties to work out the structures.' Slightly twisting the words of the Downing Street Declaration, Mr McGuinness claimed that document already contained 'a clear acceptance by the British government that the solution has to be an island-of-Ireland solution'. Britain, he said, had undertaken to 'facilitate' such a solution, but the onus was on it to go one step further and 'persuade' the unionists. 'Once the unionists accept that the British government is involved in a process of disengagement, it becomes a matter for the people of Ireland. Psychologically, once the British government makes it clear to the unionists, you're talking about a very fertile field.' The 'worst scenario', he conceded, 'would be that elements of unionism would try to rebel. In that case the British government should have the will to confront people who disrupt the process.' He brushed aside my suggestion that, having once agreed to withdraw, Britain would be more likely to get on and do so, leaving the Irish of all persuasions to fight it out. When I said that in the same declaration, Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, had agreed to give the majority in Northern Ireland the final say on sovereignty, Mr McGuinness replied: 'We would totally disagree with that.' Why, he asked, should 900,000 unionists have the right to overrule 600,000 nationalists in Northern Ireland, when 'on the island there are 3 1/2 m other people with a keen interest', not to mention 'many millions' in Britain itself who, he claimed, 'believe the British government should disengage'. 'It's not fair,' he concluded, 'to give the destiny of Ireland solely over to those 900,000 people, as opposed to the feelings and wishes of all the others.' Nor would he accept that in a united Ireland the northern Protestants would form a minority at least as disgruntled as the northern Catholics now are in the UK. 'Nothing could be further from the truth. Many political parties in the 26 counties (ie the south) are not too far distant from them: the Progressive Democrats, Fine Gael, the Democratic left.' Together with these allies, he suggested, the unionists might well form a government 'in a totally new Ireland'. He did not seem to realise that, if some unionists do regard the southern parties he named as allies, it is because those parties accept, more clearly and less equivocally than the Irish government, that Northern Irish Protestants have a distinct culture and history, and have the right to remain in the UK. But what, I asked, if Britain and the unionists are not so obliging? How long would the IRA tolerate a deadlock? 'I can't speak for them,' said Mr McGuinness coyly. 'But Sinn Fein is committed to the peace process. We shall be very disappointed if the British government doesn't speak with Sinn Fein very soon. The talks need to begin now.' On its side, the government's position is that 'exploratory' talks will be held within three months, after it has sufficient indications that the IRA intends the ceasefire to be permanent, and there has been 'a period of verification'. My impression is that the period of verification has already begun, and that the government is waiting less for a specific form of words from the IRA than for a feeling that unionist opinion is ready. Britain is certainly bothered, as is Mr Bruton in Dublin, by the fact that the IRA does not regard the 'cessation of violence' as affecting the methods it uses to enforce order within its own constituency. The only change is that the presumed delinquents' legs and arms are now broken with iron bars instead of their knee caps being shattered by a gunshot. These 'punishment beatings' are apparently popular in areas where the Royal Ulster Constabulary makes few attempts to deal with common law crime. But, as Mr Bruton said, 'an organisation that has to maintain that sort of intimidation in its own area cannot be said to be fully committed to democratic politics'. He professed to hope that his own government 'will put sufficient pressure on Sinn Fein to remedy those situations' - which sounds like more wishful thinking. Another area of uncertainty is the future of loyalist violence. Everyone tells you, including their quasi-official spokesman, Mr David Ervine, that the loyalists are 'close' to deciding on a ceasefire. But Mr Ervine added that they were held back by a 'lingering fear' that the Framework Document for new inter-party talks, on which London and Dublin are working, would contain 'something fearful for unionists' - meaning something that opens the way to Northern Ireland's detachment from the UK and its creeping annexation by Dublin. Mainstream unionists seem more confident that this will not be the case, pointing to the delay in producing the document (now expected in November) as evidence that London is resisting pressure from Dublin. The one thing that is certain is that no one in Northern Ireland will welcome the Framework Document when (or if) it does appear. It is bound to attract unionist suspicion, while falling short of even moderate nationalist hopes, let alone those expressed by Mr McGuinness. Moreover, as a spokesman for Mr John Hume's nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party candidly said, 'anybody welcoming it would be mad', since they would thereby give the other side a reason to reject it. Such is the nature of Northern Irish politics, which the non-violent parties and the British well understand. But the IRA and the loyalist paramilitaries have their own way of registering disappointment when something falls short of their expectations. The Framework Document will surely disappoint one of them, and probably both. At that point, some of Dr Conor Cruise O'Brien's nightmares may start coming true.

0,FT932-14967 ,"FT932-14967 _AN-DDPB8AARFT 930416   FT  16 APR 93 / Major and Owen reject Bosnia arms call      By ROBERT MAUTHNER   MR John Major, the British prime minister, and Lord Owen, one of the international mediators for a peace agreement in Bosnia, yesterday rejected suggestions that supplying arms to the Moslems would help resolve the year-old conflict there. Mr Major, answering a parliamentary question, said the weapons flow to all sides should be cut off rather than increased. The US has said that a partial lifting of the United Nations arms ban to help the Moslems defend themselves against Serb attacks was under consideration to put pressure on the Bosnian Serbs to sign the peace plan drawn up by Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen. The public endorsement of such a step earlier this week by the former British prime minister, Lady Thatcher, has provoked a political debate in Britain about the need for the international community to take more decisive action to stop Serb aggression. Escalation of the debate came as Serbs last night launched a heavy assault on the besieged Moslem town of Srebrenica in east Bosnia, according to Bosnian radio. The defenders were said to have been pushed to within 2km of the town. Lord Owen said in a BBC radio interview: 'The whole European Community takes the view that lifting the arms embargo is not the right priority at this stage and that the fundamental thing is tightening sanctions' against the rump Yugoslav federation of Serbia and Montenegro, Speaking after talks in London with Mr Reginald Bartholomew, the US special envoy to the peace talks, Lord Owen said the danger of arming the Moslems was that it would unleash an armaments race. At a meeting later yesterday with Mr Douglas Hogg, a British Foreign Office Minister, Mr Bartholomew was understood to have accepted that a decision to lift sanctions would inevitably increase the fighting. Mr Bartholomew, who later had talks with Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the Defence Secretary, and Mr Hogg agreed that everything possible should be done to ensure that a resolution to tighten economic sanctions against Serbia should be pushed through the Security Council later this month, if the Bosnian Serbs had still not signed the Vance-Owen plan.

As a  leader of the Palestinian opposition, how do you view the summit?    [Hawatimah] The Geneva summit has once again emphasized that  U.S. Middle East policy still operates on a double standard.  The U.S. President announced that he was for a comprehensive  and just solution in accordance with the resolutions of  international legitimacy. But when it comes to the tangible  agenda, we immediately notice the use of double standards. The  U.S. Administration is ready to do that on the Golan front,  Lebanon, and the occupied Jordanian territories. The same also  applies to the occupied Palestinian territories.    This was clear in the Geneva summit talks, and was also  tackled during the al-Asad-Clinton news conference. Clinton  stressed his administrations' commitment to international  legitimacy and the principle of land for peace regarding the  Golan, southern Lebanon, and Jordanian territories, but he  adopted the Oslo accord, which conflicts with the resolutions of  international legitimacy. Replying to questions on settlement in  the occupied territories, he said that these territories were  disputed areas, in conflict with Resolutions 242 and 338 and  with other Security Council resolutions.    This double standard was also clear when he replied to a  question on implementing Security Council resolutions on Iraq,  while Israel ignored Resolutions 242 and 338. He used two  standards--the standard of the heavy club and comprehensive  destruction for Iraq and the standard of bypassing everything  that might embarrass Israel. At the same time, he left the door  open for the settlement process, which was condemned by Security  Council resolutions as illegitimate and illegal, in addition to  turning the Palestinian territories into disputed areas.    The Syrian side adhered to a comprehensive withdrawal in  return for peace and to the unity of all the tracks in the peace  process, because all the occupied territories are Arab and are  subject to international resolutions. This shows the big  mistake 'Arafat made when he moved from secret talks in  Washington to secret talks in Oslo, struck a partial agreement,  and accepted all the Israeli peace conditions without regaining  an inch of land. He approved the Oslo accord and recognized  Israel's right to exist in accordance with Rabin's conditions,  as well as normalization and security and economic cooperation,  without getting anything in return. This conflicts with the  principle of land for peace.    This reveals the extent of the crime committed by the Oslo  team when it accepted all the Israeli conditions. Thus, the  Palestinian territories became, as Clinton and Israel put it, a  disputed area in violation of the principle of land for peace.  Regarding the Gaza-Jericho agreement, pressure is being  exercised in the Taba talks regarding secondary issues like the  crossing points, the redeployment of the occupation forces, and  the areas that will not be controlled by the Israeli forces, as  well as the alternative Palestinian conditions. All these  secondary issues will fall, and insistence on the principle of  land for peace will survive. This necessarily requires the  cancellation of the Oslo accord and the return to the peace  negotiations based on international legitimacy and halting the  settlement process. Israel is drawing up plans to make a  complete geographic and demographic change in Arab East  Jerusalem in two years, after which no Arab East Jerusalem land  will be left for negotiations. In addition, the settlement  process is going on in the West Bank and Gaza. Therefore, we  have warned against falling into the trap of recognition,  normalization, and security and economic cooperation, which are  Israel's peace terms, without securing withdrawal from occupied  Palestinian territories in accordance with Resolution 242 and  other Security Council resolutions and without solving the issue  of the refugees in accordance with UN Resolution 194.    [Mansur] Nothing has yet been implemented from the  Gaza-Jericho agreement. Will there be an Israeli withdrawal, or  will things remain the way they are?    [Hawatimah] Even 'Arafat himself could not drink the poison  of the Gaza-Jericho agreement and is trying to escape from it,  using superficial issues. We therefore call for that agreement  to be annulled; for a return to the home of national unity,  which is the strongest weapon in our hands against occupation  and settlement; and for the negotiating equation to be rebuilt  on the basis of the land-for-peace formula, which is the  complete opposite of the Oslo formula.    After the Geneva summit, the Israeli Government is playing  two very serious games, and we warn against them. First, the  Israeli Government's statement on declaring Syrian sovereignty  over the Golan Heights in return for a clear Syrian statement on  readiness to accept normalization, the exchange of diplomatic  and commercial ties, and the opening of borders. We remind  everyone of the success Israel achieved by pushing 'Arafat to  such a statement. Israel has managed to get all Israeli  conditions without relinquishing an inch of land. We also  remind everyone of the example of southern Lebanon. Since 1978,  Israel been making statements about Lebanese political  sovereignty over south Lebanon, saying that it does not covet a  single inch. However, Israeli occupation has continued since  then.    Declaring Syria's political sovereignty over the Golan  Heights is similar to the Israeli declarations on Lebanese  sovereignty over south Lebanon. Israel must recognize the  principle of withdrawal and then set a timetable for that  withdrawal.    The example of south Lebanon is flagrant. For 15 years,  Israel has been declaring that Lebanon has political sovereignty  over south Lebanon -- that is probably why it set up the South  Lebanon Army. Israel has also been stating that it does not  covet a single inch of Lebanese territory or a drop of Lebanese  water. However, it has been more than 15 years and we have  still not seen Israel withdraw its occupation troops from a  single inch of south Lebanon in compliance with Resolution 425.    Therefore, the Arab states should learn from the south  Lebanon experience and from the deep abyss into which the  advocates of the Olso agreement have fallen. The Arab states  should not fall in the trap of a declaration of political  sovereignty over their territory in exchange for normalization  and ties because this means accepting the Israeli conditions  without withdrawal from a single inch of the occupied Arab  territories. South Lebanon is an example. They should also  not fall in the Oslo agreement abyss -- to accept normalization  in return for farfetched illusions.    We also warn the Arab states against attempts to deal with  the Oslo team. The Tunis team is now trying to involve itself  again in the Washington talks. Washington is now pressing to  promote the Tunis team and the agreement on the separate  Gaza-Jericho agreement by inviting that team to Washington  despite the fact that it has no work there. This team already  has an agenda for negotiations over proposals for choosing a  self-rule administrative council. The real objective for that  team's trip to Washington is to provide a cover for the Oslo  agreement, which is now drowning, and to give it an umbrella by  the cordon states.    Israel's second dangerous game is its threat to put the  question of withdrawal from the occupied Golan Heights, south  Lebanon, and Jordanian territory to a referendum. These are  occupied territories that should be vacated as provided for by  UN Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338. Under a referendum,  the Israeli public opinion would be in a position to override UN  resolutions. The principle of referendum lends the Golan  Heights, south Lebanon, and Jordanian territory the status of  disputed rather than occupied land, the future of which would be  a matter for the Israeli public opinion. The Israelis are thus  extending the crime committed by the Oslo agreement to other  Arab fronts. The Oslo agreement has, virtually, turned the  occupied Palestinian land into disputed territory. This is  because the agreement satisfies Israel's peace terms even before  it ceded a single inch of land or acceded to the principle of a  pullout from the occupied Palestinian territory as envisaged by  UN resolutions.    [Mansur] The Israeli Government has hinted that unless  'Arafat accedes to Israel's terms, it will quicken the pace of  the talks with Syria. What do you think?    [Hawatimah] This is not the first time that Israel has  sought to use intra-Arab contradictions to its advantage and  capitalize on parochial and isolationist attitudes in the Arab  arena. The idea is to promote its occupation of Arab land.  Israel has applied the same tactic since the sixth round of the  bilateral Washington talks. In August, 1992, the Israelis  created the impression that the road was clear for progress on  other tracks by way of getting the Palestinian leadership in  Tunis to run after secret talks in Oslo behind the backs of  'Arafat's negotiating team in Washington. Let's remember that  the Washington negotiators were mostly unwilling to make the  kind of astonishing concessions 'Arafat was pressing Haydar  'Abd-al-Shafi to make. Throughout the negotiating exercise in  Madrid, Washington, and Oslo the Palestinian and other Arab  peoples were kept in the dark. What took place in Oslo were  secret negotiations held behind the backs of the Washington team  and Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi, who began to balk at the considerable  amount of concessions the Tunis leadership wanted him to make.    The Arab parties must beware of these Israeli tactics.  Otherwise, they will fall one after another and be made to go  along with Israel's terms for a settlement, without any of the  UN resolutions stipulating an Israeli pullout from the occupied  Palestinian territory being honored.    [Mansur] Some say that the U.S.-Syrian Geneva summit will  lead to a peace agreement between Syria and Israel. As a leader  of the Palestinian opposition, how much room will you have to  operate on Syrian territory?    [Hawatimah] Whether Syria reaches an agreement or not, this  is Syria's business. We hope that narrow regional interests and  views will not take precedence over the common national and  pan-Arab interests of our people to struggle to end the  occupation, dismantle the settlements, exchange land for peace,  and implement the resolutions of international legitimacy. Such  befuddling arguments have been going on for years. They will  continue after the Geneva summit.    Those who try to depict the situation as if the Palestinian  movement depends on administrative offices in the Arab capitals  are under a great illusion. Whether these administrative  facilities remain or go, this will not affect the genuine  Palestinian democratic forces that call for a balanced and  comprehensive peace on the basis of full withdrawal in return  for full peace. Actually, some of these facilities are no  longer provided. For us in the DFLP, this is a very minor  issue. We exist within the organizational, popular, political,  professional, and armed ranks of our people inside the occupied  Palestinian territory and in the diaspora. Our offices exist  inside the hearts of the people, their homes, and in several  social, trade, and professional institutions in the occupied  territories, which have been in existence for over 25 years.  Our people's camps in the diaspora are the arenas in which our  organizations operate. Also, the homes in the camps are our  offices. It is useful to have administrative facilities in the  Arab capitals. However, should some constraints be imposed on  us, this will not affect us. This is a minor issue, because the  democratic and nationalist forces of opposition exist in the  occupied territories, the camps, and the diaspora, and not in  administrative offices in this or that capital.    [Mansur] Dr. Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi is now leading an  opposition movement for democratic reforms in the PLO. What can  you tell him?    [Hawatimah] I have said, and I say again, that we welcome  the person who discovered 'Arafat's dictatorship 26 months late.  We tell him that if he really wants to democratize PLO  institutions, make collective decisions, and reestablish  Palestinian national unity, then he should join the democratic  and nationalist opposition, spearheaded by the DFLP. Now, we  have a unified central command for the 10 factions. We will  operate by having reference to popular legitimacy at conferences  at home and abroad and by electing leaders from the base to the  top by democratic means.    I tell Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi that his major mistake was that  after the eighth round of the peace talks, he did not declare a  halt to the bilateral talks and boycott the multilateral talks.  'Abd-al-Shafi made another mistake when he traveled to Tunis.  He came back sad and disappointed. He said that he was sure  this time that the decision was in the hands of one person.  Therefore, he can now return to the people and the masses,  along with us.     "

Our correspondent Joao Ligio has further details.    According to observers here in Lusaka, the course of the  peace talks has reached such a stage that only a greater  international intervention can give it a favorable image. The  two parties view any concessions at this period as capitulation.    On the remaining points on national reconciliation, a few  days ago UNITA received the government proposal on its peaceful  integration in the nation's political life. UNITA has not yet  given its final reply.    On the news media, UNITA does not say yes or no to the  integration of its radio, the Voice of Resistance of the Black  Cockerel, according to the existing legislation. It says  however that it intends to maintain its editorial line.    On the return of property, it says that it is waiting for  new  guidelines from its leadership, because it does not agree with  the way it would be processed.    On the reimposition of the state administration, UNITA wants  eight provinces and 50 districts in central and southern Angola,  with the exception of Lunda Norte and Uige, to fall under its  administration. The government does not want to be diverted  from the legal framework.    Before concluding discussions on national reconciliation,  the  parties are also expected to discuss UNITA's role in national  and local administration and Jonas Savimbi's status.     "
0,FT934-3985 ,"FT934-3985 _AN-DLGD5AAYFT 931207   FT  07 DEC 93 / Arafat insists Israelis stick to deadline      By JULIAN OZANNE and JAMES WHITTINGTON      JERUSALEM, AMMAN   Rising Arab-Jewish bloodshed and deepening tension between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation threatened the Israeli-Palestinian peace process yesterday as Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman, insisted Israel stick to a deadline six days away for the start of military withdrawal. One Palestinian and two Israelis were shot dead in separate incidents of violence. Mr Arafat's demand that Israel keep its promise and start withdrawing troops from the occupied Gaza Strip and West Bank area of Jericho next Monday was rejected yesterday by Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, who said a delay of two to three weeks was inevitable because both sides have yet to reach agreement on security, military and economic issues. Israel meanwhile welcomed two humanitarian gestures made by Syria, which will grant exit permits to Syrian Jews and co-operate in the search for seven missing Israeli soldiers. The moves were widely interpreted in Jerusalem as confidence-building signs of progress on the stalled Israeli-Syrian peace talks, which are the focus of current Middle East shuttle diplomacy by Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state. In Amman Mr Arafat, who met Mr Christopher yesterday, said he had asked the US to put pressure on Israel to meet its obligations under the Israeli-Palestinian peace accord and start a phased troop withdrawal next Monday. Mr Christopher called for 'timely implementation'. Mr Arafat's insistence on the December 13 deadline follows a week of violence between Israelis and Palestinians amid fears that extremists on both sides are stepping up tension. Yesterday, gunmen fired on an car, killing two Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank town of Hebron. Israeli undercover troops shot dead a Palestinian as he sat in front of his house in a West Bank village. In Cairo, where the two sides are discussing military and security issues, Mr Nabil Shaath, chief PLO negotiator, said the talks were at a standstill. The two sides have yet to agree the size of the Jericho area and who will control border crossings. Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, said the two sides were near to agreement providing for Israeli control of the crossings but with a Palestinian presence. In Paris Mr Avraham Shochat, Israel's finance minister, met Mr Ahmed Qurie (also known as Abu Ala) to examine the future relations between Israel and the Palestinian economy. Disagreements focus on an Israeli proposal for a customs union with the harmonisation of taxes and duties. Mr Rabin said the Syrian gesture on Israeli soldiers was 'an important step forward'. After talks with President Hafez al Assad of Syria on Sunday Mr Christopher said Damascus had agreed to help with the search for seven missing Israeli soldiers and to grant exit visas by the end of the year to all Syrian Jews who wished to leave the country. Mr Christopher said he would return to Damascus on Thursday after holding a second round of talks with Israeli leaders this morning.   Countries:-  ILZ  Israel, Middle East.

The announcement came as both the US and the European Union reaffirmed their commitment to support the Northern Ireland economy. In an address to the 300 business delegates at the Belfast conference, the prime minister argued that there were five reasons for investing in the province - the educated labour force; its competitive business costs; one of the most attractive incentive packages on offer in Europe; a strategic location as a bridgehead for US and Asian investors; and its technology infrastructure. Outlining plans for new investments totalling about Pounds 75m, Mr Major reiterated the government's commitment to fair employment. In apparent response to reservations voiced by some US executives about sectarian discrimination in the jobs market, the prime minister said the government was determined to 'correct this legacy'. He added: 'Everyone in Northern Ireland must have equal access to jobs and indeed to all the new opportunities of peace.' The prime minister devoted much of his speech to outlining the new community work programme, aimed at providing work for up to three years for people aged between 26 and 60 who have been out of work for more than a year. The objective was to break the 'vicious cycle of declining skills and motivation which long periods of unemployment can so easily create'. He said: 'Northern Ireland has a new beginning. I want people to see, with the minimum delay, the benefits peace is bringing - to commerce, to industry, to everyday life. 'Peace is giving rise to prosperity. Prosperity in turn will consolidate peace.' The need to underpin the ceasefire through economic measures was a theme echoed by Mr Ron Brown, US commerce secretary. 'At this decisive and hopeful moment, it is essential to create greater economic opportunity in a region whose prospects have been too long dimmed by bloodshed and enmity,' he said. Mr Brown said his presence at the conference was 'only part of a larger ongoing US commitment to Ireland'. The US, he said, was preparing a 'strategic plan' for the economies of both Northern Ireland and the border counties of the Republic. The plan would be presented at President Bill Clinton's investment conference in Philadelphia, scheduled for April, as part of a series of administration initiatives aimed at 'preserving the peace and engendering economic progress'. Mr Carlo Trojan, deputy secretary general at the European Commission, giving further details of the EU's Ecu300m (Pounds 236m) package announced last week, confirmed that the European Investment Bank would extend its interest rate subsidies to help investors in the province. Mr Trojan said the province would require 'significant and sustained investment over the coming years'. Mr Trojan also stressed the need to address structural problems. He said a challenge was 'the redirection of redundant skills especially in the security sector'.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P8331 Job Training and Related Services.

The Vatican encounter was the first by an Israeli prime  minister since an agreement to forge diplomatic ties was signed  in December last year.    Vatican officials said Mr. Rabin renewed his invitation to  the Pope to visit Israel and that the Pontiff accepted saying he  hoped circumstances would allow a pilgrimage to the Holy Land  soon.    Mr. Rabin arrived in Rome today on his way from three days  of  talks in Washington with U.S. President Bill Clinton.    Today's meeting in the Vatican came on the same day that the  Holy See's Secretary for Relations with States, Monsignor  Jean-Louis Tauran, met PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat in Tunis.

He would like to  see a continuation of the negotiations and he would like to see  peace being achieved in the Middle East as he would like to see  it all over the world.

A complete peace treaty has still to be finalised. President Alfredo Cristiani said: 'This agreement initiates a new period for Salvadoreans.' He said his nation, which had suffered 75,000 deaths through the war, could begin spiritual and material reconstruction. Mr Bernard Aronson, US assistant secretary of state, said: 'Both sides know that the war is over.' Mr Aronson, who led a delegation of US officials at the margins of the peace talks, added: 'For the Salvadorean people, it is the best new year's present they could have.' For Mr Javier Perez de Cuellar, who spent the last day of his 10 years as UN secretary-general on December 31 pursuing the peace accord, the agreement was particularly gratifying. 'I am a free man, I feel as light as a feather,' the 71-year-old Peruvian said. The accord draws on a 75-page document which will form the basis of a formal peace settlement in the tiny Central American country of 5m people. Negotiations resume on January 5, either in New York or Mexico. A communique said that if no final agreement was reached the new UN secretary-general, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali of Egypt, would take decisions for the two groups before January 16, when the talks are scheduled to be concluded formally. President Cristiani said remaining issues were 'technical', involving a timetable for implementing the accord, dissolving the rebels' military structure and integrating them into civil life. The Salvadorean president, credited with flexibility in the talks despite criticism from right-wing supporters, said he knew it was not easy for the rebels to agree to the accord. But he said 'the step they have taken will benefit the whole country'. Mr Schafik Handal, one of five rebel commanders, said all accords should begin to be implemented during the official ceasefire period that ends on October 31. If all goes according to schedule, he said, the rebel forces would be demobilised by then. Not all details of the peace settlement were disclosed but both sides involved in the past 20 months of negotiations had already agreed on a reform of the country's judiciary, human rights safeguards, electoral reform, a reduction of the 55,000-member armed forces and an overhaul of security services. The government was said to have presented plans on how to reduce the army over a two-year period to half its size and abolish some paramilitary counter-insurgency battalions. The rebels also wanted the government to allow peasant squatters in areas they control to continue living there. The government instead offered to settle the peasants but not necessarily on private property they now occupied. The agreements apparently call for a special commission to hear individual cases. The existing army-controlled security forces, numbering about 17,000, will be phased out and a new civilian police force is to be created. If the peace accord is implemented, the US has volunteered to be a guarantor of the settlement. It has also offered to initiate a generous reconstruction programme that includes aid from Europe, Canada and Japan. Washington has supported several Salvadorean governments with more than Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.1bn) in financial aid since 1979.  The Financial Times   London Page 2  "
0,FT932-11766 ,"FT932-11766 _AN-DEBAJAAQFT 930501   FT  01 MAY 93 / 'Last chance' talks for Bosnia Serbs      By ROBERT MAUTHNER, Diplomatic Editor   BOSNIA'S Serbs will come under intense pressure at the weekend to accept an internationally-brokered peace plan for Bosnia when they meet leaders of the other warring factions and the presidents of Serbia, Montenegro and Croatia at a two-day summit in Athens. The 'last chance' summit has been called by Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, the United Nations and European Community mediators, amid urgent consultations by the US, its European allies and Russia on the kind of military measures than can be taken to persuade the Bosnian Serbs to endorse the Vance-Owen plan. Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, is due in London tomorrow or Monday for talks with Mr John Major, and Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, which are expected to review all the possible options for further action in Bosnia. With both Britain and France strongly opposed to the selective lifting of the arms embargo on the former Yugoslavia to help the Moslems, it is probable that the talks will concentrate on the feasibility of air strikes against Bosnian Serb supply routes. Following his talks in London, Mr Christopher is scheduled to fly to Moscow on Tuesday, where he will meet President Boris Yeltsin and Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the foreign minister, in a bid to enlist their support for military measures which Moscow has always been reluctant to approve. Mr Christopher's task will be made easier by Mr Yeltsin's recent victory in the Russian referendum, which has weakened the influence of pro-Serbian hardliners in the Russian parliament. 'We are very satisfied with our co-operation with the US,' Mr Vitaly Churkin, the Russian deputy foreign minister, said yesterday. Military action and the continued implementation of tougher sanctions, which formally came into effect earlier this week, can be pre-empted by an agreement between the warring factions in Athens. Mr Vance and Lord Owen firmly believe that President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia holds the key to a solution of the one-year-long conflict in Bosnia. 'We know that the Bosnian Serb fighting forces are fuelled by Yugoslavia,' Lord Owen said in a radio interview yesterday. Yet the mediators nevertheless appear confident that Mr Milosevic, who tried hard to persuade the Bosnian Serbs to accept the Vance-Owen plan last week, will continue to exert the same kind of pressure on them in Athens. 'President Milosevic has decided this is the best settlement he can get. And he has told them (the Bosnian Serbs) straight he is not going to have the whole of Yugoslavia's economy, livelihood, and even safety, put at risk any longer for the Bosnian Serbs,' Lord Owen said. 'Milosevic has a very heavy responsibility to bear for what has happened over the last two years. But he is not an ideologue. He is a pragmatist. I think he has made a pragmatic choice. He is not going to confront the international community.' Lord Owen's optimism appeared to be backed up by US President Bill Clinton who said yesterday that talk of possible use of allied military force may have made the Bosnian Serbs take a second look at a UN-backed peace plan. Meanwhile Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, told reporters in his stronghold of Pale, near Sarajevo, that he believed enough progress could be made in Athens to enable his 'parliament' to accept the peace plan at its meeting on May 5. But he stressed that he did not expect to sign the plan during the weekend summit.   Countries:-  BAZ  Bosnia-Hercegovina, East Europe.   Industries:-  P9711 National Security.

0," LA071189-0088   80734    July 11, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition      Part 1; Page 1; Column 2; Foreign Desk      1521 words      LABOR'S LEADERS VOTE TO BOLT ISRAELI COALITION;    ACTION STEMS FROM DISPUTE OVER PEACE PLAN; WOULD BRING DOWN GOVERNMENT IF  IMPLEMENTED      By DANIEL WILLIAMS, Times Staff Writer      JERUSALEM      Leaders of Israel's Labor Party proposed Monday to withdraw from the ruling  coalition and bring down the government in protest against a toughened stand on  Palestinian elections taken by Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's Likud Party.    Finance Minister Shimon Peres, Labor's party chief, also clarified his own  stand on elections on the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, outlining  positions that directly counter limits set by Shamir. Foremost among his views  is the insistence that Israel be prepared to give up land in exchange for peace  with the Arabs.      A Political Storm    If the threat to break up the coalition is carried out, necessitating new  elections, it would create a political storm here less than nine months after  bitterly fought elections and delicate negotiations gave rise to an uneasy  partnership between rightist Likud and center-left Labor.    A rump session of the Labor Party advisory bureau voted 45 to 2 to leave the  coalition. The bureau is made up of 120 party leaders, most of whom stayed  away, so it is not clear just how united Labor is in its willingness to break  with Likud. Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who voted with the majority, called  for the party to establish its own criteria for Arab elections but to delay for  three weeks any decision on pulling out of the government.    The final decision will rest with Labor's 1,200-member Central Committee. No  date was set for a meeting, leaving time for the back-room compromises  characteristic of Israeli parliamentary crises.    Nonetheless, statements by Peres and other leaders were the fullest expression  of dissatisfaction with Labor's junior role in the Shamir-led government. Since  the coalition was forged last December, numerous members on Labor's left wing  have lobbied to pull out, saying that the stands of the two parties over Middle  East policy are incompatible.    Last week, Likud imposed strict limits on Shamir's plan for elections in the  occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, bringing the contradictions to a head.    ""We will not be a fig leaf for Likud. We will not be a fig leaf for a tragedy,""  said Peres, who invoked a Jewish funeral prayer to add: ""We will not say 'God  full of mercy' over the grave of this peace plan.    ""In view of the latest events, which seriously harmed the government's peace  initiative, it would be proper to . . . dismantle the present government,""  Peres added in a letter that will be sent to Shamir if the Labor Party decides  to pull out.      'Decision Is Final'    ""If there is no peace initiative, the decision is final,"" Peres warned on a  later news broadcast.    Shamir stunned Labor Party leaders by giving in to demands from Likud's right  wing to alter his election plan. Under the original proposal, agreed to by the  coalition government, Arab voters would select delegates to work out a period  of limited autonomy for Palestinians; final disposition of the territories  would be left to later talks.    Under prodding from Ariel Sharon, the hawkish trade and industry minister,  Shamir added several specific conditions: no territorial concessions by Israel,  no participation in the vote by Arabs who live in annexed East Jerusalem, no  talks at all until the Arab uprising ends and yes to more Israeli settlements  on the disputed land.    Since the Likud decision, Shamir has played down the action by portraying it as  a mere confirmation of previously held positions. But Labor Party officials  objected, as did U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III, who termed the  conditions ""not helpful.""    Peres unveiled his own, more liberal conditions Monday. Israel should give up  the occupied land, home to 1.7 million Palestinians, in order to ensure that  the boundaries of Israel would encompass a Jewish majority, he said. ""We are in  favor of territorial compromise if it brings peace,"" Peres stated flatly.    East Jerusalem Arabs could participate in the election, Peres said, although  the vote should not physically take place in the city. The Arab uprising need  not end before talks with Arabs get under way because such a condition would  ""transmit a veto into the hands of extremists.""    Peres called for a halt to construction of five new settlements that Labor and  Likud had agreed to build when they signed the coalition agreement. ""We must  decide that there is no room for the five settlements at this time,"" he said.    Peres, who also holds the title of deputy prime minister, rebuked Shamir for  trying to put limits on topics that elected Palestinians could discuss --  including the desire for an independent state. ""The elections must be  political, with completely free speech,"" he asserted.      'Independent Government'    He spoke in hazy terms of an ""independent government"" that would emerge from  the Arab vote. It was not clear whether he was going beyond Shamir's concept of  limited self-rule for the Palestinians.    Under Peres' election scheme, foreign observers would be welcome to scrutinize  the election. Likud had said there was no need for formal oversight.    Rabin, who first broached the subject of Arab elections, had hoped to delay a  showdown with Likud over details until talks with Arabs were well under way.  But as Labor rose up against the Likud proposals, he too spoke out.    ""The Likud decisions damaged severely the chances of carrying on the peace  initiative,"" he said Monday, challenging Likud to find an Arab partner for  peace.    ""If they can succeed in convincing Arabs to come to negotiate when they are  telling them that (the West Bank and Gaza Strip) will never have foreign  sovereignty, that we will impose our sovereignty upon all the territory, they  are welcome to try,"" he said.    Rabin tentatively outlined his own view of how to create an environment for  Arab elections: a halt to new Israeli settlement of the occupied land, a  commitment to exchange some occupied land for peace with the Arabs and an  agreement to later include Palestinians from abroad in negotiations on a final  settlement -- a condition that could open the way for participation of the  Palestine Liberation Organization.    Likud leaders immediately cautioned Labor against bringing down the government.  Shamir's top aide, Yosef Ben-Aharon, said that Labor should stay on for ""the  benefit of the nation."" Political observers viewed the statement as a means of  reminding Labor that it could bear the blame for toppling the government in a  time of crisis.    Housing Minister David Levy said that Labor had done the Arabs a favor by  creating a ruckus; now, he said, the Palestinians do not have to respond to the  peace plan in any form.    In an unusual departure, the Bush Administration openly intervened by advising  Rabin and Peres not to be too hasty in pulling out of the coalition,  government-run Israel Radio reported. Washington has been trying to find common  ground between the Israeli government and the PLO on settling the Israeli-Arab  conflict. U.S. envoys have attempted to persuade the PLO to endorse some  variation of the election plan in order to get peace talks off the ground.    In turn, Washington has pushed for Israel to be prepared to give up at least  some of the occupied land. The stand put the Administration on Labor's side in  the ultimate test of the peace proposal.    On Monday, Secretary of State Baker said that he will send an envoy to  Jerusalem later this month to ascertain whether the Jerusalem government is  still ""serious"" about seeking peace through Palestinian elections. Baker spoke  to reporters in Poland, where he is part of President Bush's visiting  delegation.    Political analyst Shlomo Avineri foresaw a double-edged dilemma for Labor:  Leaving the government opens the party to an unpredictable electoral test, he  said, but staying in would mean submission to its direct ideological opposite,  the right wing of Likud.    ""My guess is that Labor wants to pressure Shamir to come back to a middle  position,"" Avineri observed.    The mood of the country is considered to have shifted toward a hard-line  position on treatment of the Arabs, at least in the short run. Emotions were  heightened last week when a Palestinian steered a bus off a highway, killing 14  Israeli passengers.    Columnist Aryeh Naor argued that Labor's move presents Shamir with a challenge  to put his party's program into effect or back off once and for all. ""He cannot  keep using the Labor Party to legitimize his program,"" Naor said.    Both analysts viewed the strain in the coalition as the logical conclusion to  an untenable partnership. They pointed out that the previous Labor-Likud  government, formed in 1984, was based on a consensus on dealing with two main  issues confronting the country: disengagement from the war in Lebanon and  reducing runaway inflation.    The present coalition, on the other hand, papered over differences on the main  issue of the day: how to end the 19-month-old Arab uprising and bring peace  between Israel and its Arab neighbors.    ""The chickens are coming home to roost,"" said Avineri. ""As long as no one got  into details, the parties could pretend to go along with each other. But once  specifics were raised, the government was absolutely bound to fall apart.""      Photo, Shimon Peres as he proposed withdrawing from coalition.

Good evening, Mr. Prime Minister.    [Silajdzic] Good evening.    [Hochner] Mr. Prime Minister, the Muslims and Croats have  agreed on a constitution in Vienna but not on a new map. What  will be the next step -- talks on a new map, or talks with the  Serbs on the return of territories?    [Silajdzic] Well, let me tell you first that we are very  glad that these negotiations are taking place in Austria, in  Vienna, because the Austrian Government has spent a great deal  of time and energy on this peace process. To answer your  question, we are not yet discussing maps. We have to talk to  the Serbian side to achieve a final settlement.    [Hochner] It looks as though the Muslims and Croats might  form a military alliance. Can you imagine that Croats and  Muslims might take joint action against the Serbs and recapture  the territories which they claim if no agreement should be  achieved on a new map, for example?    [Silajdzic] We believe that this draft constitution is a  victory for peace and not for war. But everything is possible  after two years of violence. After a very difficult situation  of suffering, everything is possible. Yet, as I said, we  sincerely hope for peace and not for war. We hope that the  human rights mentioned in the draft constitution will have real  meaning -- the right to life, the right to freedom, the right to  free movement, the right to think, and the right to think  differently. We hope that these things will be respected. They  are all stipulated in the constitution.    [Hochner] The Russians have recently intervened in the peace  process in Bosnia. They reportedly cooperate very closely with  the United States. However, there are also fears that a new  East-West border will be established politically in the middle  of your country. How do you assess the influence of the  Russians?    [Silajdzic] Well, I was in Moscow three days ago, and I  openly spoke about our worries concerning this kind of Russian  engagement. We cannot ignore one fact: that Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy visited the occupied part of Bosnia-Herzegovina a  few weeks ago, and that he gave nationalistic and incendiary  speeches. A few weeks later, Russian troops came to Bosnia  without being invited. The Bosnian Government was not  consulted, and the troops were deployed on some lines in  Sarajevo. We are afraid of a division of Sarajevo. We are  afraid of a new Berlin Wall there. We will naturally do  everything possible to prevent another Berlin Wall there. But  we are worried.    [Hochner] The UN embargo against the rest of Yugoslavia  might be used as an instrument to exert pressure on the Bosnian  Serbs. Do you believe that a lifting of the embargo might be  promised to the rest of Yugoslavia to achieve a compromise among  the Serbs in Bosnia?    [Silajdzic] Are you talking about the arms embargo?    [Hochner] I am speaking about the economic embargo.    [Silajdzic] Yes, of course. But that should be done very  cautiously. It must be done strictly in accordance with the  withdrawal. I think that this is the only effective instrument  in the hands of the international community. Unfortunately, the  civilian population is affected by the embargo. That seems to  be inevitable in order to make the Belgrade regime behave.    [Hochner] Let me ask you a final question, Mr. Prime  Minister. The Croats and the Bosnian-Muslim army of the  government waged a bloody war against each other. Negotiations  are now being held. How stable is the new basis of trust between  the two ethnic groups? Do you think it might break again?    [Silajdzic] As I said, everything can happen. Yet a direct  and very important result of these talks is a stable cease-fire,  particularly in Sarajevo and Mostar. This encourages us and  gives us hope to continue. We hope for the best.    [Hochner] Mr. Prime Minister, thank you for the interview.    [Silajdzic] Thank you.     "
0,FT931-17146 ,"FT931-17146 _AN-DACAXAAGFT 930102   FT  02 JAN 93 / Bosnian faction leaders gather for peace talks      By FRANCES WILLIAMS      GENEVA   THE first face-to-face talks between leaders of the three warring factions in Bosnia-Hercegovina since hostilities began last spring open today in Geneva, amid mounting international pressure for outside military intervention to halt Serb aggression. The talks, due to break on Tuesday before resuming later this month, are aimed at thrashing out a political settlement for Bosnia based on the draft constitution prepared by Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, the international mediators, last October. This provides for a decentralised political structure, comprising between seven and 10 largely autonomous provinces based on geographical, economic and historical factors as well as ethnic composition and strong human and minority rights guarantees. Attending today's meeting will be Mr Alija Izetbegovic, president of the mainly Moslem Bosnian government, Mr Mate Boban, the Bosnian Croat leader, and Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader. President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia and President Dobrica Cosic of the rump Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) will also be represented. While the politicians discuss Bosnia's constitutional future, and in particular where the provincial boundaries should be drawn, their military advisers will continue talks begun under UN auspices in the Bosnian capital, Sarajevo. These will focus on the demilitarisation of the city, a reduction of hostilities throughout Bosnia and a lifting of the siege on Moslem-held towns. Expressing fears that talk of military intervention could undermine the Geneva negotiations, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, United Nations secretary-general, this week described today's historic meeting as a 'last chance' for the peace process. However, Mr Vance and Lord Owen are said to see it as a 'first chance' for top-level negotiations between the protagonists, in which a Bosnian settlement would pave the way for a broader regional accord. The talks, which are the culmination of four months of painstaking peace-broking by Mr Vance and Lord Owen, follow last month's elections in Serbia which confirmed hardline President Slobodan Milosevic in power, and the reluctant acquiescence by Mr Izetbegovic to sit down at the same table as Mr Karadzic whom he (and the US administration) labels a war criminal. The Bosnian government and Bosnian Croats are said to have moved closer in talks last weekend to drawing provincial boundaries, and Mr Vance and Lord Owen will have their own map in readiness to move the bargaining process along.

0," LA021489-0088   18432    February 14, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition      Part 1; Page 1; Column 5; Foreign Desk      1245 words      ORTEGA OFFERS TO HOLD EARLY VOTE IN 1990      By RICHARD BOUDREAUX, Times Staff Writer      EL ZAPOTE, El Salvador      Nicaragua's Sandinista leadership, under pressure from Central American  neighbors to ease its tight control of the country, offered Monday to hold next  year's general elections at least nine months ahead of schedule.    Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega made the announcement in a closed meeting  with the presidents of four other Central American countries here. He told them  that the voting scheduled for November, 1990, will instead take place within  the first months of next year.    Manuel Espinoza, the Nicaraguan minister of information, who briefed reporters,  said the offer was a ""gesture of our intentions to comply in full"" with a 1987  Central American peace accord that helped disarm the U.S.-backed rebellion by  Contras against Sandinista rule.      Details Still Unclear    Espinoza said that Ortega first raised the possibility of early elections in  private meetings with opposition political parties in Managua last week and  that details are still to be negotiated.    ""The only thing that could upset this plan is if the opposition parties do not  go along,"" Espinoza said.    The voting will be for president, vice president, a 96-member National Assembly  and, for the first time in Nicaragua, municipal councils.    The Nicaraguan Democratic Coordinate, the principal Nicaraguan opposition  group, criticized the offer as insufficient but did not reject it outright.  More important, they said, is that the government first meet their demands for  reforms that would ease Sandinista control of the army, the press and the  electoral process.    ""If elections are held only to legitimize the party in power, then it does not  matter when they take place,"" said Carlos Huembes, president of the dissident  coalition.    The Sandinistas came to power in a guerrilla insurrection in 1979 and first  held elections in November, 1984. Ortega won a six-year presidential term,  defeating six other candidates. The Democratic Coordinate boycotted the vote,  saying that the rules favored the Sandinistas.    Under the peace accord signed 18 months ago, Central American leaders agreed to  try to halt guerrilla wars through democratic reforms that would guarantee free  elections. The two-day summit that opened Monday is considered a last-ditch  attempt to save the pact from failure.    Costa Rican President Oscar Arias Sanchez, author of the agreement, is trying  to use the summit to oblige the Sandinista government to ease its political  control of Nicaragua and the Salvadoran authorities to reconsider a guerrilla  proposal that presidential elections be postponed so that the rebels can take  part.    But Arias received a setback when El Salvador refused to discuss the guerrilla  proposal here. ""The battle is going to be hard,"" one Costa Rican official  commented during a break in the meeting.    Salvadoran President Jose Napoleon Duarte, thinned by his fight against liver  cancer, opened the summit in a palm-shaded beachfront hotel in this Pacific  coastal village. It was his fourth meeting since May, 1986, with Arias, Ortega  and Presidents Vinicio Cerezo Arevalo of Guatemala and Jose Azcona Hoyo of  Honduras.    With Duarte's term due to expire in June, and Azcona and Arias to leave office  within a year after that, this is expected to be the final gathering of the  agreement's five signers.    ""Whoever succeeds us will be less committed to the peace plan than we are,""  Arias said before traveling to El Zapote. ""That is why we must make a great  effort to reach important agreements that will restore the Central American  people's faith that we can soon achieve peace.""      Truce Talks in 3 Conflicts    The 1987 accord led to cease-fire negotiations in the region's three guerrilla  conflicts. Those talks broke down quickly in El Salvador and Guatemala. But in  the case of Nicaragua, the talks prompted the U.S. Congress to cut off military  aid to the Contras a year ago and led to a truce last March.    Further talks aimed at a final Nicaraguan peace treaty collapsed last June,  however, when the Contras accused the Sandinistas of evading their obligations  under the regional pact to allow amnesty for political prisoners, press freedom  and ""total political pluralism.""    Most Contras have since withdrawn to border camps in Honduras, keeping that  U.S. ally in violation of a clause in the accord that bars any government from  harboring guerrillas trying to oust another government.    Differences over how to untangle the peace process have delayed the summit  three times since August. Apparently to minimize public friction, the  presidents canceled a series of pre-summit press conferences. At at a brief  photo session, only Duarte spoke, expressing vague ""optimism"" about ""favorable  conditions for peace.""      Rebels Pledge Restraint    Leftist Salvadoran guerrillas promised to observe a truce during the summit,  but the U.S.-backed army did not follow suit and posted a large contingent of  soldiers around the meeting site 40 miles southeast of the capital.    Arias is seeking to focus the summit on two issues, one involving El Salvador  and the other involving Nicaragua.    In El Salvador, the issue is a rebel proposal to delay scheduled March 19  elections by six months so that electoral guarantees can be worked out for the  rebels and their supporters. The rebels have yet to take part in any voting  during their nine-year-old war.    Arias met with two Salvadoran rebel leaders before coming to El Zapote and held  talks Sunday night with Duarte. A Costa Rican official said that Arias urged  Duarte to consider the rebel proposal ""as a basis for new peace negotiations""  but that Duarte maintained his opposition. Salvadoran Foreign Minister Ricardo  Acevedo Peralta told reporters that the issue is ""an internal matter"" with no  place on the summit agenda.    Indeed, the Associated Press reported that El Salvador's defense minister, Gen.  Carlos Vides Casanova, warned of a coup if Duarte agrees to postpone the  election.    ""If the president retains power beyond the end of his term, the armed forces  would be obliged to depose him -- either the armed forces or the legislative  assembly,"" Vides was quoted as saying.      Push for Concessions    The other issue involves efforts by Arias, Duarte and Azcona to push Nicaragua  into what they call ""democratic concessions"" that would satisfy the Bush  Administration, bring the seven-year-old Contra war to a formal end and ease  regional tensions.    As in previous summits, Ortega came ready to negotiate. Besides announcing  early elections, he offered to free about 3,150 political prisoners if Honduras  accepts his proposal that it disarm the Contras and dismantle their border  camps.    Arias recently said he expects more of the Sandinistas. He has called for  abolishing their press censorship powers, giving anti-Sandinista groups a  television station and rewriting the 1988 election law to dilute the ruling  party's advantages. Contra leaders have urged Arias to go even further and  demand an elected assembly to rewrite Nicaragua's constitution.    More important to Ortega, who is seeking to normalize relations with the United  States, is how each country's steps toward democracy under the peace accord  will be judged for outsiders.    On Monday, he asked the other presidents to allow the Inter-American Human  Rights Commission, an arm of the Organization of American States, to report  every three months on each country's record. He also asked that the OAS and the  United Nations send observers to monitor elections in each country.

In light of this, the U.S.  secretary of state has stressed that the negotiations have  entered a new and important stage. They also agreed to resume  the talks when Christopher returns to Damascus. This means that  the United States is exerting extensive efforts and is also  eager to take steps that will help the parties involved march  together on the long road to peace.    There is no doubt that Syria welcomes the U.S. efforts and  hopes the U.S. secretary of state's tour will produce true and  constructive progress to push the peace process forward. Syria  also reaffirms the constant principles of a just and  comprehensive solution and the basic requirements and necessary  priorities of the peace process. Syria is also eager to achieve  the full goals of the peace process, and will spare no effort to  render the U.S. secretary of state's tour successful in order to  rescue the peace process from the current stalemate it is facing  as a result of the many Israeli obstacles, which have become  traps and mines threatening the peace process and pushing its  toward a deadlock.    Any fair observer will not have much difficulty in  understanding the nature of the Syrian position. Syria's  position toward the peace process is very clear, and not much  effort is needed to explain Syria's role and constant  principles. The entire world is aware of Syria's credibility  and its sound policy toward the peace process. It also  understands Syria's correct position and its principles, derived  from the resolutions of international legitimacy and from the  need to establish justice and protect the region from shocks,  trouble, and tension in order to secure a total Israeli  withdrawal, stability, security, tranquility, and peace in the  region.    Syria opened the way for a real, just, and comprehensive  peace by agreeing to the U.S. initiative based on the principle  of land for peace and the resolutions of international  legitimacy, which stipulate the withdrawal of the Israeli forces  from the occupied Arab territories. During the sixth round of  the Washington talks, Syria presented a paper of principles that  was branded as comprehensive and balanced.    Syria has formulated its clear and serious position toward  peace by adopting the principle of total withdrawal in return  for comprehensive peace. This is a practical and real  translation of the principle of returning the land to its Arab  owners. In other words, there will be no peace with occupation,  and there will be no peace other than just and comprehensive  peace based on regaining rights. This is the honorable peace to  which Syria adheres and seeks.    The necessary condition for the success of U.S. Secretary of  State Warren Christopher's tour lies in Israel's immediate  response to carry out a total withdrawal from the Golan and  return it together with its citizens and every inch of land to  the motherland, Syria. Proceeding from this, it is Israel that  is required to show goodwill to achieve a just and comprehensive  peace.     "
0,FT944-3760 ,"FT944-3760 _AN-ELMDEABYFT 941212   FT  12 DEC 94 / Ulster 'fair jobs' pressure: US investors to demand progress on equal opportunities      By JIMMY BURNS   US investors attending this week's international business conference in Belfast plan to tie future investment to fair employment in Northern Ireland and cross-community involvement in development projects. Renewed focus on both issues emerged at a conference held in the US at the weekend marking the 10th anniversary of the campaign in support of the so-called MacBride principles, which aim to promote civil rights and equal opportunity in Northern Ireland. The US conference was sponsored by Mr Alan Hevesi, the New York City comptroller (treasurer). He has signalled a plan to channel up to Dollars 100m (Pounds 60m) in institutional funds to Ulster in the form of 'Irish Peace bonds' and has already made clear his intention of encouraging companies to adopt employment practices based on the MacBride principles. The US conference was attended by Mr William Flyn, chairman of Mutual America, one of the biggest American insurance companies, who has helped co-ordinate private investor interest on both sides of the Irish border. At the conference both men made clear that US investor confidence in Northern Ireland remained dependent on progress in the peace talks and that any major inflow of capital would have to be tied to a political programme firmly linked to the promotion of equal rights. Mr Hevesi said yesterday that he was planning a 'significant expansion' of the MacBride principles campaign by aiming to influence corporate compliance with 'positive discrimination' towards Roman Catholics in British companies in which there was a significant US shareholding. Until now the campaign, supported by 18 US state legislatures, has played an important role in influencing the employment practices of US companies with operations in Northern Ireland. Mr Hevesi said yesterday: 'The environment for investment in Northern Ireland has improved dramatically as a result of the peace process, but progress towards the elimination of discrimination is painfully slow.' At the weekend conference Mr Flyn renewed his backing for the MacBride principles, and insisted that discrimination had no place in Northern Ireland. He was strongly critical of the opposition of the Reverend Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionist party, to the involvement of the US in the peace process. Mr Hevesi and Mr Flyn will be heading a strong Irish-American caucus at the Belfast conference which is determined to put fair employment and the continuing involvement of Sinn Fein in the peace process at the centre of talks with government officials. The UK government's position is that Northern Ireland's laws provide legally enforceable remedies against discriminatory practices. Yesterday Mr Hevesi released the results of a survey on employment practices of UK companies in Northern Ireland in which New York City has shareholdings, showing continuing religious imbalance at the workplace.

0,FT941-3833 ,"FT941-3833 _AN-ECODSAAOFT 940315   FT  15 MAR 94 / Serbs put new price on Bosnia peace      By LAURA SILBER and JUDY DEMPSEY      BELGRADE, LONDON   Mr Nikola Koljevic, vice-president of the self-styled Serbian republic in Bosnia, said yesterday that the region's Serbs would back a Washington peace plan - which already envisages creating a Bosnian-Croat and Moslem federation - if any Bosnian Serb territory could link up with Serbia proper. The preconditions, put forward in Belgrade yesterday, are aimed at expanding the proposed federation of Bosnia to a broader confederation encompassing Serbia and Montenegro. In effect, it would re-invent part of ex-Yugoslavia. Mr Koljevic was speaking after holding talks with Mr Vitaly Churkin, Russia's special envoy to the region. But western diplomats in Belgrade said any preconditions could undermine the Washington plan - which is due to be signed in the US on Friday - because Croats and Moslems would not accept any re-invention of the old Yugoslavia. Croatia's fight for independence was about breaking away from Serb-dominated Yugoslavia. More importantly, UN and US diplomats in Vienna, who are hosting the Bosnian Croat/Moslem talks, said the viability of any Croat/Moslem federation would require Bosnian Serbs ceding control of land they hold in the republic to about 49 per cent. They already control about 70 per cent of the territory and show no signs of giving up any land. Mr Koljevic said it was 'difficult to believe that this (confederation) is a serious possibility because the other two sides have rejected any confederation with Yugoslavia'. Mr Churkin and Mr Charles Redman, the US special envoy to the former Yugoslavia, require consent from President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia, and the Bosnian Serbs, for the federal plan for Bosnia. Without the full, and unconditional, consent of the Serbs the federation is meaningless because it will have no agreed boundaries between the federation and Serb-held territories in Bosnia. Mr Koljevic said the Bosnian Serbs were willing first to negotiate a peace agreement, but they would only attend talks 'under equal conditions', implying that sanctions on Serbia would have to be first lifted. A UN official said yesterday the US might be prepared to lift the sanctions if Mr Milosevic agreed to extend diplomatic recognition to Croatia. This would mean recognising the republic's borders, as well as disowning the Krajina Serbs, who have declared their autonomy in south-western Croatia.

""The Near East is really near for us, Russians,"" he said.  ""This explains, in particular, the recent intensity of Russian  diplomatic contacts in the region. During his visit to  Damascus, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov handed to  President Hafiz Al-Asad a message from Boris Yeltsin. We  regard Syria's role in the Middle East peace process as a key  factor, without which any contacts between the parties to the  dragged out conflict would be one-sided, to say the least.  Al-Asad's personal authority as a political leader is very  high. Moscow's ties with Damascus are traditional and our  attraction to each other remains very strong even though our  relations had made little headway in the recent period.""    Posuvalyuk stressed that the new Russo-Syrian relations were  not beginning from scratch and that they had a rich background.  He laid stress on the continuing dialogue and the development  of economic relations that are based on new principles.  ""Al-Asad,"" the presidential envoy said, ""agreed with us that the  present level of relations did not meet the expectations of the  two countries and that they should be further developed in all  directions.""    The diplomat said that the Syrian president welcomed  Russia's  active role in the effort to settle the Middle East problem.  The views of the two countries on the approaches to this  problem are similar. They believe that they should be based on  the principle: Territories in exchange for peace"".    Posuvalyuk met King Husayn of Jordan and Crown Prince Hassan  in Amman. ""It is gratifying,"" he said, ""That the Jordanian  leadership also assesses correctly the Russian policy in the  Middle East. Jordan has made more progress in talks with Israel  than the other Arab states. But the peace process calls for  synchronous progress and King Husayn is well aware of it. He is  fully dedicated to the achievement of an all-embracing  settlement.    The presidential envoy met Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and  Foreign Minister Shimon Peres during his visit to Israel. They  assured the Russian representative that they were ready to exert  every effort to resume the talks on Palestinian autonomy on the  basis of the ""Gaza-Jericho-today"" plan. ""During our talks,""  Posuvalyuk said, ""we arrived at the conclusion that Russia's  vigorous efforts in the Middle East are conducive for the peace  process, and the Israeli side welcomed them. We also discussed  preparations for Rabin's visit to Moscow.""    Posuvalyuk especially stressed the importance of this visit  and also of Yasir 'Arafat's trip to Moscow on April 19. ""The  Moscow meetings of the two leaders, who are displaying political  wisdom and perspicacity, should be regarded as new links in the  chain of events contributing to the peace process,"" he said.

In his first full-length speech since the IRA mortar attacks on Heathrow Airport, Sir Patrick will directly attack Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, saying that he has delivered only death and threats of death. The Northern Ireland secretary will tell Conservative activists in south-east England that the attacks at Heathrow Airport have enabled people to make up their minds about the republican leader's true intentions. Mr Clinton made it clear at a dinner in Washington on Thursday night that he would not authorise a repeat visa for Mr Adams to visit America until the IRA ended violence. In another policy turnaround, he has dropped earlier controversial plans to send a 'peace envoy' to Northern Ireland. The president called on 'all those who practice violence for political aims to lay down their arms'. He urged Sinn Fein and the IRA to endorse the joint declaration as 'the only way forward'. His remarks were backed up yesterday by Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, who was in Washington to join Mr Clinton for St Patrick's Day celebrations. He said the message of US support would have an important influence on the outcome of the initiative. Mr Reynolds said political leaders would have to 'show daring as never before, fortitude as never before, in bringing about the goal of peace'. Mr Adams, who on Thursday said the US administration could play an important role in the search for peace, yesterday attacked the British government for blocking progress. He said Downing Street's inflexible and unimaginative attitude was the major obstacle to ending the current impasse. The fight goes on, Page 9   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Two days of talks on a ceasefire and a territorial division  of Bosnia wound up in Talloires Thursday. The source close to  the talks said they had made some progress.

But a Croat press source earlier the Moslems and Bosnian  Croats were ready to negotiate on the basis of the European  Union territorial division plan, earmarking 51 percent of the  republic for the new Moslem-Croat federation and 49 percent for  the Bosnian Serb side.

0,FT931-161 ,"FT931-161 _AN-DC4CXAD7FT 930331   FT  31 MAR 93 / Leading Article: Peace hopes in Bosnia, again   THERE HAVE been so many false dawns since the Bosnian conflict started a year ago that the latest favourable indicators must be viewed with caution. A cease-fire that has held for three days and the Bosnian president's signature on an agreement which has yet to be endorsed by those mainly responsible for the war in the first place, the Bosnian Serbs, do not add up to a peace settlement. But there are signs that the prospects for a negotiated peace agreement are no longer as hopeless as they were. The main reason for a more optimistic view is the growing evidence that international pressures are finally beginning to have an impact. The mediators, Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, have always acted on the assumption that Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian president, is the puppet master who must be persuaded to exert pressure on his Bosnian kinsmen if any progress towards a peace settlement is to be made. Last January, it was Mr Milosevic who twisted the arm of the Bosnian Serb leader, Mr Radovan Karadzic, to accept the first part of the Vance-Owen peace plan, the constitutional framework for Bosnia. Last week, it was again Mr Milosevic who masterminded the ceasefire talks in Belgrade between the warring factions and the UN commanders. The Serbian president did not seem to apply the same pressure to Mr Karadzic in the intervening period. But the tide turned when both the US, initially highly sceptical of the Vance-Owen plan for a decentralised Bosnia-Hercegovina of 10 semi-autonomous provinces, and Russia, appointed their own envoys to the peace talks and gave their full backing to the plan. That has had two main results. The US has been able to persuade an increasingly recalcitrant Mr Alija Izetbegovic, the Moslem Bosnian president, to sign the provincial map, in New York last week. Probably, the quid pro quo was an American undertaking to back the implementation of any peace agreement with ground troops. The mediators' strategy of isolating Mr Karadzic, so that the maximum international pressure could henceforth be focused on him, has thus been realised. The Russians, meanwhile, have been using their influence equally discreetly with their traditional allies, the Serbs, so that they, in turn, would exert pressure on the Bosnian Serbs. The meeting in Belgrade yesterday between Mr Milosevic and Mr Vitaly Churkin, the Russian envoy to the peace talks, was part of that process. It is possible, though by no means certain, that all this pressure will lead to the approval by the self-styled Bosnian Serb parliament within the next two weeks of the Vance-Owen plan. That does not, of course, guarantee that it would be faithfully implemented or remain viable in the longer run. To have any chance of success, as the UN and Nato have realised, it would require the presence of 50,000 to 70,000 troops for many years to police its provisions. It is still far from certain that the international community is prepared to make such an effort, though the opposition of governments to participation in UN peace enforcement operations is less strong than it was. The decisive argument in favour of the Vance-Owen plan is that, with all its weaknesses, it remains the only game in town. Its strength, and advantage over all other schemes, is that it has the backing of all the big powers. A genuine attempt should therefore be made to make it work. The only alternative is to accept a military fait accompli.   Countries:-  BAZ  Bosnia-Hercegovina, East Europe.   Industries:-  P9721 International Affairs.   Types:-  CMMT  Comment  Analysis.

The visa will allow him to launch a media blitz on behalf of  the republican cause but not to raise funds.    Officials said Mr Adams will be allowed to stay only 48  hours, be barred from travelling more than 25 miles from New  York and not allowed to engage in ""direct or indirect fund  raising.""    The ostensible purpose of his trip is to attend a conference  of the National Committee on American Foreign Policy, a  non-profit group whose honorary chairman is the former secretary  of state Henry Kissinger.    Some members of Congress opposed the visa as a dangerous  concession that could only result in political comfort for the  IRA. The U.S. decision followed a statement in which Mr Adams  declared himself to be against all forms of violence in Northern  Ireland, ""including the violence of the British army and  security forces,"" and said he looked forward to the disbandment  of the IRA.    Mr Adams has been repeatedly denied admission to the United  States over the past 20 years on grounds of his alleged  involvement in terrorism.    Ulster Unionists and Conservative backbenchers will be  concerned that American-Irish politicians will give him a  publicity platform and effectively condone terrorism.    The British Government said that Sinn Fein would be judged  by  deeds, not words. A spokesman said: ""The fact is that Adams  said in a statement that he wants to end violence and is working  towards supporting the Downing Street declaration, and it is on  that basis that he is being admitted, under very strict  conditions for 48 hours. The British Government does not issue  visas for admission to the U.S.""    Labour's Northern Ireland spokesman, Kevin McNamara, said:  ""We are against exclusion orders in principle. It is purely an  internal domestic matter for the United States Government, and I  have no views about it.""    Ken Maginnis, Ulster Unionist MP for Fermanagh and South  Tyrone, who refused to go to the same conference if Mr Adams was  there, said last night: ""My understanding was that two  conditions were being imposed on Mr Adams, firstly that he  accepted the Downing Street declaration and secondly that the  IRA would cease violence. I cannot believe that he has accepted  either of those.""    Sammy Wilson, spokesman for the hardline Democratic Unionist  Party, last night deplored the U.S. decision. ""It's quite clear  since the declaration was signed on December 15 that the payoff  for the IRA was coming. They've had their secret talks with the  British Government, the broadcasting ban in the Irish Republic  has been lifted and even the Americans are in the payoff too by  giving their terrorist leader a plafform.""    The conference will give Mr Adams the opportunity to  reinvigorate the U.S. support for Sinn Fein, and to appear on as  many U.S. TV news and talkshows as he can squeeze in.    The Clinton administration had said last week that its  decision would depend on a statement of Mr Adams's views on  violence and his readiness to support the peace efforts of John  Major and the Irish Government.    British officials in Washington last night were putting the  best face on their defeat, suggesting that if Mr Adams lived up  to his statement, Northern Ireland would benefit. If he did  not, the U.S. Government would learn its lesson, and Sinn Fein  would lose credibility.    President Clinton was under strong pressure from congressmen  with influential Irish-American constituencies. Democratic  senators Teddy Kennedy of Massachusetts, who faces a difficult  re-election battle this year, and Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New  York, whose chairmanship of the finance commitee gives him a  near-stranglehold on Mr Clinton's domestic agenda, had both  urged that the visa be granted.    Before the announcement from Washington, Mr Adams had denied  he had renounced violence as a condition of getting the visa. He  said in Dublin that he had had ""a very interesting exchange of  views"" with a senior U.S. official which showed that the Clinton  administration was acquainting itself with the republican  position.    The Irish Government remained aloof from the controversy  sticking to its formal line that it was entirely a matter for  Washington. It is believed to have cautioned the Americans  against allowing Mr Adams too much latitude.     "

In a move almost a mirror image of that carried out some years ago by Abbey National, Irish Permanent shares were given to borrowers and lenders and priced at 180p in the Republic of Ireland, the equivalent of 180p sterling. The flotation was organised jointly by Riada, the Irish stockbroker, and Hoare Govett. After opening at 208p the shares raced ahead to touch a high of 217p before closing at 215p. Turnover reached 6.1m shares with dealers reporting aggressive demand for the shares from Ireland and the UK. Excellent third-quarter figures from Shell Oil, the Royal Dutch/Shell subsidiary, triggered a bout of strong support for Shell Transport stock from both sides of the Atlantic. At the close Shell were 11 1/2 higher at 711 1/2 p after turnover of 3.9m shares. Analysts moved to upgrade forecasts for Shell Transport after the Shell Oil numbers, its best third-quarter results since 1985. 'We're upgrading our recommendation on Shell from hold to buy,' said Mr John Toalster at Strauss Turnbull. 'There is a feeling of confidence about Shell; they're tackling the problem areas, such as chemicals, and the recovery in the group is gathering momentum,' the Strauss analyst said. BP was rather left behind by Shell, the shares edging up only 2 to 415 1/2 p on 7.2m traded. Airports group BAA rose 11 to 503p following a reassuring note from NatWest Securities which attempts to put the Heathrow subsidence problems into perspective. Heathrow accounted for 59 per cent of passengers handled by BAA last year and 68 per cent of operating profits. NatWest says the disruption is squeezing spending levels but sees higher spending at other BAA airports as a cushion as traffic switches. Second quarter results are due November 7. Media conglomerate Pearson was a strong performer on the back of broker presentations regarding the impending flotation of satellite broadcaster BSkyB, in which Pearson has a significant stake. The shares jumped 18 to 613p. Reuters Holdings slipped 3 to 447p ahead of third-quarter revenue figures due today. International advertising group WPP jumped 4 to 109p on heavier turnover than normal of 7.8m shares with SG Warburg recommending the stock. Medeva jumped 15 and closed 9 better at 174p after announcing it had won the right to continue development of its hepatitis B vaccine following a judgment by the Court of Appeal that Biogen's patent is invalid in the UK. Drinks group Allied Domecq advanced 13 to 587p following the announcement of talks aimed at selling its Dutch brewing operations helped refocus attention on the potentially much bigger disposal of Allied's food manufacturing business. Best known for its Tetley tea-bags, the food division accounted for more than a tenth of group trading profits last year. A number of potential buyers are being pencilled in by the stock market, notably the Dalgety and Irish group Kerry which is said to be keen to acquire DCA, Allied's US supplier of bakery mixes and equipment. Elsewhere in the drinks sector, Bass continued to gain ground, adding 6 to 547p for a three day gain of almost 4 per cent. In contrast, Greenalls shed 4 to 405p.

An official who refused to be identified said that the PLO  is  expected to set up an interim committee soon to receive  financial aid from the world for the rehabilitation of the Gaza  Strip and the West Bank city of Jericho.    Seoul expressed its will to support rehabilitation of the  autonomous region at multilateral talks in Washington Oct. 2-3  last year. Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu attended the talks  co-chaired by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and  Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev.    The talks were the first international ones held to handle  the aid program since Israel and the PLO signed a peace accord  in Washington early last September.    ""We are unable to discuss the aid program as no recipient  body has yet been set up by the PLO,"" the official said.    But inter-ministerial consultations are under way on the  methods of financial aid to the PLO following the establishment  of a recipient body, he said.    He said he is quite sure that the aid program will be  discussed bilaterally with the PLO, not international bodies or  Israel.    Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres telephoned his Korean  counterpart Han to support the rehabilitation of the autonomous  region of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and Jericho, shortly  after the signing of the peace accord.    It is expected that the government will extend soft loans  from the Economic Development and Cooperation Fund (EDCF). The  EDCF is a government-managed fund for developing nations.    But other officials did not rule out that nonrefundable aid  would also be delivered although in small amounts.    The United States has projected collecting contributions  through the International Monetary Fund (IMF) or the World Bank.    At present, no country has extended aid to PLO for the same  reason as Korea and also because of the uncertainty of the  Middle East peace.    PLO chief Yasir 'Arafat also expressed hope for assistance  from South Korea in a recent interview with KBS [Korea  Broadcasting System]. 'Arafat is familiar with North Korean  leaders, having visited Pyongyang several times.    South Korea has no formal diplomatic ties with the PLO but  has already recognized its identity.     "

The head of the  delegation will deliver a message to President Hafiz al-Asad  from Russian President Boris Yeltsin concerning developments in  the Middle East, the peace process, the Russian efforts made in  this connection, and bilateral relations. According to Russian  sources, the Russian delegation is expected to discuss the debts  question and Syria's needs, that is, spare parts and weapons.    The delegation will also visit a number of industrial  installations and participate in opening the electrical ""Tishrin  Complex"" in which Russia participates.    Syrian-Russian committees will meet to solve the problem of  the military debts Syria owes to the Russian Federation, as the  heir of the former Soviet Union. The debt problems will be  solved in the two countries' joint interests. The debts are  estimated at about $1.5 billion.    Syria had demanded that Russia fulfill its defense needs  requested from the former Soviet Union under the friendship and  cooperation agreement signed between the two countries in 1980.

Vivekanand, JORDAN TIMES staff reporter]    [Excerpts] Amman--American and Jordanian officials are  scheduled to meet in Washington Thursday [31 March] to discuss  Jordan's demand for a solution to the negative impact on its  economy of the de facto blockade of al-'Aqabah imposed by the  enforcers of the 44-month-old international sanctions against  Iraq, Information Minister Jawad al-'Anani said Tuesday.    Addressing a press conference after a regular Council of  Ministers meeting, Dr. al-'Anani called on the U.S. to seek a  speedy solution to the problem so that Jordan could go back to  the 28-month-old American-backed Arab-Israeli peace negotiations.    The government has been informed by the Jordanian embassy in  Washington that a meeting has been scheduled for Thursday among  Jordanian officials and representatives of all concerned U.S.  government departments and agencies to discuss the issue, Dr.  al-'Anani said.    ""The Jordanian government urges concerned authorities in the  U.S. and also the United Nations to speed up the proposal to  replace offshore inspections by onshore inspections by a third  neutral party,"" said Dr. al-'Anani. [passage omitted]    Dr. al-'Anani said Jordan did not share the view that the  Arab-Israeli peace process and the effects of the international  sanctions imposed against Iraq following its invasion of Kuwait  in August 1990 were two separate issues.    ""We believe that the issue of al-'Aqabah cannot be fully  disassociated from the peace process,"" he said. ""After all, the  whole peace process was basically generated after the Gulf war.  Therefore, to say that there is no link is not a view that is  necessarily shared by Jordan.""    Dr. al-'Anani said a recent escalation of the interceptions  and inspection procedures adopted by the American-led warships  patrolling the Red Sea could not but be seen as a form of  indirect pressure on Jordan to accept an Israeli demand that the  Kingdom sign a peace agreement and then negotiate the terms of  the accord.    ""Jordan is not going to succumb to pressures of this kind,""  the minister said. ""We want the peace process to pursure a  rational path. Jordan does not need to give any further  evidence to its positive attitude and its important and key role  in the peace process itself."" [passage omitted]    Dr. al-'Anani, who estimated that Jordan lost up to $1.3  billion in extra freight costs alone as a result of higher  charges levied by shipowners sending their vessels to and from  al-'Aqabah since the sanctions against Iraq were imposed in  August 1990, noted that inspectors have not been able to find a  single violation of the sanctions after checking more than 1,700  vessels.    Despite such a record, he said, Jordan continued to suffer  from the modalities of the inspections. The minister said the  Kingdom reserved the right to demand compensation for the losses  it incurred.    ""The final effect of the method of inspections on  Jordan-bound ships is not justified by the method of application  of sanctions against Iraq,"" Dr. al-'Anani said. ""Alternatives  were offered and we think they should have been studied but that  should not have taken so much to be finalised and approved.    ""Therefore, when the number of ships that were intercepted  escalated in the last month while there was a constructive  proposal that has been discussed but not ratified, we had to  draw a conclusion that Jordan is targeted economically and  politically...,"" said Dr. al-'Anani. [passage omitted]    The information Minister welcomed a statement by U.S. State  Department spokesman Michael McCurry that the Jordanian proposal  was under study and said Jordan hoped that ""this matter will be  very very soon resolved.""    ""If that happens, then we think it would iron out a major  problem which is not only affecting the Jordanian economy but  also inflaming popular response to the whole situation,"" Dr.  al-'Anani said.    The minister was referring to a call issued by Parliament  last week for the goverment to refuse to return to peace talks  with Israel until the siege of al-'Aqabah is lifted and the  lifting is formally announced at the Security Council.    Dr. al-'Anani said the Jordanian call for an end to the  ""modus operandi"" of inspecting Aqaba-bound vessels was not  linked to the overall sanctions against Iraq although Jordan  strongly felt that the situation of the Iraqi people was  worsening due to lack of enough food and medicine.    Dr. al-'Anani also reiterated that Jordan would not accept  the stationing of international forces in its territory since  such a move... will be in violation of Jordan's sovereignty and  territorial integrity."" [punctuation as published]    Asked whether Jordan would attend an April 7 round of  multilateral talks on the environment, which is part of the  Middle East process, Dr. al-'Anani said: ""We hope that the  concerned parties will arrive at a speedy decision to solve the  problem"" of the siege of Aqaba.

His  majesty also stressed the call to achieve this objective quickly.    The Jordanian-U.S. summit was a great opportunity to  exchange  views on developments of the Middle East peace process and the  results of the contacts and meetings held to promote this  process, including the recent Syrian-U.S. meeting in Geneva, in  order to plan for the next move in the upcoming bilateral talks  aimed at achieving a peace that would secure the Arab rights and  entrench the bases of security, stability, and cooperation in  this turbulent region.    Now that efforts are focusing on achieving the real  objectives of the peace process, laxity in the negotiations and  removing them from their true course would create more obstacles  and complications that might waste this precious opportunity and  push the entire region back into a whirlpool of endless  conflict. The repercussions and threats of such a conflict  would undermine regional and world security.    Thus, King Husayn was eager to stress the importance of  gaining time and speeding up the peace steps and translating  them into realities on the ground, based on international  legitimacy and its resolutions in a way that will secure a  comprehensive and just peace that would return the occupied  territories and the usurped rights to their owners in addition  to establishing an equitable, balanced, and fair political and  economic order throughout the Middle East.    With regard to the Jordanian-Palestinian coordination, his  majesty's emphasis on this positive coordination as part of a  comprehensive peace embodied the continued Jordanian support for  the Palestinian people and their legitimate representative, the  PLO, to regain their territories, rights, and sovereignty.    The real desire for peace according to the principles and  terms of reference of the Madrid conference, which His Majesty  King Husayn and His Excellency President Hafiz al-Asad stressed  in their meetings with President Clinton, as well as the Arab  parties' response to the bases of such a peace, with all its  political, economic, and legitimate dimensions, would both place  the United States before its moral and political  responsibilities to promote the peace process and remove it from  the procrastinations and deviation which Israel employs in each  phase of negotiations and on all tracks. Such procrastination,  however, has not yet succeeded in foiling the peace process or  pushing it to a deadlock. Israel wants such a deadlock, but the  United States has thus far ignored this.     "

The prime minister said Israel is prepared to offer ""full autonomy"" to the  Arabs in the occupied West Bank and Gaza during an interim period leading to  final talks. His outline was based squarely on the 1978 Camp David Accords  between Israel and Egypt, which Shamir has steadfastly used as a guide.      Troops Would Pull Back    Shamir added that during the period of autonomy, designed to last for five  years, the Israeli army would pull out of big cities in the West Bank and Gaza,  as stipulated in the Camp David Accords. ""There will be some concentration of  our troops in specified locations not including big centers of population,"" he  said.    ""I am deeply convinced that the moment we can get to this stage and  negotiations will start, positive results will come,"" Shamir concluded.    Reporters who asked Shamir's spokesman, Avi Pazner, to characterize the  significance of the prime minister's remarks were told:    ""The prime minister was reiterating his readiness to implement Camp David and  grant the Palestinians full autonomy.""    Pressed as to whether Shamir has ever before so explicitly stated the terms of  what he is prepared to accept, Pazner answered: ""He always spoke like this.  People just don't listen.""    Arab reaction was negative. Faisal Husseini, considered the top pro-PLO leader  in the occupied lands, said: ""Compared to his old stand, he has moved a step,  but it is a far step from meeting the demands or conditions of the Palestinian  people. We can't accept it.""    The Palestine Liberation Organization, according to a report from Tunis, where  the group's leaders reside in exile, considers Shamir's plan warmed-over Camp  David and a ploy to control the West Bank and Gaza forever.    ""I advise Mr. Shamir to stop digging into his old stock and bringing out these  goods which are out of date. . . . No Palestinians or Arabs will speak to him  on this basis,"" PLO spokesman Ahmed Abdul-Rahman told the Reuters news agency.    A skeptical official at the Israeli Foreign Ministry, who asked not to be  identified by name, commented, ""Shamir is toying with trial balloons, trying to  make old positions seem new.""    Shamir, in giving a skeletal version of the Camp David schedule, said: ""The  peace process will be composed of two stages. The first stage will be interim  conditions, and this will include full autonomy, etc. The second stage will be  direct negotiations, without any preconditions between Israel, the Palestinian  Arabs and some Arab countries, if they will join the negotiations.""    ""Full autonomy"" means local self-rule for Palestinians while Israel controls  the land and borders. The phrase ""without preconditions"" is shorthand for  Shamir's resistance to a guaranteed surrender of all or part of the West Bank  and Gaza in return for a peace agreement.    ""No one has the right to dictate the final outcome,"" Shamir said.    That statement was an evident rejection of demands by the PLO for an  independent state, as well as to American calls for Israel to give up at least  some part of the land, which might then be attached to neighboring Jordan.    Israel has been under heavy pressure to come up with a peace plan since last  fall, when the PLO began new diplomatic moves aimed at convening international  peace talks on the Middle East. Words of moderation from PLO leaders netted the  group talks with the United States and renewed stature in Western Europe.    The PLO wants to be a party to any talks; Israel refuses to meet with the  organization.    In recent weeks, top Israeli officials have given confused signals as to how  Israel will respond to the fluid diplomatic scene. Defense Minister Yitzhak  Rabin has tried to open avenues of contact with pro-PLO Arabs in the West Bank  and Gaza. Shamir, while not criticizing Rabin, says these moves are just  Rabin's private ""ideas"" and not a peace plan.    Shamir's spokesman, Pazner, was asked whether the peace outline issued  Wednesday is the final framework for the government's peace plan that Shamir  has promised since he began his second term as prime minister last month.    ""Not at all,"" he replied. ""This will come later.""    Washington responded cautiously to Shamir's remarks. A State Department  official spokesman declined to evaluate them.    Israeli critics predicted that a peace plan based on an open-ended view of Camp  David would go nowhere.    ""It's a non-starter,"" said Abrasha Tamir, who was an adviser on security  affairs to the Israeli government when it worked out the Camp David agreement.

The briefing was devoted to the results of the March, 19-21  visit to Russia of Tsutomu Hata, deputy prime minister and  foreign minister of Japan. The head of the Japanese Foreign  Office was received by Russian Prime Minister Viktor  Chernomyrdin and held talks with Russian Foreign Minister Andrey  Kozyrev.    Participants in the talks spoke for maintaining the new  political climate in bilateral relations in accordance with the  provisions of the Tokyo declaration signed in October last year  by Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa.    Both sides expressed the intention to raise the level of the  Russo-Japanese inter-governmental dialogue on trade and economic  issues with the aim of further intensification of mutually  beneficial ties in this sphere.    Moscow and Tokyo agreed to continue contacts on the issues  connected with the advancement to the conclusion of a peace  treaty between the two countries including within the framework  of the working group on a peace treaty at the level of deputy  foreign ministers.    Both sides expressed understanding that the solution to the  territorial problem which is one of the aspects of a peace  treaty, requires gradual and careful actions within the  framework of the existing agreements.    When discussing international issues, Grigoriy Karasin said,  Russian and Japanese foreign ministers stated similarity or  closeness of positions on a majority of actual problems.  Serious attention was given to the situation in the  Asian-Atlantic region where both sides see the possibility to  continue specific interaction in the settlement of the current  problems.    Tsutomu Hata and Andrey Kozyrev confirmed common  understanding of the need to continue active contacts and  promote progressive development of the Russo-Japanese political  dialogue with the aim of strengthening goodneighborly relations,  partnership and trust between the two countries in the interests  of the peoples of Russia and Japan.    Both sides attach priority significance to carrying out an  intensive preparation for a new Russo-Japanese summit meeting  during an official visit of Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa to Moscow the date of which will be agreed upon  additionally through diplomatic channels.

President Bill Clinton said Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, and Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO chairman, had agreed to his request that they should send negotiators to the US as soon as possible 'and to stay here in continuous session until their work is completed'. In the single worst attack on Palestinians since Israel occupied the West Bank in 1967, an Israeli settler opened fire with an automatic rifle in the packed Cave of the Patriarchs in Hebron at the start of the morning's Moslem Ramadan prayers. Dozens of Palestinians were wounded and a further 12 killed by Israeli troops during subsequent protests. As news of the killings spread throughout the occupied territories, first Hebron and then the entire West Bank and Gaza Strip erupted in clashes between Palestinians and Israeli troops. 'Extremists on both sides are determined to drag Arabs and Israelis back into the darkness of unending conflict,' Mr Clinton said yesterday. 'The answer now is to redouble our efforts to conclude the talks between Israel and the PLO and begin implementation of the agreement they have made as rapidly as possible,' he said. No date has been set for the talks. Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, called for calm to prevent the 'enemies of peace' from exploiting yesterday's tragedy. The gunman, an American-immigrant doctor, Dr Baruch Goldstein, who lived in the nearby radical Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba, appeared to have planned the attack in an effort to torpedo the peace negotiations. The Israeli authorities said Dr Goldstein later died, but it was not clear whether he had been overpowered or had committed suicide. Mr Arafat summoned Palestinian leaders to a crisis meeting in Tunis. 'What has happened today in the mosque is a real tragedy and will make a very negative backfire on the whole peace process,' he said. Mr Rabin said in a telephone call to Mr Arafat that he condemned the massacre and promised to investigate eyewitness claims that Dr Goldstein had not acted alone. He also offered to speed up the transition to Palestinian self-rule in the territories. 'As an Israeli, I am ashamed,' he told Mr Arafat, according to an Israel Radio report. Earlier Mr Rabin had said he hoped the 'loathsome criminal act of murder' would not be followed by Arab attempts at revenge. Several Israeli ministers proposed banning the racist Kach movement of which Dr Goldstein was a member, and disarming its supporters. The shooting took place soon after 5am, when the vast mosque that covers the tomb of biblical patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, was crammed with about 500 Moslems marking the month-long Ramadan fast. Dr Goldstein, a 42-year-old Brooklyn-born father of four who had spoken out publicly about his hatred of Arabs, burst into the mosque wearing his army reservist's uniform, and then opened fire with a Galil automatic rifle. Eyewitnesses said Israeli soldiers on duty at the site allowed him to keep firing for more than 10 minutes. An Israeli army spokesman insisted that no soldiers had been inside the mosque, and that fleeing Palestinians had prevented troops from entering to intervene. Dr Wissam Muhtaseb, who was treating the wounded at Hebron's Al-Ahali hospital, said six Palestinians were killed outside the hospital when soldiers tried to disperse crowds congregating outside. There were also reports of two deaths in Gaza and one in Nablus.

The session, the culmination of a two-month review conference, is due to focus on the organisation's future. Russia is keen to strengthen the CSCE, which includes all European and Commonwealth of Independent states as well as the US and Canada. However, divisions among Nato members over Bosnia are likely to overshadow proceedings. European Union finance ministers meet in Brussels ahead of the European Council summit in Essen on Friday and Saturday. Germany, which holds the rotating EU presidency, will push hard for agreement on Ecu85m (Dollars 108m) balance of payments assistance to Ukraine. Jacques Delors, outgoing president of the European Commission, will appeal for support for funding trans- European networks to improve transport and energy infrastructure. Ministers are also likely to review currency stability since last year's crisis in the exchange rate mechanism. Olympian task: Greece's socialist government is due to propose controversial legislation on overhauling Olympic Airways, the loss-making state carrier.

East European economies face a brighter future, according to a report out today from the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe. However, output is still falling in Russia and other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States. John Major's UK government faces another testing vote in parliament, this time on a procedural motion which would allow the opposition Labour party to challenge the imposition of VAT on domestic heating fuel. The government, technically in a minority after the suspension of some members, could lose, but will probably scrape home. UK economic policy: Last week's UK Budget comes under the scrutiny of the cross-party House of Commons treasury and civil service committee. MPs will question Treasury officials on expenditure and taxation, fiscal and monetary policy in preparation for meetings next week with Jonathan Aitken, the chief secretary, and Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor.

Were Swapo to garner a two-thirds majority, it could make alterations to the constitution. UK interest rates: Kenneth Clarke, chancellor, and Eddie George (left), governor of the Bank of England, meet to discuss interest rates in the light of last week's Budget proposals. The arguments for and against a rise in base rates from 5.75 per cent are finely balanced. The Bank fears strong economic growth may trigger inflationary pressures. Analysts believe Mr Clarke will urge delay at least until January to prevent a pre-Christmas upset to the retail trade and to allow the public to digest his Budget measures. Kyrgyzstan and the World Bank co-sponsor a two-day investors' conference in Paris.

In the new foreign minister's first news conference with foreign  correspondents, Arens said that Israel does not approve of the European  Community's plan, announced Monday, to start a Middle East peace initiative by  encouraging an international conference on the region.    ""I think it would be better if prior to undertaking any kind of initiative, the  members of the European Community were to meet with us, were to consult with  us, were to coordinate with us,"" he said.    Arens, 63, a former ambassador to the United States, also renewed Israel's  criticism that the U.S. decision to hold talks with the Palestine Liberation  Organization was damaging the fight against international terrorism.    Arens became foreign minister with the formation of Israel's new government on  Dec. 22. He is a member of the Likud Party of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir,  which has opposed an international Middle East peace conference.    Arens said his government does not welcome isolation but must think first of  security.    ""We should not be expected to take any step that might decrease the sense of  isolation . . . if they are steps that would endanger the state of Israel,""  Arens told the Foreign Press Assn.

In the new foreign minister's first news conference with foreign  correspondents, Arens said that Israel does not approve of the European  Community's plan, announced Monday, to start a Middle East peace initiative by  encouraging an international conference on the region.    ""I think it would be better if prior to undertaking any kind of initiative, the  members of the European Community were to meet with us, were to consult with  us, were to coordinate with us,"" he said.    Arens, 63, a former ambassador to the United States, also renewed Israel's  criticism that the U.S. decision to hold talks with the Palestine Liberation  Organization was damaging the fight against international terrorism.    Arens became foreign minister with the formation of Israel's new government on  Dec. 22. He is a member of the Likud Party of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir,  which has opposed an international Middle East peace conference.    Arens said his government does not welcome isolation but must think first of  security.    ""We should not be expected to take any step that might decrease the sense of  isolation . . . if they are steps that would endanger the state of Israel,""  Arens told the Foreign Press Assn.    Meanwhile, Lova Eliav, a member of the center-left Labor Party, said today that  he and three other Israeli parliament members will attend a European symposium  this month on Middle East peace with PLO representatives despite Israel's ban  on meetings with PLO members.

[passage omitted]    The way Jordan thinks about the nature of the conflict, how  it should be resolved, and the future of the region in light of  comprehensive peace has been appreciated by the U.S.  Administration and public opinion. U.S. Secretary of State  Warren Christopher reiterated U.S. appreciation for His Majesty  King Husayn's leading role in supporting the peace process to  allow it to achieve its objectives.    [Begin recording, in English] [Christopher] I am very  pleased to welcome here to the State Department His Majesty King  Husayn. He's a rather frequent visitor of the United States,  but each time he's very welcome and this time his visit happens  to coincide with the renewal of the bilateral discussions  between Jordan and Israel here in Washington with a streamlined,  though informal, setting. So I think prospects are very good  for making progress there. I am very pleased by a number of  developments in the relations between the U.S. and Jordan since  the last time I met with the king. So in many respects, this is  a very happy occasion, and, as I always do when I see him, I  look forward to it by welcoming you here, your majesty. It is a  great pleasure to have you here.    [Husayn] Thank you very, very much indeed, sir, for the warm  and kind welcome. It is a pleasure to be back in Washington.  I've had the privilege of meeting with the President and  meeting with many of my friends, and now this is really a  wonderful opportunity to be with you, sir. We've seen you in  the area. We appreciate all the efforts that you've made in the  cause of our arrival at a just and comprehensive peace in our  region. And you have our gratitude, admiration, and respect.    [Reporter] [words indistinct] expect to conclude a peace  treaty with Israel? I represent Israel television.    [Husayn] Sir, I hope that we will have started in earnest  now to discuss all items in the agenda and to cover all these  subjects. And I believe our approach is the right one to try to  resolve all the problems that are there and the crowning  achievement will be a peace treaty [words indistinct].    [Reporter] Your Majesty: Can you elaborate on what you mean  by full peace with Israel?    [Husayn] Full peace is full peace. It is a peace that  brings people together, that gives them the opportunities they  never had, that changes the face of our region as a whole, that  is our contribution to future regions.    [Reporter] [words indistinct] Israeli to sign, to move  ahead at all, and not waiting for anybody else. Is Jordan ready  to move ahead without waiting for anybody else?    [Husayn] We are not waiting for anybody, but we hope that,  as things will move, we will all meet before too long, having  accomplished our work in establishing the just and lasting peace  that we have sought for so long.    [Reporter] What can you tell us about the talks that are  taking place in Washington now? Are they making enough progress  for them to ask the full delegations to come next week?    [Christopher] You know, I've just returned from abroad, and  the talks have just started, so I think it's too early to say,  but the new format in which the heads of delegations meet under  streamlined conditions, I think, is very promising, and we'll  see in a week or so whether or not the full delegations should  come here. One thing I would emphasize, and that is, I feel that  real progress can be made in the format that they now have. So  I wouldn't make judging progress dependent on whether and when  the full delegations will come here.    [Reporter] Mr. Secretary: Jordan seems to be very close to  an agreement with Israel and I feel that they could have had it,  if not last year, probably 10 years ago. Do you think that  Jordan should move ahead and set an example to the Syrian, or  does the use of the codeword comprehensive mean that you agree  that Jordan ought to wait for the others and [word indistinct]  both sign together?    [Christopher] You know, the role the United States has in  these conversations and negotiations is the role of a cosponsor.  I think the timing is really up to the parties, and I wouldn't  want to try to impose United States views, with respect to  timing. What we want to see is steady progress on all fronts,  and I think the king has given you his indication that they are  making steady progress on all fronts. So I would not, I think  it will be too arrogant for the United States to try to suggest  to the parties a precise timing under which they'll move ahead.  Steady progress is what we now see.

During the meeting, the foreign minister received a message  to President Hafiz al-Asad from South African President Frederik  de Klerk. The foreign minister also received another message  from Mr. (Korreth), head of the judiciary council in South  Africa [title as heard], in which he invites President Hafiz  al-Asad to take part in the celebration scheduled to be held on  10 May 1994 to inaugurate the new South African president.    The talks dealt with developments in South Africa after the  abrogation of the apartheid system and the racial segregation  laws, and the establishment of a democratic system guaranteeing  equality for all citizens in accordance with the new  constitution. The talks also dealt with the Arab-Israeli  conflict and developments in the peace process. In this regard,  the two sides' viewpoints were in agreement on achieving a just  and comprehensive peaceful solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict  based on the implementation of the relevant UN Security Council  resolutions, and on Israel's withdrawal from the occupied Syrian  Golan, the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, and southern Lebanon.    Auret said a peaceful solution can be achieved through the  continuation of the peace talks, and not through acts of  violence, deportation, and the Israeli authorities' demolishing  of Palestinian houses in the occupied territories. He stressed  that the stands of South Africa will be balanced, and that  henceforth, its old relations with Israel will not be at the  expense of its new relations with the Arabs.    The talks during the meeting also dealt with the future  prospects of the relations between Syria and South Africa after  the abrogation of apartheid, and in light of lifting the Arab  and international embargo on dealing with South Africa.    The foreign minister and Mr. Auret expressed their mutual  concern about establishing good relations between the two  countries in the political, economic, trade, tourist, and other  fields. Within this framework, the two sides agreed to resume  contacts between the two countries until diplomatic relations  between them are established.    Attending the meeting were Raslan 'Allush, assistant to the  foreign minister, Dr. Hani Habib, director of the Economic  Department, and Mustafa al-Hajj 'Ali, director of the Africa  Department at the Foreign Ministry.

0,FT942-15619 ,"FT942-15619 _AN-EDNE4AEQFT 940414   FT  14 APR 94 / Minutiae mask the big picture: Violence and symbolic wrangles threaten to undermine the Middle East peace process      By JULIAN OZANNE   After more than half a century of bloodshed in the Middle East, a new beginning could have been celebrated yesterday. Israel was due to complete its military withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and West Bank town of Jericho to make way for Palestinian self-rule. Instead, Israel missed the deadline and Hamas, the extremist Islamic movement opposed to the Israeli-Palestinian peace accord, bombed a crowded commuter bus deep in Israel. The bombing, which left five Israelis dead, was the second attack in a week - another reminder of the escalating violence by both sides which threatens to explode the fragile peace process. On the Israeli side, attacks by settlers and the heavy-handed use of force by soldiers continues. In the occupied West Bank, Israelis shot dead two Palestinians - including a pregnant teenager - on Tuesday, imposed a rigid curfew on the town of Ramallah and blasted a house with anti-tank missiles, later destroying it with a bulldozer. Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, bitterly criticised Israel yesterday, saying it had thwarted peace talks, with its 'policy of mass killings, detention, imposing curfews and isolating towns . . . supporting and encouraging the fanatic settlers to continue practising the most horrible acts of aggression'. Just seven months since the peace agreement was sealed on the White House lawn with a reluctant handshake between Mr Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, concerns are growing that the understanding is so flawed that it has little chance of ending the conflict. Months of tortuous delays in negotiations and bitter wrangling over details, such as where to position the Palestinian flag at border crossings, has created deep scepticism on both sides. For many observers the problem lies with the agreement itself - the Declaration of Principles. It creates a five-year interim period of Palestinian self-rule in Gaza and the West Bank, and shelves sensitive issues such as the creation of a Palestinian state, control of Jerusalem and the right of Palestinian refugees to return. Later talks are scheduled to address the question of a permanent solution for the Palestinians' political aspirations - one of several grey areas open to interpretation and negotiation. The greyest area is the status of the Israeli settlements in the occupied territories, which are to remain untouched during the interim period. Mr Rabin shied away from the tough decision to begin evacuating the 120,000 settlers. The consequence was that weeks have been spent discussing the complex security arrangements necessary to protect the remaining settlers. But leaving these people, some of whom are religious ideologues, in the thick of the Arab population of 1.9m has proved a recipe for violence, as demonstrated by the February 25 Hebron Mosque massacre of 29 Palestinians by one settler. 'The settlements are a self-destruct mechanism in the peace process,' said Mrs Hanan Ashrawi, a prominent Palestinian who has resigned from the negotiating team. 'They cause friction, are a blatant injustice to Palestinians, fragment Palestinian land and prevent the emergence of a geographically contiguous Palestinian entity. Leaving the settlements untouched is like putting a flame next to a powder keg and saying: 'Coexist.' ' Mrs Ashrawi claims that Israel has imposed rigid security requirements on the PLO, and denied the Palestinians the political sovereignty they expected the peace process to deliver. She wants the declaration renegotiated and says Mr Arafat must now consider suspending the peace talks if he is to maintain his credibility with the increasingly disaffected Palestinian people. Many Israelis also believe the settlement issue must be faced sooner rather than later. Mr Joseph Alpher, director of the Jaffe Centre for Strategic Studies at Tel Aviv University, says the government should find the courage to give both settlers and Palestinians a clear timetable and map for Israeli withdrawal from the territories - otherwise more violence is in prospect. The Israeli government, however, says the agreement can work only if it can guarantee to its mounting domestic opposition that security for Israelis will strengthen with peace. The Labour-led coalition government is firm in its refusal either to open up the settlement question now or begin talks on a permanent solution. 'We are negotiating an interim agreement and that won't change,' said Mr Ephrahim Sneh, a Labour member of parliament. 'Now is not the time to deal with the settlement question and, as more terrorist attacks occur, the more difficult it will be to deal with the settlers in the future.' Mr Arafat, therefore, has a stark choice - to abandon the peace talks and push, even at this late stage, for a renegotiation of the declaration, or to try to convince sceptical supporters to implement what they see as a flawed agreement. Many Palestinians believe that if Mr Arafat presses ahead with the latter course, he risks losing credibility to the point where the PLO may no longer command majority Palestinian support. Walking out of peace talks, however, would be difficult. All the reasons which forced the PLO to sign the declaration - its lack of funds, its marginalisation in the Arab world and the strength of Palestinian opponents in the territories - remain urgent concerns. Even if the Israelis made substantial concessions to strengthen his hand, Mr Arafat faces a formidable challenge. Many Palestinians feel he has sold them short by signing the interim declaration. After 27 years of Israeli occupation, they seek an urgent improvement in living standards and a significant measure of democracy in their political life - both of which Mr Arafat has so far been unable to deliver. 'If Arafat does not bring democracy, there will be a revolution, not only against his dictatorship but against the peace process,' said Mr Soufian Abu Zaiyda, a PLO leader in the occupied Gaza strip. Mr Zaiyda said the Palestinian authority to be established after the Israeli withdrawal has to accomplish four urgent tasks to win credibility: enhance the economic wellbeing of Palestinians, protect their security, convince them their leaders are 'working for the people and not against them', and establish democratic institutions 'far away from corruption, bureaucracy and discrimination between people'. As both Israeli and Palestinian negotiators prepare to sign a Gaza-Jericho agreement to usher in Palestinian self-rule, and prepare for the establishment of Mr Arafat and his entourage in Jericho, the question remains of whether the PLO can shore up its dwindling support. 'We accepted Arafat to be the president of Palestine but he has accepted to be the mayor of Gaza- Jericho,' said Hisham Elakra, a disappointed, 19-year-old refugee in the rubbish-strewn Palestinian Jabalya camp. 'He has betrayed our struggle and we must fight against the peace process.' Mr Arafat yesterday seemed to acknow-ledge his supporters' frustrations when he warned that the settlement issue and conduct of peace talks 'will lead us all to catastrophe which will kill any remaining hope, confidence and credibility our Palestinian people . . . still have in the peace process.' He appears to be banking on returning to Gaza-Jericho in a fanfare of glory, and on using international aid to buy off political opposition and create jobs. But even his supporters doubt these measures alone will secure his political base. 'We have reached a moment of truth,' said Mrs Ashrawi. 'Israel's negotiating strategy will continue to erode Arafat's support to the point where the leadership may no longer be able to hold the people.' Thus Israel confronts a dilemma. It does not wish to cede real power or sovereignty to the Palestinians now, but it cannot afford to leave Mr Arafat exposed to criticism from extremists bent on destroying the peace process. Israel knows it must walk a difficult tightrope and, for better or worse, must stick with Mr Arafat as its best negotiating partner. But many Palestinians say Israel has been too stringent in its security requirements and has left Mr Arafat with little ammunition to fend off his most vocal opponents. The danger remains that if Israel does not heed Palestinian demands for more substantial concessions, it may unwittingly play into the hands of those extremists it most fears.

Agreement was reached on the resumption  of the Gaza-Jericho talks next Tuesday, and progress was made on  most of the issues on the agenda. The Cairo talks ended last  night and the Israeli delegation is now on its way home. It  will report to Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin at noon. Our  political correspondent Shlomo Raz reports from our Tel Aviv  studio:    A short time ago, an Israeli source very involved in the  Cairo talks, told us that a breakthrough or at last progress was  made in Egypt, which will permit the resumption of the  Gaza-Jericho talks next Tuesday. Progress was made on issues  which can be grouped under the term Palestinian security  problems, which surfaced due to the Hebron massacre, especially  on the establishment and deployment of a Palestinian police  force in Hebron. The force will be linked to the Palestinian  police force to be set up in Gaza and Jericho whose  establishment has already been agreed on. It will be associated  in some way with the Hebron Municipality, but will be  operationally subordinate to the IDF [Israel Defense Forces].  That was the main problem under discussion this past week and  once it has been resolved, the talks can now focus on the  resumption of the Gaza-Jericho talks. The police force will be  made up of several dozen Palestinian policemen, which as far as  is known, will be armed with revolvers for self-defense. They  will conduct joint patrols with the IDF and the foreign  observers Israel is prepared to have deployed in Hebron.    The prime minister said yesterday that the talks between  Israel and Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan will resume in late April,  unrelated to the talks with the PLO. We can therefore state  that the peace talks are making a great stride forward along all  tracks.     "

As a result, the situation on  the Korean peninsula is becoming alarming. Do you think that the  U.S.-North Korea talks and talks between the International  Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] and North Korea will be successful?    [Panov] Russia does not think that U.S.-North Korea talks  and IAEA-North Korea talks have been ruptured. Russia's  position is that the talks should continue. The North Korean  nuclear issue should be resolved under the IAEA's control for  peace and stability on the Korean peninsula. There were some  successes, although limited, in U.S.-North Korea talks in the  past. However, the talks were recently suspended and many  difficult problems are laid on the road toward a third round of  talks.    Russia is discussing the North Korean nuclear problem with  the United States and China, not to mention the ROK, and there  are no remarkable differences in the positions of each nation.    These nations share the view that North Korea should settle  nuclear negotiation with the IAEA at an early date and should  accept the nuclear inspection.    [Yi] What is your view on the possibility and prospects for  denuclearization of the Korean peninsula as discussed during  U.S.-Russia summit and talks between Russian and Chinese foreign  ministers?    [Panov] The only way toward the resolution of  denuclearization of the Korean peninsula at present is to bring  about concrete fruition in U.S.-North Korea talks and in  IAEA-North Korea talks. Although talks are very difficult and  may face a stumbling block, it is important to continue the  talks in a manner of dialogue.    [Yi] What is your opinion on the multilateral security  cooperation system proposed by the ROK for peace and stability  on the Korean peninsula?    [Panov] Russia basically supports this. This plan is a  method enabling one to resolve various problems pertaining to  security on the Korean peninsula, including the North Korean  nuclear issue. The relevant countries are making efforts to  achieve this plan.    The ROK established diplomatic relations with Russia and  China. What is left as a pending issue is North Korea's  normalization of relations with the United States and Japan. If  the North Korean nuclear problem is solved and normalization of  relations is achieved, an important progress will be registered  in efforts to promote security on the Korean peninsula and in  the Northeast Asia.    [Yi] Do you think the Kim Il-song-Kim Chong-il hereditary  system will proceed smoothly in North Korea?    [Panov] I debated on this issue with relevant American and  ROK figures when I served as Russian Ambassador in Seoul. We  have drawn a conclusion that it is difficult to predict how the  North Korean society will change in the future. Since North  Korea is an extremely closed society and flow of information is  restricted, analysis and assessment of the practical situation  on the progress of the hereditary system are very difficult.  However, international society shares the view that  stabilization in North Korea's political situation is important.    [Yi] When do you think President Kim Yong-sam will visit  Russia and what are the important agendas?    [Panov] Russia is hoping that President Kim will visit  within this year, and is preparing for this. We believe that  with President Kim's visit as an occasion, the two nations will  solve the pending issues including Russia's debt to the ROK, and  will further promote cooperation in various domains of relations  between the two countries including domains of politics,  economy, and culture.    [Yi] What is your opinion on the possibility of expanding  economic cooperation between the two countries and on proper  means for a solution to Russia's debt to the ROK?    [Panov] The amount of trade between the two countries last  year was $1.5 billion--a 40 percent increase from the previous  year--and the amount is expected to increase further. We are  well aware that because of uneasiness in the political situation  in Russia, ROK businessmen from small and medium-size  enterprises are reluctant to advance to Russia. However, Russia  will be stabilized in the future. For example in cooperative  relations between Russia and the ROK, a ROK firm advanced to  Russia's Far Eastern district through the introduction of the  Russian Embassy in the ROK, and established a joint-venture  textile plant there. This firm has earned a great amount of  interest by exporting its products to the United States. ROK  businessmen, who wish to advance to Russia, may inquire of  Russian Embassy in Seoul about method and procedure of advance.  Since reshuffle of Russian cabinet members was carried out  recently, I cannot tell you precisely at this moment about the  method as to how the Russian Government will resolve the issue  of its debt to the ROK and of its interest payment. At present,  relevant officials within the Russian Government are exchanging  their views on measures for solving the problem.     "

The British  presence in Ireland in incompatible with peace."" Would you  choose the same words again today?    [Adams] Of course, I would. Almost every day one can see  the failure of British politics in Ireland and the frustrated  experiment of division. The division did not work in Germany,  or anywhere else for that matter; certainly not here.    [Alioth] But the Unionist majority in Northern Ireland has  conclusively proven over the past 100 years that it will defy  any solution it does not like, even through the use of force.  Do you really want a united Ireland with 1 million alienated  rebels?    [Adams] One must take into account that the Unionists have  never stood on their own feet, but have always been dependent on  the British. When this state was founded, it was not the  Unionists, but the British who founded it. Consequently, we  Republicans demand that the Unionists stand on their own feet.  The Ireland that we want is not the exclusive miniature state  that we have here in the north, but a comprehensive one, in  which we will replace the terms Catholic and Protestant by  generally accepted civil rights of the island of Ireland on the  basis of equality. This requires the participation of the  Unionists.    [Alioth] In your view, what would change politically and in  everyday life if, tomorrow, the IRA were to publicly renounce  the use of violence?    [Adams] First of all, I regard it as most unlikely that the  IRA will do it. In a conflict one either beats the other side  or reaches a negotiated settlement. The British have admitted  that they are not able to beat the IRA militarily, and during  the past 15 years I have said that this is not a military  problem, which is where there cannot be a military solution, but  that there has to be a political solution. Last year, Sinn Fein  participated in a number of political initiatives, all of which  were aiming at a peace agreement, a negotiated settlement. We  talked to the British Government, there was the initiative  between me and Mr. Hume from the Social Democratic and Labour  Party [SDLP], and we met church leaders and other opinion  leaders in all of Ireland. We reached agreement among Northern  Irish Nationalists, which was supported by the government in  Dublin, and of which the IRA said that it might be a basis for  peace. All that led to the Downing Street Declaration of 15  December 1993, which was described by the British Government as  a first step toward a peaceful settlement. Therefore, it seems  quite unlikely to me that the IRA -- and neither the British or  the Loyalists -- might take unilateral action. The inner logic  of the situation and the development of the past 14 months point  to a multilateral negotiated settlement. Such a solution was  delayed and stopped in the past three, four months and has to be  followed up quickly now. This process will at one point lead to  a demilitarization, that is to say an end to armed activities  from all groups involved, including the IRA. This would, of  course, be a major step ahead, because we would thus be moving  toward a political solution.    [Alioth] In your opinion, what are the political  consequences of the IRA killing yet another policeman in  Northern Ireland?    [Adams] Meanwhile it sounds almost banal, like a cliche: I  think that, in this situation any casualty has to be regretted.  Every single casualty victim, whether it is a Royal Ulster  Constabulary [RUC] officer, a British soldier, or, as quite  recently, alleged members of Loyalist organizations, is  regrettable. We need demilitarization; this is something I have  always worked for. I have asked all parties involved to lay  down their arms -- the IRA, the British, the Loyalists. And I  have not changed my position. Last week we had the death of  Theresa Clinton, the wife of a Sinn Fein member; there were a  number of attacks against Catholics and the homes of Catholics.  The IRA killed a RUC man. And most recently, the IRA killed two  people, claiming that they were Loyalists. The families of all  these victims will feel exactly the same: pain. One could say  that Theresa Clinton had nothing to do with all that. She was a  woman, it was hard luck that she was married to a Republican,  while the RUC man was a responsible, armed voluntary member of  the British Armed Forces, and so on. Yet, I do not think that  such qualifications and half-justifications will bring things  ahead. We must make sure that the chances for peace are not  wasted. Whatever the justification or the circumstances of the  conflict up to the winter of 1993 may have been, in a situation  in which all sides claim to have the solution it is disgusting  that people keep getting killed.    [Alioth] Did you ever consider that the strategy of the IRA  and Sinn Fein of the past 20 years might have been  counterproductive; that Irish unity was delayed through people  becoming alienated with one another within Northern Ireland, and  the North becoming estranged from the South?    [Adams] It has not delayed unification of Ireland, which  would not even be on the agenda without the fight here in the  north. Yet, certain aspects of the IRA campaign were certainly  counterproductive, there can be no doubt. And the lasting --  let us say -- violence is repulsive to the people who live in  the middle of it here, as it is to outside observers. The  sooner armed activities cease, the sooner we will enter a  nonviolent phase of the struggle, which will be all the better  for all parties involved.    [Alioth] What to you tell people who claim that, after 20  years in the political desert, the Republicans had lost the  ability to evaluate their opponents' political room to maneuver.    [Adams] But that is certainly not the case. The mere fact  that the peace process exists at all, and that expectations have  been so high, prove the Republicans' readiness for dialogue with  their opponents, even with their enemies.    [Alioth] In the last five months you constantly asked the  British Government for ""clarification"" of the Downing Street  Declaration. Is this not simply a trick to press for a meeting  with a British negotiator before the IRA renounces the use of  force?    [Adams] Well, the term trick is quite an unlucky word in  this connection. Sinn Fein runs in the election, Sinn Fein wins  a seat. In the last municipal election we won 12.5 percent of  the vote, every third Nationalist supports our party. We are  the party that gets the most votes in Belfast, the country's  second biggest city, and we are the second biggest party in  Derry and elsewhere in the six counties. It is not a trick to  try and win a mandate, to get it, and then represent those from  one received this mandate. I think that this is called  democracy. The other parties asked for clarification and, quite  correctly, got it. Every party did, sometimes even from Dublin  and London. After all, it is our duty first of all to find out  what the declaration is all about, because it can be -- and that  is probably the intention behind it -- interpreted differently.  I did not say anything about it in the past 10 days, and I am  become sick only when I hear the word ""clarification."" I think  that we are now in a crisis. When the British stonewall, reject  any development, then everything will freeze, the Loyalists will  step up their murderous campaign, the British will intensify  military occupation. At Easter, the IRA suspended its  activities for a few days to support a clarification. This was  at a time when the Republicans were trying to be flexible and  facilitate demilitarization, while what we have got is  militarization. Then the IRA will, of course, take action  again, and we are finding ourselves in the situation in which  the entire peace process threatens to disintegrate.    [Alioth] Sometimes you give the impression that you would  like to be more peaceful and conciliatory than you turn out to  be.    [Adams] I would be a fool if I were not seeking peace. All  of us, our children, our neighbors, have the desire to live in  relative peace. I have lived in this conflict all my life.  This is why I think that my longing for peace is maybe greater  than that of others who do not live here. It is easy to make  peace with friends, but it is absolutely difficult to do so with  enemies. I am not interested in a temporary or partial peace.  What we need -- and I am deliberately using the term -- is  lasting peace, a lasting solution. I am convinced that we will  get peace. I am convinced that the entire thrust of the fight  points toward peace. Things are going too slowly, and it is  frustrating to me that we have once more become hostages of the  right wing of the British Conservatives, and that Mr. Major is  prevented from providing clarifications to Sinn Fein. As far as  I am concerned this is unbearable. We have to be patient and  hold out. If John Major did not have his internal difficulties,  how much further would he have gotten? All this indicates that  a more stable British Government would deal with these central  problems more comprehensively than has been the case in the  past. The Republicans have always started from the assumption  that the British will only consider the democratic option  reluctantly, only when every other way out is blocked.     "

As a result,  the situation on the Korean peninsula is becoming alarming. Do  you think that the U.S.-North Korea talks and talks between the  International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] and North Korea will  be successful?    [Panov] Russia does not think that U.S.-North Korea talks  and IAEA-North Korea talks have been ruptured. Russia's  position is that the talks should continue. The North Korean  nuclear issue should be resolved under the IAEA's control for  peace and stability on the Korean peninsula. There were some  successes, although limited, in U.S.-North Korea talks in the  past. However, the talks were recently suspended and many  difficult problems are laid on the road toward a third round of  talks.    Russia is discussing the North Korean nuclear problem with  the United States and China, not to mention the ROK, and there  are no remarkable differences in the positions of each nation.    These nations share the view that North Korea should settle  nuclear negotiation with the IAEA at an early date and should  accept the nuclear inspection.    [Yi] What is your view on the possibility and prospects for  denuclearization of the Korean peninsula as discussed during  U.S.-Russia summit and talks between Russian and Chinese foreign  ministers?    [Panov] The only way toward the resolution of  denuclearization of the Korean peninsula at present is to bring  about concrete fruition in U.S.-North Korea talks and in  IAEA-North Korea talks. Although talks are very difficult and  may face a stumbling block, it is important to continue the  talks in a manner of dialogue.    [Yi] What is your opinion on the multilateral security  cooperation system proposed by the ROK for peace and stability  on the Korean peninsula?    [Panov] Russia basically supports this. This plan is a  method enabling one to resolve various problems pertaining to  security on the Korean peninsula, including the North Korean  nuclear issue. The relevant countries are making efforts to  achieve this plan.    The ROK established diplomatic relations with Russia and  China. What is left as a pending issue is North Korea's  normalization of relations with the United States and Japan. If  the North Korean nuclear problem is solved and normalization of  relations is achieved, an important progress will be registered  in efforts to promote security on the Korean peninsula and in  the Northeast Asia.    [Yi] Do you think the Kim Il-song-Kim Chong-il hereditary  system will proceed smoothly in North Korea?    [Panov] I debated on this issue with relevant American and  ROK figures when I served as Russian Ambassador in Seoul. We  have drawn a conclusion that it is difficult to predict how the  North Korean society will change in the future. Since North  Korea is an extremely closed society and flow of information is  restricted, analysis and assessment of the practical situation  on the progress of the hereditary system are very difficult.  However, international society shares the view that  stabilization in North Korea's political situation is important.    [Yi] When do you think President Kim Yong-sam will visit  Russia and what are the important agendas?    [Panov] Russia is hoping that President Kim will visit  within this year, and is preparing for this. We believe that  with President Kim's visit as an occasion, the two nations will  solve the pending issues including Russia's debt to the ROK, and  will further promote cooperation in various domains of relations  between the two countries including domains of politics,  economy, and culture.    [Yi] What is your opinion on the possibility of expanding  economic cooperation between the two countries and on proper  means for a solution to Russia's debt to the ROK?    [Panov] The amount of trade between the two countries last  year was $1.5 billion--a 40 percent increase from the previous  year--and the amount is expected to increase further. We are  well aware that because of uneasiness in the political situation  in Russia, ROK businessmen from small and medium-size  enterprises are reluctant to advance to Russia. However, Russia  will be stabilized in the future. For example in cooperative  relations between Russia and the ROK, a ROK firm advanced to  Russia's Far Eastern district through the introduction of the  Russian Embassy in the ROK, and established a joint-venture  textile plant there. This firm has earned a great amount of  interest by exporting its products to the United States. ROK  businessmen, who wish to advance to Russia, may inquire of  Russian Embassy in Seoul about method and procedure of advance.  Since reshuffle of Russian cabinet members was carried out  recently, I cannot tell you precisely at this moment about the  method as to how the Russian Government will resolve the issue  of its debt to the ROK and of its interest payment. At present,  relevant officials within the Russian Government are exchanging  their views on measures for solving the problem.     "

'It is not just the end of war but the beginning of new co-operation,' Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, told the 5,000 guests. 'Let's dream together. We've got the licence.' The treaty demarcates the two countries' borders, resolving disputed water claims and fixing security and environmental arrangements. The two nations will exchange ambassadors within a month and begin ambitious joint economic projects. President Bill Clinton, who attended the ceremony, praised King Hussein of Jordan and Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, and said the treaty had broken the chains that had kept the two countries in the shadow of strife and suffering. 'Here in this region which is the home of not only both your faiths but mine I say: Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall inherit the earth,' said Mr Clinton, who signed the treaty along with Mr Rabin and Mr Abdul-Salam al-Majali. Mr Rabin said: 'The peace that was born today gives us all the hope that the children born today will never know war between us and their mothers will know no sorrow.' Symbolic gestures of reconciliation between former warriors dominated the open-air ceremony. One Israeli in a wheelchair, wounded by Jordanians in the 1967 battle for Jerusalem, wept as Israeli and Jordanian marching bands rubbed shoulders and played their respective national anthems. An Israeli girl and a Jordanian girl, whose grandfathers were killed in the 1967 war, gave flowers to Mr Rabin, King Hussein and Mr Clinton. The Israeli and Jordanian chiefs of staff together with commanders of the air force, navy and southern fronts shook hands and exchanged gifts. But even as the ceremony took place, Jewish settlers claimed that Arab gunmen had kidnapped an Israeli youth in the West Bank, while Palestinians opposed to the treaty held rallies across the West Bank and burnt pictures of King Hussein. The Lebanese Islamic extremist Hizbollah group sent mortar fire crashing into northern Israel and denounced the treaty as 'a grand crime and treachery'. Mark Nicholson adds from Cairo: Earlier yesterday, Mr Clinton held talks in Cairo with President Hosni Mubarak, the Egyptian leader, and Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, after which the US president said he was satisfied with Mr Arafat's undertakings to combat the threat to the peace process posed by Hamas, the militant Islamic Palestinian group. Calling this a 'matter of great urgency', Mr Clinton told reporters that he received a 'very firm and unambiguous response' from the Palestinian leader. 'Chairman Arafat said he would continue to do all that he could to combat terrorism, specifically Hamas, but other groups as well. I'm satisfied with the response that he gave.' Mr Clinton added: 'I believe that he understands that Hamas is his enemy now and that once you become a partner in the peace process, you have to fight for peace.' Mr Arafat slipped away from the talks before yesterday's press conference. The US president also said he would head economic efforts to help Israel and the Palestinians during the next phases of their peace agreement.

0,FT934-3388 ,"FT934-3388 _AN-DLIC6AB2FT 931209   FT  09 DEC 93 / Political Notebook: Peace at Christmas?      By PHILIP STEPHENS   A new Anglo-Irish declaration by Christmas. Yes. But, peace by Christmas. Who knows? Such is the assessment of an informed insider in Mr John Major's government on the precarious search for a settlement in Northern Ireland. The judgment is a more interesting than it looks. For a start it would have been hard to imagine only a few weeks ago that a senior minister would be talking even about the possibility of an end to 25 years of IRA terrorism. Now, for all the embarrassment which followed the disclosure of Britain's clandestine contacts with Sinn Fein, ministers are still taking seriously the prospect that the IRA may be about to throw in the towel. All sorts of people in Whitehall are talking about how the IRA's middle-aged leadership has been shaken by the unthinking brutality of the latest wave of loyalist terrorism. It despairs at the future facing its children. Others assert with confidence that if the IRA's council called an end to violence, any renegade units would be dealt with. The IRA, we are told, has a disciplined command structure and central control of all its main arms dumps. Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, is more optimistic still. He believes a form of words which pays a little more than lip-service to the aspirations of Irish nationalism will persuade the gunmen to emerge from the shadows. He was furious when he discovered that Mr Major had been in continuous dialogue with Sinn Fein for most of this year and, probably, for a great deal longer. But the squall has passed. Mr Reynolds, according to British intelligence, has had his own contacts with the republican leadership. So the two leaders have been going line-by-line through the draft of their proposed joint declaration. By the end of last week's meeting about two-thirds of a document running to three or four pages in total had been agreed. The difficult bits were left for this week's second meeting in Brussels and, perhaps, for a third in London next week. But further progress has been made during talks among officials. The sticking points have been well-rehearsed. The main one centres on finding language to reconcile the nationalist demand for Irish self-determination with the British guarantee of the unionist veto in the north. Mr Reynolds wants provision in the joint statement that any permanent political settlement would be subject to concurrent referenda in the south and north. He wants also an all-Ireland convention to give form to the south's legitimate interest in the affairs of the north. That, along with British recognition of the legitimacy or validity of unity (Mr Major has baulked at 'value'), would represent a nod in Sinn Fein's direction. For his part Mr Major will get an unequivocal Irish commitment to the 'consent' principle in Northern Ireland: de facto recognition of the unionist veto over any constitutional change. Mr Reynolds is also ready to include a pledge that part of a longer-term political settlement would be the removal from its constitution of the republic's legal claim to Northern Ireland. If that - along with another offer to Sinn Fein to join negotiations once it had renounced violence - represents the structure of the eventual joint statement, there is still plenty of argument to come. In Anglo-Irish relations the devil is in the language. Words such as self-determination or joint authority are loaded with sinister implications for the unionists. Mr Major can do nothing without at least tacit support from them. Mr Major has told Mr Reynolds he is prepared to reaffirm Britain's studied neutrality over the ultimate future of the province. The lesson of recent weeks is that the exasperation of the British people with Northern Ireland has provided the prime minister with an opportunity to take more risks with unionist opinion than most of his predecessors. But some things - words such as self-determination and a permanent all-Ireland convention are among them - move too far in the direction of the nationalists. Mr James Molyneaux, the Ulster Unionist party leader, has told Mr Major he will not have it. So different words and phrases will have to be found. By the end of the process - probably next week - there will be plenty of rhetorical contortions to allow Dublin to say it has met the aspirations of the nationalists and London to say it has safeguarded unionist opinion. There is danger though in such dilution. Sinn Fein and the IRA may conclude there is no incentive to join negotiations. In addition, the message to unionists may be sufficiently disconcerting to prompt a further upsurge in loyalist terrorism. Sadly, declarations offer no guarantee of peace.

0,FT943-5818 ,"FT943-5818 _AN-EICAFAARFT 940902   FT  02 SEP 94 / European Profile: Lesson for man who hopes to tame Eta - The Spanish justice minister's anti-terrorist policy appears to have backfired      By TOM BURNS   While the IRA ceasefire nudges the British and Irish governments towards framing a peace settlement for Northern Ireland, politicians in Spain are at odds over how to deal with Eta, the Basque separatist organisation which to date has given no sign of ending a campaign of violence that, like Ulster's, stretches back 25 years. The row centres on a discreet partial parole policy for selected members of the 525-strong jail population of Eta members - a terrorist prison count that bears comparison with that of Northern Ireland. This policy is sponsored by Mr Juan Alberto Belloch who in May added the responsibilities of the Interior Ministry to his existing job of justice minister. An independently-minded magistrate before he joined the socialist government last year and now considered one of the most influential members of Mr Felipe Gonzalez's cabinet, Mr Belloch has discovered that dealing with Eta as a minister is a lot more complicated than passing sentences on the group's gunmen in a courtroom. His partial parole policy, which has been fiercely rejected by the conservative Partido Popular opposition and has had no immediate impact on Eta's commitment to violence, threatens to derail both his own reputation as a minister and the Spanish parliament's long-standing bi-partisan approach to terror-ism. Mr Belloch seeks with his initiative to hasten the end of Eta by denting the separatist organisation's 'patriots behind bars' propaganda. Critics contend that the policy risks allowing Eta to raise its operational ability by regrouping released gunmen and by attracting new recruits on the grounds that the government is 'soft' on terrorism. Known as the Biministrio because of his dual ministerial responsibilities, Mr Belloch had a second successive day of talks yesterday with opposition parties in preparation for a formal all-party of meeting this month which will attempt to re-establish a consensus on counter-terrorism policy. Mr Belloch faced hostile questioning in parliament a month ago when he admitted that 14 Eta members, who were not named but are understood to be serving long sentences on murder counts, had received partial paroles which allow them out of prison during daytime and at weekends. The controversy over the disclosure of the policy coincided with an Eta bomb attack in Madrid that killed one of Spain's key army officers, General Francisco Veguillas who as director-general of defence policy had played a key role in the modernisation of Spain's armed forces. Mr Belloch was accused in parliament of failing to consult the opposition over his initiative and of breaking a formal understanding that any partial freedoms for jailed Eta members would only follow a sustained ceasefire by the separatist organisation. 'The (bi-partisan) agreement was that while Eta continued to kill, Etarras would go to prison, not leave it,' said the conservative opposition spokesman, Mr Federico Trillo. The row over the prison policy continued during August as youths sympathetic to Eta clashed with security forces during the Basque region's summer fiestas. Earlier this week, on the peak day for returning holidaymakers, Eta showed its muscle again when it took a leaf from the IRA's violence manual and bombed railway tracks linking the cities of Pamplona and Zaragoza. As one of the chief legal officers in Bilbao, the main city in the Basque region before he became a minister, Mr Belloch balanced stiff sentences for Eta gunmen with a close watch on the possible maltreatment of separatist suspects. He took a particularly strong line in supporting fellow magistrates investigating a celebrated case concerning police involvement in a shadowy anti-Eta death squad. To the minister's acute embarrassment, the initial details of his controversial partial parole initiative coincided with the extension of similar partial freedom privileges to two former police officers who in 1991 received 108-year sentences for their part in the anti-Eta death squad. Mr Belloch knew both men well from his days as a magistrate in Bilbao. The minister hotly denied that the former policemen had gained a partial parole in exchange for remaining silent over the government's alleged involvement in the 'dirty war' against the separatists. Mr Belloch argued that by extending an olive branch to members of Eta who had shown good conduct in jail he could drive a wedge between those who wanted to break with the violence and those who remained hard-core terrorists. The storm created over his initiative has now prompted Mr Belloch into hawkish language. 'While I am minister there will be no relationships, no negotiations, no dialogue, no taking of any temperatures and no contact of any kind with the terrorists,' he said after meeting the conservative party spokesman on security affairs.

The shooting, the first since the IRA and Loyalist paramilitaries declared ceasefires, cast a shadow over the Northern Ireland peace process. It will almost certainly increase pressure on London and Dublin to step up their efforts to secure a dismantling of paramilitary arsenals. Dublin's decision to cancel the early release orders for the IRA prisoners was announced by Mrs Maire Geoghegan-Quinn, the Irish justice minister, after a meeting with Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister. Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, said he was 'deeply angered' by the 'callous and wicked' murder. There would be 'very natural suspicions' as to the motive for the crime. The attack took place in Newry. Three armed men, dressed as postmen and using a post office van, entered a fenced sorting centre. An employee was shot dead. Two of the men were arrested after a chase involving helicopters near the Irish border. The third escaped and was last night being sought by the Royal Ulster Constabulary. The RUC said the two men arrested were reported to be known republicans. But Sinn Fein indicated last night that the raid was not the work of the IRA and did not represent a breach of the two-month-old ceasefire. Republican sources in South Armagh, a strongly nationalist area, said the raid was the work of renegade, freelance republicans commiting a straightforward criminal act. Mr Gerry Adams, the president of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, was reported to be 'visibly shaken' when told the news by a reporter. He said: 'The RUC is engaged in a transparent attempt to damage the peace process.' A statement from the IRA said: 'On August 31 the IRA announced a complete cessation of military operations . . . This position has not changed.' Yesterday's killing came on the eve of a meeting between British and Irish officials to discuss the framework document which the two governments hope will form the basis of a durable political settlement in the province. Sir Patrick and Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, are to discuss the document in the Republic of Ireland on Monday. There have been signs in recent days that the two governments have made progress - particularly in the area of north-south relations - after a period of little progress. British and Irish politicians said the shooting showed the need for a rapid surrender of weapons. Mr Seamus Mallon, MP for Newry for the moderate nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party, said: 'All we do know for certain is that these people had a certain close relationship with the IRA, that they had weapons, and they had very clearly planned this operation . . . the same kind of operation they have used before.' His view was echoed by Mr David Trimble, Ulster Unionist party spokesman on legal affairs. He said: 'Freelance operations don't take place in that area unless they're licensed by the IRA.'

The British and Irish governments, in spite of the almost daily mantra declaring the peace process waits for no one, would also prefer to talk. The two sides, to the embarrassment of the British government, have already done so. But how to get there again without one or the other losing face is the dilemma now confronting both. Unless there is a way through, the conflict could be set for another long, bloody phase. London and Dublin stand apparently indivisible in their determination not to talk to terrorists until the violence ends. Dublin, always more ready than London to offer explanation of the joint Downing Street declaration, believes there is no more room for further clarification and is increasingly contemptuous of the republican position. Sunday's equivocal, late-night statement from the IRA - issued from Dublin and signed by the apparently flexible if fictitious 'P. O'Neill' of the Irish Republican Publicity Bureau - avoids an explicit rejection of December's Downing Street declaration. But it leaves the chances of lasting peace as elusive as ever. The triple onslaught at Heathrow airport - arguably attracting more column inches and political outrage at Westminster than would a dozen murders in Ulster - taken together with the IRA's first formal response to the declaration, seem to provide a clearer picture of the next, presumably agreed, phase in republican strategy. The mortars at Heathrow - irrespective of whether they were doctored to minimise injuries - were not to be a final flexing of military muscle before a ceasefire. The attacks can be seen as part of the pattern of 'spectaculars' predicted by Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president. They are likely to continue. The IRA and Sinn Fein clearly believe the British government can eventually be made to give further ground. The prime objective of republicans now is to return to the position nearly a year ago when, after lengthy, secret contacts between the two sides, they believed the British government was preparing for detailed peace talks. But if peace is on its mind, the republican movement appears convinced that  -having made considerable progress while violence continues - it can expect the two governments to give further ground under duress. The IRA's Dublin statement, greeted variously as a sign of hope or of contemptible cynicism, blames the 'negative attitude' of the British government for lack of progress. The mortars have triggered renewed calls for the government to do something to re-energise the London-Dublin initiative, while underlining how limited are ministers' options for mounting an instant military or political response. London's desire for rapid progress on political talks has been stymied both by the tendency of the constitutional parties to retreat to entrenched positions in readiness for June's European elections and by Dublin's reluctance to show its hand over relations between north and south. On security, any dramatic response by London - such as internment - is ruled out. Besides handing the IRA a propaganda victory, it would give the lie to past assertions that co-operation between London and Dublin on such matters is already extremely good. Downing Street yesterday signalled some fresh efforts in this area by revealing that new discussions with Dublin aimed at making co-operation 'even more effective' would urgently take place at official level. The government yesterday restated its position that there would be no negotiations before the IRA ended its armed campaign. But whatever it says in public, further secret contacts with republican leaders can never be ruled out. When last year's sequence of secret messages between London and the republican movement was exposed in November, Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, insisted that these had not amounted to negotiation, a formula which could be repeated. But whatever the next step, it can now be seen that the Downing Street declaration - irrespective of its longer-term value - has failed to make an early breakthrough in the search for peace. The prize remains great but the fight seems nowhere near over.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P9721 International Affairs.   Types:-  NEWS  General News.

Visiting Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias told  Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic today that the proposal  includes two points: To demilitarize Sarajevo and put it under  U.N. mandate for two years; and to press the Muslim side to  accept the European Union peace plan which divides Bosnia into  three ethnic states.    Milosevic and Papoulias agreed that any air strike on  Serbian  positions will undermine the Bosnian peace talks and will only  encourage what they called ""militants"" to continue to refuse  peace and prolong the war.    Papoulias also handed over a letter from Greek Prime  Minister  Andreas Papandreou to Milosevic.    Greece was the only NATO member country to oppose issuing an  ultimatum to the warring Bosnian sides to remove their weapons  from around Sarajevo at the NATO meeting last Wednesday [9  February] in Brussels.    Papoulias promised to do his best, while serving as the  chairman of the European Union's ministerial meeting, to avoid  the worst -- air strikes.    He said air strikes will not help bring about peace in  Bosnia, and a political settlement will benefit not only the  Balkans, but also the whole of Europe.    It is not fair to only ask the Serbian side to withdraw  weapons from around Sarajevo, he said, adding that the Muslim  side should also be pressed to withdraw their weapons.     "

Serb military leaders in Krajina claimed as many as 20,000 Croat troops were massing in UN Sector West in central Croatia, which has so far been peaceful. UN officials said they were aware of the reports, but warned that peacekeepers were prepared to defend the year-long ceasefire line. The fighting in Croatia came as diplomatic efforts to end the fighting in neighbouring Bosnia moved from Geneva to UN headquarters in New York. Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, peace talks co-chairmen, met Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, in New York last night. In Brussels, EC foreign ministers yesterday gave their 'full and unequivocal support' to the Vance-Owen peace plan for Bosnia-Hercegovina, and called on the UN security council to back up what they called a 'coherent and comprehensive settlement'. Officials admitted, however, that there had been no substantive discussion on how to implement and enforce the plan. There was also strong support for convening a tribunal to judge war crimes committed in former Yugoslavia, spurred by discussion yesterday of the report by Dame Anne Warburton on the use of rape - particularly against Bosnian Moslem women - as a weapon. Ministers and officials brushed aside suggestions that the Vance-Owen plan might be seen to endorse land-grabs by Serbia which could set precedents in other disputes in eastern and central Europe and the former Soviet Union. In Krajina, Serb military leaders said Croatia had launched a 'general offensive' along a 25km arc stretching from Obrovac in the north to Skradin in the south, 11 days after Croat forces pushed across UN lines. UN officials confirmed reports of tank and artillery duels in the area around the Serb-held town of Benkovac, in UN Sector South, one of four UN protected areas comprising Serb enclaves. Tension was also growing in Sector East, which includes Vukovar, the town devasted by the Yugoslav army during the seven-month war over Croatian independence. The upsurge in fighting came as the fate of the Bosnian peace talks yesterday hung in the balance. Mr Alija Izetbegovic, Moslem president of Bosnia, said he would boycott the talks, proposed for New York.   Countries:-  YUZ  Yugoslavia, East Europe.   Industries:-  P9711  National Security.

His intervention is a clear indication of concern at the highest levels of the German government over the damage done to the country's international reputation by the row over the alleged theft of industrial secrets. Chancellor Helmut Kohl, as well as Mr Rexrodt himself, has already publicly urged the two sides to settle their differ-ences. Mr Rexrodt invited Mr David Herman, chairman of Adam Opel, for talks at the economics ministry in Bonn last night and he has agreed on a similar meeting with Mr Ferdinand Piech, the VW chairman, to be held on Friday. Both companies have agreed to the discussions. A ministry spokeswoman said Mr Rexrodt was not seeking to mediate directly in the dispute, in which GM has accused VW of industrial espionage and the theft of confidential documents. 'He is merely seeking to inform himself about the situation, and about the arguments on both sides,' she said. 'He is very concerned about the situation.' The move was immediately welcomed by VW as a step towards peace talks between the two companies. They have been at loggerheads since Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, former global purchasing director for GM, defected to VW in March. GM accused Mr Lopez and several associates of systematically plundering industrial secrets before their departure. There was less enthusiasm from senior officials at Opel, who insist that before the two companies can sit down together Mr Piech must withdraw what Opel sees as anti-American accusations against GM, and his suggestion that the US company was somehow responsible for planting its secret documents on VW employees. In a furious outburst last month, Mr Piech suggested GM was trying to damage VW in a commercially motivated war. This week he underscored his commitment to his production director, repeating that he would 'put my hand in the fire' for Mr Lopez. Opel officials added yesterday that the company would not enter peace talks while the German legal authorities were in the middle of an investigation into allegations of theft, industrial espionage and fraud.

Hata met with Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin in  the morning and later held talks with his Russian Counterpart  Andrey Kozyrev. He also met with state Duma (lower house of  parliament) Chairman Ivan Rybkin in the afternoon.    Discussing the outcome of his talks with Russian leaders in  the final day of his visit, the Japanese minister confirmed that  the two sides had agreed to promote economic cooperation.    Japan will grant Russia a credit of 200 million U.S. dollars  through the export-import bank for the construction of a  fiber-optic communication line between Moscow and Russia's far  eastern city of Khabarovsk.    Hata told Russian leaders that Japan will aid Russia in  creating a number of training centers for market reforms in  Moscow and the Far East, and for developing oil and gas fields  on the Sakhalin shelf.    He also said that Japan, together with the European Bank for  Reconstruction and Development, will establish a 50 million  dollar fund for aiding Russia's medium-sized and small  enterprises.    Moreover, the two sides agreed in principle to hold defense  and security exchanges, stressing that cooperation between Tokyo  and Moscow will have a ""favorable impact"" not only on the Asia  Pacific region, but also on the rest of the world.    Both sides shared the views on the current ""alarming  situation"" caused by the nuclear issue in the Korean Peninsula,  and said they stand for making the region a nuclear-free zone.    After their meeting, both Hata and Kozyrev told reporters  they had ""detailed and constructive talks on a broad spectrum of  bilateral problems and some international issues, ""stressing  that Japan and Russia have developed ""very good relations.""    However, the long dispute over the northern territory issue  was only touched upon and no progress was made.    ""We do not avoid discussions on these problems,"" Kozyrev  said, adding that these issues will be thoroughly discussed at  future meetings on the basis of the ""Tokyo declaration"" signed  during President Boris Yeltsin's visit to Japan last October.    The Japanese minister pointed out that in order to improve  bilateral relations it is necessary to conclude a peace treaty  and resolve the territorial dispute as soon as possible.    He called for a step by step advance toward a settlement of  the territorial dispute.    Chernomyrdin told Hata during their morning talks that  Russia  ""will not act with haste"" in handling this dispute, left over  from the Second World War.    The four islands were occupied by the Soviet troops towards  the end of the war.    ""One way or another we will move towards the signing of a  peace treaty between our countries,"" the Russian premier stated.    Before leaving Russia, Hata also agreed to set a date for  Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's visit to Moscow.     "

He said: 'The prospects for peace and a durable political settlement in Northern Ireland today trembles in the balance as a result of what is now revealed as at best stupidity and at worst duplicity by the prime minister and the government.' The Rev Ian Paisley (above), Democratic Unionist party leader (below), said he was devastated the government had been talking to the IRA while publicly denying it.

There was a 'chain of communication', but he insisted there had been no negotiation and no talks. Mr John Hume (above), leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party (below), told BBC Radio 4: 'I am trying to face up to the real problem in Northern Ireland, and that problem is of a divided people. It cannot be solved by a victory of one side over the other.'

In what a UN official decribed as a 'critical, high-stakes' mission, Mr Boutros Ghali will meet Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic and Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and lay out the conditions for the continuation of the UN operation in Bosnia. He will try to broker a ceasefire in the war-torn territory, and, in particular, around Bihac, the north-western Moslem enclave, where infantry clashes yesterday were reported to the west of the UN 'safe area'. Mr Boutros Ghali is expected to meet an angry reception in Sarajevo, where many resent the UN's failure to lift the 32-month Serb siege. His last visit in December 1992 is remembered bitterly for his remarks that he could think of a dozen places even worse than Sarajevo. His visit coincides with intense diplomatic efforts to overcome deep splits in the international community over Bosnia and to resume the peace process. In a bid to get the Bosnian Serbs to return to the bargaining table, meanwhile, envoys from the five-nation contact group yesterday also travelled to Sarajevo, for talks with the Moslem-led Bosnian government. The representatives - from the US, Russia, Germany, France and the UK - were also due to meet Bosnian Serb leaders for the first time since they rejected a western peace plan - a partition of Bosnia - in July. This meeting followed talks with President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia in Belgrade on Monday. Despite diplomatic strains placed on the contact group by criticism from the US of the efficacy of the UN's military role in Bosnia, the international mediators appear to hold out hope of reviving their peace plan to divide Bosnia roughly in half between the Moslem-Croat federation and the Bosnian Serbs, who control 70 per cent of the war-torn country. The peace process will get an additional boost when Serb rebels from Croatia sign an agreement on Thursday on restoring economic links with Zagreb, the Croat capital. A close associate of Mr Milosevic yesterday said Belgrade would maintain a direct link with Serb-held territory in Croatia, which would step up pressure on the Bosnian Serbs to sign a peace deal. But the Bosnian Serb leadership, which over the past two weeks has revelled in the eruption of a serious transatlantic feud over Bosnia, is waiting for territorial concessions. Mr Milosevic this week has signalled that he is pushing for Bosnian Serbs to negotiate land swaps on a bilateral basis. Mr Mirko Pejanovic, an ethnic Serb member of Bosnia's collective presidency, disclosed in London that he had been in touch with aides to Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister. Mr Pejanovic - who contests the right of Mr Karadzic to speak for Bosnian Serbs - said he had put to Russian officials the concerns of the 200,000 Serbs who live in Bosnian government-controlled territory. Russia has strong traditional ties with the Serbs and big diplomatic presence in Croatia, but until recently its lines of communications with the Bosnian leadership have been weak.

The face-to-face talks between Moslems, Serbs and Croats were proposed by the Bosnian Serb leader, Mr Radovan Karadzic, after his self-styled Serb parliament had rejected a map drawn up by Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, UN and EC negotiators, dividing Bosnia into 10 semi-autonomous provinces. While admitting he had hoped the parliament's declaration would be 'a little less tough and more positive towards the plan,' Mr Karadzic denied it had been entirely turned down. 'We accept the positive achievement of the Vance-Owen plan so far and we expect to correct the maps through direct talks face-to-face with the sides to the conflict,' he said in an interview with Reuter TV. Mr Izetbegovic, however, told reporters in Sarajevo yesterday that Mr Karadzic was up to his usual 'games and tricks', and that he was confident the international community would see through them. 'It is a rejection (of the plan) and nothing less,' he said. After reluctantly signing the peace plan himself last month, Mr Izetbegovic had made it clear he would withdraw his signature unless the Bosnian Serbs endorsed the Vance-Owen plan unchanged. Meanwhile, a ceasefire agreed a week ago broke down at the weekend, leaving at least seven dead and 28 wounded in the Bosnian capital Sarajevo. Fighting was also reported around the besieged Moslem town of Srebrenica in eastern Bosnia. Lieutenant-General Lars-Eric Wahlgren, commander of UN forces in Bosnia, called on Bosnian Serbs to stop besieging the town and to respect the ceasefire. Local Moslem leaders yesterday refused to allow a UN aid convoy to evacuate refugees from Srebrenica. Moslem leaders have indicated they believe such evacuation would contribute to the Serbs' policy of expelling Moslems from areas which Serbs want to claim as their own. Eight trucks, which delivered 75 tonnes of food to the stricken town which is within range of Serb gun positions, left empty. Hardline members of the Bosnian Serb parliament forced through a declaration on Saturday which made clear that the Vance-Owen map, which would reduce the territory allocated to the Serbs from the 70 per cent of the total surface of Bosnia which they occupy now to 43 per cent, was 'unacceptable'. Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, also said in Vancouver at the weekend that he thought there was still a possibility the peace plan could be adjusted to meet Serb concerns. Describing the Bosnian Serb decision as 'regrettable', he nevertheless believed they had left the door open and that efforts should continue to try to persuade them it was in their and the world's interest 'to bring this slaughter' to an end. 'We're not ready to give up,' Mr Christopher said. The tone of his remarks was noticeably more conciliatory than his previous statements about punitive sanctions against the Serbs, probably in deference to Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, who was attending a summit with US President Bill Clinton in Vancouver.

He said in a statement that he doubts that Damascus  is prepared for real peace.    It is natural that Peres has no evidence of this, while the  whole world has proof that Israel not only rejects peace, but  seeks to sabotage it, divide its basic concepts, and besiege its  objectives. It does this so that peace, which the world thinks  should be comprehensive and just, is transformed into incomplete  deals and separate and paralyzed agreements that preserve the  occupation and strengthen hegemony, and entrenches aggression  against the Arabs -- aggression which has been continuing since  1948.    The Israel that continues to launch blatant aggressions  against south Lebanon in the atmosphere of peace for which the  international community has aspired, does not want peace. The  Israel that kidnaps a Lebanese citizen, while he was safe among  his family and children in a condemned act of piracy, does not  want peace. The Israel that looks at the comprehensive peace  process through narrow holes, and draws weak parties to the  cycle of its interests, and exploits them for its objectives,  does not want peace. It seeks to sabotage peace and to empty it  of its just humanitarian contents. Israel seeks to change peace  into mere deals between two parties: one that dictates, and one  that submissively signs under the pretext of international  circumstances and developments that cannot be confronted.    These are some of Israel's practices aimed at aborting the  peace process. These practices emphasize that Israel  understands peace far from its reality, and believes in it away  from the facts of the region and logic. Israel wants to isolate  parties, and then replace the comprehensive solution with  partial solutions that serve its concept of peace and its  interests while continuing the occupation and dictating other  conditions that serve its future aggressive objectives.  Regrettably, Israel has realized what it wants, due to Arab  division and the weakness of certain parties and individuals as  a result of shortsightedness, limited vision, and weakness of  their pan-Arab affiliation and understanding of the objectives  which the Arab people aspire to realize.    Nevertheless, while Syria is seeking to realize  comprehensive  and just peace it will never relinquish a grain of sand or a  single right whether Peres casts doubts or not. No progress in  the peace talks will be made unless Israel stops these practices  and responds to the requisites of comprehensive peace, foremost  of which is full withdrawal from the land to the borders of 4  June 1967 as one of the pillars of real peace--peace whose  requisites were understood by the whole world, not the peace  that Peres speaks about and wants. Peres is fully aware that  Syria wants peace, and this peace does not cope at all with  Israel's aggressive aspirations, but it restricts these  aspirations in a manner that corrects things and restores just  balances. This is how peace can be realized, and without this  there will be no peace.     "

The paper adds: What makes things uncomfortable is that Mr.  Christopher begins his new tour of the region with the statement  issued by his department on terrorism and the states which  protect terrorism, in which the name of Syria, along with the  names of other states, was included. This is not a good and  appropriate beginning, especially since the U.S. State  Department's statement is unrealistic and based on many  fallacies, in addition to the fact that it is hostile and  provocative.    AL-BA'TH says: If this statement is meant to pressure Syria,  Syria has never yielded and will never yield to pressures from  any one.    The paper adds: We would have hoped and wished that  Secretary Christopher had not sent this statement as an opening  message concerning efforts to reactivate the peace process.  This is because this is an improper message and the address to  which it was sent is completely wrong.    The paper says: Christopher is returning to the region based  on his statements that he has positive ideas on the  Syrian-Israeli track. Undoubtedly, everyone who loves just and  comprehensive peace hopes that Christopher will something in his  quiver that justifies his optimistic tone, and that the ideas he  is talking about will be based on U.S. success in persuading the  intransigent side which is rebelling against the international  legitimacy; namely Israel, to accept the indispensable bases of  making progress toward a just and comprehensive peace.    The paper stresses that Christopher will find in Syria every  concern about a just and comprehensive peace, and sincere  cooperation to put the peace process on the road leading to this  peace.    Concluding its editorial, AL-BA'TH says: Syria is working  for peace in the open. It will not accept a humiliating peace.  Moreover, it will not do anything that would be shameful to  announce. It is either an honorable and just peace or no peace.    Under the headlines ""The Basis for Peace,"" the newspaper  AL-THAWRAH says: He is mistaken who thinks that Syria would  accept less than the full restoration of the Golan, in addition  to occupied southern Lebanon. This is because full withdrawal  is the basis for a comprehensive peace, and he who is concerned  about a just and comprehensive peace must also be faithful to  the pillars and constants of peace which were approved at the  Madrid Conference.    The paper adds: Israel has imagined it can have peace and  occupation together. Sometimes it slandered Syria's stands, and  other times Lebanon's stands. It has always sought to entrap  this or that party in a separate deal, something which was  achieved in the labyrinths of Oslo which led to the Cairo  agreement that imposed Israeli trusteeship on the Palestinian  Arab people and their destinies.    The paper adds: Israel cannot present the agreement with the  Palestinian side as an example of partial solutions which it  seeks to achieve on the other tracks of negotiations, or use it  as a pretext to peddle such unilateral deals, and at the same  time exclude the bases of the peace process and the pillars  governing the Madrid conference, foremost of which is the  implementation of the UN Security Council resolutions and the  land-for-peace principle.    Proceeding from this important point, President Hafiz  al-Asad stressed, when he received U.S. Secretary of State  Christopher early this month, the need to tackle the major  issues of the peace process in order to guarantee making  progress. Also based on this, Presidents al-Asad and al-Hirawi  have called for adhering to the Madrid bases and for further  coordination among the Syrian, Lebanese, and Jordanian tracks.  This is in order to foil Israel's attempts to deal separately  with each Arab side and drag it into partial solutions that have  nothing to do with the Madrid bases and the essence of a just  and comprehensive peace, which is based on full withdrawal and  resolving all aspects of the conflict to guarantee the  establishment of a peace that would end all factors of tension  and chaos, and fulfills the international community's desire for  stability and security in the region.    Concluding, AL-THAWRAH says: Peace cannot be established  without an accurate implementation of the UN Security Council  resolutions which Israel seeks to bypass through secret deals  and partial solutions which entrench occupation and give Israel  peace and land together, something which is impossible.    Under the headline ""The Israeli Withdrawal,"" the newspaper  TISHRIN says: News agencies cited informed sources as saying  that the U.S. secretary of state's Middle East tour this time  will be confined to Syria and Israel, and that it is aimed at  giving the Syrian-Israeli track a push forward and at achieving  tangible progress on the road to a just and entrenched peace in  the region.    TISHRIN adds: It is known that Christopher held lengthy  talks in both occupied Jerusalem and Damascus during the  previous tour. It is no longer a secret that Syria adhered to  the principle of full and comprehensive withdrawal from the  Golan as a basic condition for peace. At the same time, Israel  gave first priority to its security, after which withdrawal will  follow or will be achieved in phases to test Syria's peace  intentions, as the Tel Aviv rulers say.    The paper adds: Talk about probing Syria's peace intentions  is a kind of deception and cover for the occupation and its  expansionist plans, taking into consideration that Syria has  always complied with the UN Security Council resolutions and the  UN Charter and principles. Moreover, Syria has never been  exposed to a single international denunciation. However, Israel  has been violating the UN Security Council resolutions since  1947 until now. It has also violated the principles and  charters of the international community. Based on this, Israel  is the one which must be put to the test, considering that it is  the aggressor and the occupier. Testing Israel's desire for  peace can be represented by its full withdrawal from the Golan  and all the occupied territories. The Knesset decision on the  annexation of the Golan will never change this.    The paper says: Syria has made several appeals to achieve a  just and comprehensive peace, the peace of the brave, and called  on Israel's rulers to be brave and to be up to this peace.  Until this moment, Syria has not seen any true Israeli  response. On the contrary, Israel's rulers adopted the policy  of procrastination, prevarication, and of evading the UN  Security Council resolutions. They have just made statements on  a certain withdrawal from the Golan. We want to reiterate that  Syria rejects any phased settlements or partial solutions. This  is because true peace hinges on the full restoration of the  Golan, the dismantling of all settlements, and the return of the  Syrian evacuees to their land and homes. Consequently, Israel's  withdrawal does not constitute a concession, for withdrawal is  dictated by the international law and the UN Security Council  resolutions.    Concluding, TISHRIN says: Peace in the Middle East depends  on Israel's compliance with the resolutions of international  legitimacy. Israel's withdrawal from the Golan and the occupied  territories paves the way for a firm and true peace. Without  this, talk about peace will be a waste of time.     "
0,FT931-986 ,"FT931-986 _AN-DCZBZAHZFT 930326   FT  26 MAR 93 / Prospects improve for Bosnian peace talks progress      By MICHAEL LITTLEJOHNS and ROBERT MAUTHNER      NEW YORK, LONDON   PROSPECTS for a breakthrough in the see-sawing Bosnian peace talks improved last night after the Moslem president of Bosnia, Mr Alija Izetbegovic, promised to sign a key part of the package drawn up by international mediators. The sudden improvement in the atmosphere of the talks, which only 24 hours earlier had seemed close to collapse, came as the situation on the ground in Bosnia took a turn for the worse. Mr Cedric Thornberry, deputy head of the United Nations Protection Force in the former Yugoslavia (Unprofor), told a news conference in Belgrade that the eastern Bosnian Moslem town of Srebrenica, which has been under siege for the past 11 months, could fall to the Bosnian Serbs within days. 'There are clear indications that the Bosnian Serb army has not just strategic, but territorial ambitions in the whole area,' Mr Thornberry said. The signal that serious progress at last appeared to have been made at the negotiations in New York, chaired by Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, was given by the announcement that a plenary session of the conference would be held later in the day. The meeting, later postponed for some hours to give Mr Izetbegovic time to consult his government colleagues in Sarajevo, would be the first face-to-face meeting between the leaders of the warring parties during the current round of talks. It followed several hours of intensive negotiations on Wednesday night between Mr Izetbegovic and Mr Mate Boban, the Bosnian Croat leader, who is the only one of the three protagonists to have signed all three parts of the proposed peace agreement. During their meeting, the Moslem and Croat leaders agreed a number of minor changes to the map of the 10 provinces into which Bosnia would be divided under the Vance-Owen proposals. They also agreed to amendments to a fourth document, the interim arrangements which will cover the period between the conclusion of a settlement and the holding of elections. Important as the Moslem and Croat acceptance of the peace plan would be, it would not be workable without the signature of Dr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, who has been held responsible by western governments for most of the atrocities committed in Bosnia. Yet the mediators had no illusions that Dr Karadzic, who was on the point of returning home earlier this week after they had chided him for his negative attitude, was any nearer to putting his name to an agreement. According to Lord Owen, his position was far removed from that of the other participants and he was still hoping to create an independent Bosnian Serb state, which could eventually merge with a greater Serbia. Mr Fred Eckhard, the conference spokesman, nevertheless described the latest developments in New York as 'a sudden turn for the better'.   Countries:-  BAZ  Bosnia-Hercegovina, East Europe.

The initiative is aimed at having an agreement  reached between the Republic of Croatia and the republic of Serb  Krajina (RSK) on the cessation of hostilities and the restoring  of peace.    Churkin and RSK President Milan Martic agreed in Belgrade on  Wednesday that Krajina-Croatia talks be held at the Russian  Embassy in Zagreb on March 22.    The conflict between Krajina and Croatia broke out in 1991  because of Croatia's forcible secession from the former  Yugoslavia and the attempt of its authorities to reduce the Serb  people to a national minority.    The RSK was proclaimed in 1991 on ethnically and  historically  Serb territories within the administrative borders of the former  Yugoslav republic of Croatia. The RSK was proclaimed a U.N.  protected area (UNPA) in March 1992.    After meeting with Martic, Churkin conferred separately with  Bosnian Serb Leader Radovan Karadzic and President Slobodan  Milosevic of Serbia and left for Zagreb in the afternoon.  Churkin is due to leave from Zagreb for Washington on Thursday  to meet with U.S. President's special envoy Charles Redman.    The new Russian initiative is in a way complementary with  the  U.S. initiative for the creation of a Moslem-Croat federation in  the former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina and its  subsequent confederation with Croatia.    The new Russian peace initiative indicates that Moscow has  arrived at the conclusion that no overall political settlement  is possible in Bosnia-Herzegovina without a solution for the  krajina-Croatia issue.    On the other hand, the United States considers the agreement  on a Moslem-Croat federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina to be of the  utmost importance at this point. However, the agreement has  completed only the first stage of the U.S. peace initiative.  The second stage, that is, the reaching of an overall  settlement for Bosnia- Herzegovina, will not be possible without  the Bosnian Serbs and Russia.    It remains to be seen how Washington intends to clear the  way  for the second stage of the peace initiative. It is aware that  the initiative cannot be successful without the Bosnian Serbs  and it is no doubt seriously counting on Russia to lend a  helping hand.    The announced Churkin-Redman talks should most likely be  viewed in that light, and it would be no surprise if the special  U.S. envoy was soon to visit Belgrade again.     "

In a statement to the weekly AL-MUSAWWAR to be published on  Friday [22 April], Rabin said President Mubarak helped greatly  to continue the process and remove the obstacles in its way.    On the negotiations with Syria, the Israeli prime minister  said he does not believe peace with Syria can be achieved  without secret meetings. He pointed out that Israel held talks  with the PLO in Oslo for six months and that that helped to  achieve the Declaration of Principles.    He added: Our government was the first in Israel to accept  Resolution 242 as a basis for peace with Syria, entailing  withdrawal on the Golan [min fawq al-julan]. But Rabin added  that the geographic scale of the withdrawal cannot be specified  before Israel knows exactly what the Syrians mean by full peace.    Asked about the failure to implement the Palestinian-Israeli  agreement and the reason for the postponement, Rabin said: We  have not postponed negotiations. We are ready to continue the  talks indefinitely to reach an agreement that would achieve the  goals of the transitional stage, overcome opposition by  particular forces on both sides, achieve security for the  Israelis, and grant the Palestinian council the authority to  administer the Palestinian people's affairs.    Asked about ways to solve the problem of settlements, Rabin  said that the agreement is very clear: It provides that all the  settlements will stay where they are during the transitional  stage. The PLO signed this agreement and we will discuss the  settlements issue when we negotiate over the final solution.    Asked about negotiations with Jordan and Lebanon, Rabin  said:  We believed that we were close to an agreement with Jordan but,  regrettably, our efforts did not succeed. We have virtually no  territorial problems with Jordan. He stressed that Israel has  no territorial problems with Lebanon but there is a security  problem because the Lebanese Government cannot muster  sovereignty over all its territory. We do not covet one inch of  Lebanese territory and all that we hope is that the Lebanese  Government can disengage the private military organizations.    On the possibility of holding a meeting between him and  Palestinian president Yasir 'Arafat, Rabin said: We must  prepare for such a meeting because if we meet and fail to sign  an agreement, our failure would cause disappointment and  frustration and defeat our purpose of reaching an agreement that  can be implemented.

""The departure of the foreign troops will have  salutary rather than adverse affects on the search for peace and  a negotiated political settlement,"" General Aidid told a press  conference here in the Kenyan capital. ""We are surprised about  the hysteria being drummed up in the media and in some other  quarters that the withdrawal of the U.S. troops will somehow  trigger off sudden explosions of fighting among Somali  factions,"" he said.    Some 3,000 troops currently remain in Somalia, the spearhead  of the UN force there, but Washington and other western  governments plan to pull out their soldiers by the end of March,  in a move that has sparked fears of renewed heavy fighting in  the Horn of Africa nation.    Aidid, the strongman in much of the capital Mogadishu and  southern Somalia since 1991, said the prospect for peace was  ""now much better than it was last year,"" and called for  continued UN relief assistance to his country, where conflict  caused widespread famine. ""One wonders if (the) doomsayers have  ever stopped to think what the U.S. troops have been doing in  Somalia since their arrival, or in what part of the country they  have been deployed, or whether they have ever separated warring  factions,"" Aidid said. [passage omitted]    Referring to weekend clashes in the southern port of  Kismaayo, where some 60 people reportedly died, Aidid said:  ""Kismaayo is on fire, despite a 'peace conference' last year  orchestrated, choreographed, staged, conducted and starred in by  UNOSOM (the UN Operation in Somalia)."" He added that he was  ready to meet one of his Somali rivals, General Mohamed Hersi,  known as Morgan, who is battling his allies for Kismaayo, if his  grass-roots supporters backed the mood. Peace prevailed where  no foreign soldiers were deployed, Aidid claimed.    ""We are aware of the concern by the donor countries about  the  security situation in the country and the level of the cost of  the aid programs,"" he added. ""We wish to assure the donor  countries, aid workers and all concerned that we will do  everything possible to improve the situation. We hope the donor  countries will continue to assist Somalia overcome its current  difficulties.""    He stressed that he was ""not adverse to the UNOSOM troops  protecting humanitarian aid as prescribed by the Security  Council Resolution 897. But there must be humanitarian aid to  protect."" [passage omitted]    Aidid said his Somali National Alliance had ""advised and  warned the UN against using the foreign troops as an occupation  force, against usurping the authority and functions of Somali  political leaders and against treating Somalia as if it were  under trusteeship.""    He had remained in Nairobi for almost three months, after  the  UN- sponsored peace conference which ended without agreement, to  pursue talks with other Somali clan leaders and members, adding  that while consultations were ""time-consuming"" they were not  leading nowhere. Aidid said he was leaving later Wednesday or  Thursday for Eritrea and talks with President Isayas Afewerki.     "

Mr Adams said last night that the 'various interpretations' of the declaration illustrated the need for 'full and frank' clarification of the key issues. Mr Major's 'present policy of addressing republicans through the columns of newspapers' was 'a childish nonsense and . . . grossly irresponsible', he said. Downing Street said it would study Mr Adams' letter - but officials pointed out that Mr Major has repeatedly ruled out any talks with Sinn Fein in advance of acceptance of the joint declaration. Mr Adams' statement overshadowed an increasingly heated war of words between politicians in the province over the failure of republican leaders to date to say definitively whether they will embrace the UK-Irish peace initiative. The row erupted after Mr James Molyneaux, the Ulster Unionist party leader, made it clear on Tuesday night that he thought the IRA had already in effect rejected the declaration. Mr Molyneaux's unexpectedly downbeat remarks were immediately criticised by Mr John Hume, leader of the mainly Roman Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party, and by Mr Adams. But in Dublin, Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, made a point of praising the statesmanship displayed by Mr Molyneaux while urging republican leaders to renounce their 25-year armed struggle. Speaking to the Irish Labour party's general council, Mr Spring appealed for patience but said: 'We must keep sending the message again and again that the causes - or excuses - behind the so-called armed struggle have ceased to have any relevance for anyone on this island.' Mr Spring said the armed struggle would 'never persuade, or achieve any form of willing consent'. Mr Adams yesterday referred to the British government's 'hypocrisy and cynicism' and claimed it was 'in reality seeking a public justification for a renewed onslaught on Irish nationalists'. He added: 'This is clearly the Unionist objective.' Mr Ken Maginnis, Ulster Unionist security spokesman, said: 'One is left to wonder whether this is just posturing by Mr Adams in line with what appears to be a pessimistic attitude emanating from the nationalist community.'

Shortly after his arrival, Mr  Nguyen Manh Cam held talks with Prince Norodom Sirivut, deputy  prime minister and minister for foreign affairs and  international cooperation of the Kingdom of Cambodia.    Present at the talks were, on the Vietnamese side,  Ambassador  to Cambodia Tran Huy Chuong and other senior officials of the  Foreign Ministry on the Cambodia side, senior officials of the  Ministry for Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation,  Ministry of Defence, Ministry of Interior and others.

Both sides discussed preparations for  Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet's forthcoming official  visit to Cambodia. They also touched on the regional and  international issues of common concern. Minister Nguyen Manh  Cam highly appreciated head of state Norodom Sihanouk's  important role in the cause of peace and national reconciliation  in Cambodia and expressed his hope that Cambodia will have  stability to build a country of peace, independence, neutrality  and non-alignment having friendly relations with other  countries, firstly neighbouring countries. He once again  affirmed Vietnam's determination to build and broaden the  friendly and multi-faceted cooperation between the two countries  on the principles stated in the joint communiques in January  1992 and in August 1993.    Mr. Sirivut hailed the great achievements recorded by the  Vietnamese people in their renovation cause and in the  implementation of the external policy of broadening and  diversifying relations and highly appreciated Vietnam's good  will and positive attitude toward the process of peace in  Cambodia. He also expressed the determination of the Cambodian  Government and people to foster the friendship and long-term  cooperation between the two countries. He stated that the coming  visit to the Kingdom of Cambodia by Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet  will be an important event ushering in a new stage in the  neighbourly relations between Vietnam and Cambodia.

They said there was no shred of  justification for continuing the killings in Ulster. Speaking  on the steps of Downing Street after a 90-minute discussion, the  two leaders warned they were not ""waiting around"" for Sinn Fein  to respond to last year's joint declaration.    Progress was being made on a framework document grounded in  the declaration and on talks with the constitutional parties --  and would proceed with or without Sinn Fein. Mr Major urged the  paramilitaries to end their campaign of violence.    He and Mr Reynolds shared ""a disappointment that the  violence  continues,"" both the IRA violence and the loyalist violence.  ""There is no shred of justification for it whatsoever.""    Mr Reynolds said: ""There is one message quite clear that we  want to give -- that is that neither paramilitary organisations  are going to gain anything or bolster their position by a  continuation of violence.

""There  is no delay, there has been no delay and there will be no delay  in continuing discussions with the constitutional parties and  with the government of the Republic of Ireland on the framework  document we are producing,"" said Mr Major. ""A great deal of  progress has been made. There's more to be done but it is not  awaiting an answer from Sinn Fein.""    Mr Reynolds said: ""The two governments are not going to wait  around, are not waiting around, for any more prevarication on  either side to stop the violence. We continue with our own  business.""    Mr Major was questioned by reporters about Sinn Fein  president Gerry Adams's earlier comments in which he offered  what was interpreted by some as new hope for peace in Northern  Ireland.    Mr Major said: ""I see nothing new in what he had to say this  morning. ""What was quite striking was what he didn't say. He  made no indication that he was going to give up violence.""    Mr Adams indicated there would be a Sinn Fein response to  the  peace moves after the European elections on June 9.    ""I am quite convinced that what is going to come out of this  peace process is a peace settlement -- I am quite convinced  about it. It is a significant step.""    He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""It is part of one of  those steps which are required to advance the peace process. It  addresses some of the core issues and it dismisses some of the  other questions.""    The fact that the British government responded to Sinn  Fein's  list of questions about the declaration was ""very significant"".    Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring told a European  conference  in Paris today: ""The time for clarification and debate is over.  It is now time, once and for all, to stop the killing from  whatever quarter on the island of Ireland.    ""The people of Ireland will wait no longer.""    Mr Reynolds said later he hoped Sinn Fein's response to the  declaration ""will be genuine and positive, and that it will lead  to a permanent cessation of violence.    ""That is the only logical next step if the peace process is  to be moved forward. I do not want to see anybody killed in the  meantime on either side.""    He added: ""What is important is that the violence by both  sets of paramilitaries in Northern Ireland should be ended  immediately.""    Mr Reynolds said at the Irish Embassy in London that moves  planned by the British and Irish governments to re-establish an  inter-party negotiating process in Northern Ireland were being  maintained.    He and Mr Major would have a full-scale summit on their  peace  initiative in mid-July.    Meanwhile, Liberal Democrat Ulster spokesman Lord Holme  said:  ""It is urgent that the British government table proposals for  constitutional progress in Northern Ireland based on devolution,  power-sharing and a Bill of Rights.    ""If Sinn Fein want to renounce violence and join the talks  process, all well and good, but the onus is on the British  government to take the initiative in consultation with the Irish  government and the constitutional parties of Northern Ireland.""

The trauma and anguish  caused by the progrom have made it extremely difficult for the  Arab side to continue the negotiations on business-as-usual  basis. A halt to the Washington talks was inevitable.    His Majesty King Husayn told members of Parliament Saturday  that a decision to withdraw from the negotiations was not up to  Jordan alone, but rather a collective Arab position that needed  to be carefully taken. Now that a solemn decision has been  taken, the PLO too can be expected to stick to its demands for  protection of Palestinians under occupation before talks can be  resumed in any manner or form.    Judging by the deliberations of the U.N. Security Council on  a draft resolution on the Hebron massacre, the likelihood of an  agreement among the permanent members for the establishment of  an international regime for the protection of Palestinians looks  dim. With the council's inability to move effectively in that  direction due to opposition from Washington and London in  particular, the chances of the PLO acepting without any question  U.S. President Bill Clinton's invitation to both sides to take  part in a continuous session in Washington till a breakthrough  is attained look also bleak.    France's alternative proposal to place international  observers in the West Bank and Gaza Strip to monitor the  situation there may offer a middle ground that could be  acceptable to both sides. Such an initiative could be a nucleus  for greater international role in the occupied territories and  deserves careful consideration. If accepted, the idea could be  a modest beginning of a process that may prove unstoppable.    Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has yet to address the  French proposal and most probably he would reject it. PLO  chairman Yasir 'Arafat, on the other hand, saw some merits in it  and did not rule it out of hand.    The worthiness of the French idea lies in the fact that the  other permanent members of the Security Council could find it  workable under the circumstances. Besides, the Arab side is not  exactly in a mood, politically or emotionally, to resume peace  efforts as if nothing had happened. Something meaningful has to  be adopted therefore as an effetive antidote to the massacre  before Arab- Israeli negotiations can be put on track again.     "

Speaking on Irish radio, the Rev Martin Smyth, Ulster Unionist MP for South Belfast, said that if Sinn Fein delivered a genuine cessation of violence in Northern Ireland the Ulster Unionists would give Sinn Fein 'the recognition that they are a bona fide political party and have a right to take part in a political process, representing those who vote for them . . . It is not a question of saying we'll give you this or give you that, that is a matter for discussion when they come (to the negotiating table)'. He also said in an earlier interview with the BBC that Sinn Fein should recognise unionist rights to be part of the UK. Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, described Mr Smyth's comments as 'positive and constructive' and added: 'It has always been my view that a cessation of violence would radically transform the situation.' The Irish government continues to guard its silence however regarding the content of the peace initiative launched two weeks ago by Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein leader, and Mr John Hume, the leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party. After receiving a briefing on the initiative last week from Mr John Hume, Mr Reynolds said the initiative would be evaluated by the Irish cabinet next Tuesday. After yesterday's cabinet meeting however, the Dublin government said only that 'evaluation is ongoing' and gave no indication whether any proposals are about to made to the British government. The Hume-Adams initiative appears to be driving a wedge into Unionist ranks, with the Democratic Unionist party reacting angrily to the latest UUP position. Mr Peter Robinson, deputy leader of the DUP said: 'Since Sunningdale (the 1973 conference which established an ill-fated power sharing executive without the DUP), no deeper wound has been inflicted upon unionism than this.' He said the UUP position was 'an act of monumental folly'.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.     IEZ  Ireland, EC.   Industries:-  P8651 Political Organizations.

""However,"" Churkin noted, ""it is not our intention to bring  about a crisis over this issue in the relations between Russia  and the international community.""

The talks were attended by Milan Martic, president  of the republic of Serbian Krajina, and Borislav Mikelic, prime  minister of the republic of Serbian Krajina. Churkin also met  delegations of the republic of Serbian Krajina and the republic  of Srpska today. Here is a report by Snezana Rodic on how  today's talks were held and how they were assessed:    [Rodic] How would you briefly assess the second round of  talks with President Milosevic?    [Churkin] We were summarizing the overall talks we held  today and I think that the Serbian side is serious and that it  is seriously going to attend the Geneva meeting with a view to  agreeing on the cessation of hostilities. They are preparing  themselves for the second round of negotiations with the contact  group. This will take place soon. I think that all this was  worthwhile. We in Moscow are planning a very busy month of June  as regards the matters that will have to be done urgently.    [Rodic] Did you talk about sanctions with President  Milosevic?    [Churkin] If I had not mentioned them, he would have  mentioned them to me. This issue is usually mentioned at our  talks.    [Rodic] (?Would) you say something more about that?    [Churkin] We have this position that I think is a very good  one. It is included in the ministerial communique. Therefore, a  solution to the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina will lead to the  suspension of sanctions. I think that this is an encouragement  to the Serbian side to reach a solution.    [Rodic] In the Russian Embassy in Belgrade, Vitaliy Churkin  first met a delegation of the Republic of Serbian Krajina which  included Milan Martic and Borislav Mikelic. They discussed the  continuation of negotiations with Croatia. It was pointed out  that the Republic of Serbian Krajina is an equal partner and  that it has respected the peace agreement on cease-fire,  something which was also confirmed by UNPROFOR [UN Protection  Forces]. The main problem is where the peace negotiations are  to be held.    [Martic] Our stand is that this should be a neutral venue,  outside the territory of either Croatia or Krajina, although  Croatia insisted that the venue be exclusively in Croatia or  Krajina, thereby prejudging the political solution that Krajina  is within Croatia and wanting somehow to reduce this to its  internal problem. We are still insisting that this should be a  neutral place. It can be a Russian embassy in any foreign  country. However, we still remain open for negotiations, but of  course should hold consultations within our ranks, that is, in  the parliament and the government.    [Rodic] Churkin then had talks with a delegation of the  Serbian Republic, Dr. Nikola Koljevic and Momcilo Krajisnik.  This was a consultative talk on the eve of the Geneva  negotiations that have been convened by Yasushi Akashi. The  Serbian side pointed out that a new Croatian-Muslim federation  must not turn into an anti-Serb coalition.    [Krajisnik] (?I) informed Mr. Churkin that our negotiating  team will go to the meeting to conclude an agreement on the  cessation of hostilities and that we are going to take part in  the next meeting of the contact group.    We have also discussed certain (?disputable) issues. Maps  are always (?disputable) issues. There has been no special  progress. Muslim proposals presented to us are already known.  This is east Bosnia, western Bosnia, they are all questions  demanding great attention and effort in order to reach the final  solution.    [Koljevic in English with superimposed translation into  Serbo-Croatian] We think that the cessation of hostilities is  by far the most important thing. We are prepared to discuss  territories. We do not think that percentages are a good  approach to the beginning, but we are ready to discuss  territories, albeit with arguments about the maps -- quality,  infrastructure, communications are much more important things  than percentages.    [Churkin] I am encouraged that my talks with Mr. Martic were  very useful. I think that everything is moving forward, toward  the beginning of the talks about economic matters, so I expect  that before too long we shall find a way to begin these talks  about economic normalization between Knin and Zagreb, that is,  about the second stage of their difficult road toward a  normalization of relations. I also had useful talks with Mr.  Krajisnik and Mr. Koljevic.    [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. Koljevic told us half an  hour ago that one should talk about the quality of territories.  Would one have to redefine the 49-51 percent relation?    [Churkin] No, that will stay. They have to talk about these  details within the framework of the concept approved by foreign  ministers of the key countries. This was not a frivolous  decision, but one based on the months of very long discussions  and talks between all sides. They will have to stick to that  concept.     "

By JAMES GERSTENZANG, TIMES STAFF WRITER      HUNTSVILLE, Ala.      President Bush on Wednesday suspended the 18-month-old U.S. dialogue with the  Palestine Liberation Organization in response to the foiled Palestinian  guerrilla landing on an Israeli beach last month.    ""We've given the PLO ample time to deal with this issue. To date, the PLO has  not provided a credible accounting,"" Bush said at a news conference.    White House officials said that Bush is prepared to resume the talks with the  PLO once the organization denounces the raid -- which a PLO faction known as  the Palestine Liberation Front claimed to have carried out -- and disciplines  the splinter group.    The low-key dialogue with the Palestine Liberation Organization began in  December, 1988, when U.S. Ambassador Robert H. Pelletreau Jr. met with a PLO  representative in Tunis.    The path for that meeting was cleared when Yasser Arafat, the PLO chairman,  acknowledged Is rael's right to exist and renounced the use of terrorism. Until  he took those steps, U.S. policy forbade official contact with representatives  of the key organization representing Palestinians in the Middle East.    But ever since the terrorist raid on a beach near Tel Aviv on May 30, Bush has  been under increasing pressure from Congress, Israel and Israel's supporters to  suspend the talks. Israeli forces intercepted the guerrillas on land and in the  speedboats they used to approach the shore. Four guerrillas were killed and 12  captured.    ""The size of the force and the geographical target area strongly indicate that  civilians would have been the target,"" Bush said.    A spokesman for the Palestine Liberation Front, claiming responsibility for the  raid shortly after it occurred, said that it was intended to ""avenge"" the  killings of seven Palestinian day laborers in the town of Rishon Le Zion, south  of Tel Aviv, by an Israeli gunman May 20.    The front is led by Mohammed Abbas, also known as Abul Abbas, a member of the  PLO Executive Committee. His organization is one of the more radical wings  under the PLO umbrella and also one of the smallest. In 1985, it planned and  executed the hijacking of the Italian cruise liner Achille Lauro, during which  an American passenger, Leon Klinghoffer, was killed.    Despite the pressure on Bush, Administration officials had clearly sought to  avoid the rupture out of concern that it would cut off what had been seen as a  useful -- if not overtly productive -- contact with some of the most important  players in the Middle East.    Pelletreau, the U.S. envoy to Tunisia, had met at least six times in ""intense  discussions"" with PLO representatives since the raid, and Bush held off  suspending the talks ""to give them time to do what we want: denounce the act  and discipline the guy who did it,"" said a White House official, speaking on  condition of anonymity.    According to the White House official, the PLO said that it was unable to  ""dictate"" to each of its member factions and that it, too, had to pay heed to  ""domestic pressure"" from among its constituent groups and Arab supporters.    But when the delay in action failed to produce the desired results, the  Administration believed that it had no options left and it sent word to the  Palestinians and Israel early Wednesday morning that it was about to act.    On Capitol Hill, the leaders of both parties were quick to praise Bush's  decision to suspend the dialogue with the PLO.    ""The President had no choice but to suspend the dialogue,"" said California Rep.  Mel Levine (D-Santa Monica), a member of the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee  on Europe and the Middle East. ""When the United States blinks at terrorism, it  just encourages those who engage in terrorism.""    Rep. Larry Smith (D-Fla.), one of the most anti-PLO legislators on Capitol  Hill, said he will push for passage of a bill that would prevent the President  from resuming the dialogue unless both the PLO and all of its constituent  factions renounce terrorism and publicly recognize Israel's right to exist.    Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole of Kansas, who in recent months has emerged as  one of the Senate's sternest critics of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's  government, said: ""The ball is in the PLO's court. It must unequivocally  condemn the recent terrorist attack. It must discipline those responsible,  starting with Abul Abbas.""    Secretary of State James A. Baker III, on his way to East Berlin for German  reunification talks, said that suspension of the U.S.-PLO dialogue could be a  setback for the Arab-Israeli peace process.    Baker said the PLO, as a result of its contacts with Washington, had given  tacit approval to peace talks between Israel and a delegation of Palestinians  from the West Bank and Gaza Strip.    He said ""it remains to be seen"" whether the PLO will withdraw its approval as a  result of Bush's decision to terminate the dialogue.    In private, U.S. officials said they hope the rupture will not last long.    ""We don't want this to be a protracted suspension. We hope it is a temporary  move,"" a State Department official said. ""The shorter the better for the Middle  East peace process and all parties concerned.""    Speaking to reporters during a day that included a visit to the George C.  Marshall Space Flight Center, and two speeches at political fund-raising events  here and in Charlotte, N.C., Bush said:    ""I have decided to suspend the dialogue between the United States and the PLO,  pending a satisfactory response from the PLO of steps it is taking to resolve  problems associated with the recent acts of terrorism.""    He acknowledged that the PLO, an umbrella group made up of often-warring  factions, has disassociated itself from the attack and has condemned attacks  against civilians.    ""This alone is not sufficient,"" the President said.    He added that ""we are prepared to promptly resume the dialogue"" once the  Palestinian organization takes ""the necessary steps"" -- meaning once the PLO  denounces the raid and disciplines Abbas.    The move comes at a particularly bleak period in the effort to revive the  stalled Middle East peace process.    Shamir's new Israeli government has taken a hard line against talks with  Palestinian representatives and has vowed to press ahead with the establishment  of new settlements in the occupied territories.    But a week after Baker expressed irritation with the delays in the peace  process -- an irritation that was taken as a slap at Israel -- Bush's move  serves to restore a measure of public balance. When the action Wednesday is  linked with Baker's remarks a week ago, the Administration, in effect, has  demonstrated dissatisfaction with both sides.    Even though specific gains from the talks in Tunis were difficult to enumerate,  Bush said the mere fact that a dialogue about Middle East politics and security  was taking place represented progress.    Times staff writers Robin Wright and Michael Ross, in Washington, and Norman  Kempster, with Baker, contributed to this report.

The path for that meeting was cleared when Yasser Arafat, the PLO chairman,  acknowledged Is rael's right to exist and renounced the use of terrorism. Until  he took those steps, U.S. policy forbade official contact with representatives  of the key organization representing Palestinians in the Middle East.    But ever since the terrorist raid on a beach near Tel Aviv on May 30, Bush has  been under increasing pressure from Congress, Israel and Israel's supporters to  suspend the talks. Israeli forces intercepted the guerrillas on land and in the  speedboats they used to approach the shore. Four guerrillas were killed and 12  captured.    ""The size of the force and the geographical target area strongly indicate that  civilians would have been the target,"" Bush said.    A spokesman for the Palestine Liberation Front, claiming responsibility for the  raid shortly after it occurred, said that it was intended to ""avenge"" the  killings of seven Palestinian day laborers in the town of Rishon Le Zion, south  of Tel Aviv, by an Israeli gunman May 20.    The front is led by Mohammed Abbas, also known as Abul Abbas, a member of the  PLO Executive Committee. His organization is one of the more radical wings  under the PLO umbrella and also one of the smallest. In 1985, it planned and  executed the hijacking of the Italian cruise liner Achille Lauro, during which  an American passenger, Leon Klinghoffer, was killed.    Despite the pressure on Bush, Administration officials had clearly sought to  avoid the rupture out of concern that it would cut off what had been seen as a  useful -- if not overtly productive -- contact with some of the most important  players in the Middle East.    Pelletreau, the U.S. envoy to Tunisia, had met at least six times in ""intense  discussions"" with PLO representatives since the raid, and Bush held off  suspending the talks ""to give them time to do what we want: denounce the act  and discipline the guy who did it,"" said a White House official, speaking on  condition of anonymity.    According to the White House official, the PLO said that it was unable to  ""dictate"" to each of its member factions and that it, too, had to pay heed to  ""domestic pressure"" from among its constituent groups and Arab supporters.    But when the delay in action failed to produce the desired results, the  Administration believed that it had no options left and it sent word to the  Palestinians and Israel early Wednesday morning that it was about to act.    On Capitol Hill, the leaders of both parties were quick to praise Bush's  decision to suspend the dialogue with the PLO.    ""The President had no choice but to suspend the dialogue,"" said California Rep.  Mel Levine (D-Santa Monica), a member of the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee  on Europe and the Middle East. ""When the United States blinks at terrorism, it  just encourages those who engage in terrorism.""    Rep. Larry Smith (D-Fla.), one of the most anti-PLO legislators on Capitol  Hill, said he will push for passage of a bill that would prevent the President  from resuming the dialogue unless both the PLO and all of its constituent  factions renounce terrorism and publicly recognize Israel's right to exist.    Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole of Kansas, who in recent months has emerged as  one of the Senate's sternest critics of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's  government, said: ""The ball is in the PLO's court. It must unequivocally  condemn the recent terrorist attack. It must discipline those responsible,  starting with Abul Abbas.""    Secretary of State James A. Baker III, on his way to East Berlin for German  reunification talks, said that suspension of the U.S.-PLO dialogue could be a  setback for the Arab-Israeli peace process.    Baker said the PLO, as a result of its contacts with Washington, had given  tacit approval to peace talks between Israel and a delegation of Palestinians  from the West Bank and Gaza Strip.    He said ""it remains to be seen"" whether the PLO will withdraw its approval as a  result of Bush's decision to terminate the dialogue.    In private, U.S. officials said they hope the rupture will not last long.    ""We don't want this to be a protracted suspension. We hope it is a temporary  move,"" a State Department official said. ""The shorter the better for the Middle  East peace process and all parties concerned.""    Speaking to reporters during a day that included a visit to the George C.  Marshall Space Flight Center, and two speeches at political fund-raising events  here and in Charlotte, N.C., Bush said:    ""I have decided to suspend the dialogue between the United States and the PLO,  pending a satisfactory response from the PLO of steps it is taking to resolve  problems associated with the recent acts of terrorism.""    He acknowledged that the PLO, an umbrella group made up of often-warring  factions, has disassociated itself from the attack and has condemned attacks  against civilians.    ""This alone is not sufficient,"" the President said.    He added that ""we are prepared to promptly resume the dialogue"" once the  Palestinian organization takes ""the necessary steps"" -- meaning once the PLO  denounces the raid and disciplines Abbas.    The move comes at a particularly bleak period in the effort to revive the  stalled Middle East peace process.    Shamir's new Israeli government has taken a hard line against talks with  Palestinian representatives and has vowed to press ahead with the establishment  of new settlements in the occupied territories.    But a week after Baker expressed irritation with the delays in the peace  process -- an irritation that was taken as a slap at Israel -- Bush's move  serves to restore a measure of public balance. When the action Wednesday is  linked with Baker's remarks a week ago, the Administration, in effect, has  demonstrated dissatisfaction with both sides.    Even though specific gains from the talks in Tunis were difficult to enumerate,  Bush said the mere fact that a dialogue about Middle East politics and security  was taking place represented progress.    Times staff writers Robin Wright and Michael Ross, in Washington, and Norman  Kempster, with Baker, contributed to this report.

Nor does it hesitate to claim that the Arab  party is responsible for halting this progress. It does not  conceal that it wants complete Arab recognition, an end to the  Arab boycott, open borders, established diplomatic and economic  ties, and so forth, without its officials uttering the words  ""complete withdrawal,"" which they have all failed to say so far.    Here, we can see the large gap separating Israel's proposals  and the principles and foundations of the peace process,  particularly the UN resolutions on whose basis the regional  peace process started. The Israeli leaders are apparently still  gambling on drawing Syria into bargaining over land and rights,  despite the conviction that it is impossible to make peace with  Syria without returning the entire Syrian Golan Heights, without  Israel's withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories, and  without establishing just and comprehensive peace in an area  that will not see stability or tranquility without a just  solution and a comprehensive peace.    As long as the Israelis insist on marketing their own  concept  of peace, their own excuses for keeping land, and their own  incomplete view of peace in the region -- a view based on  individual solutions and unilateral deals -- it is only natural  that the climate of disappointment persists.    Political observers in the Arab and international arenas  realize that Israel is responsible for these disappointments and  for the failure of international efforts so far to achieve any  results. They realize Israel is responsible for the failure to  resume the bilateral talks, and, consequently, for not achieving  any progress worth mentioning in the entire peace process.    Therefore, the whole world now realizes, more than at any  time before, what direction has to be followed, and where  pressure should be applied to activate the peace process and  save what is left of it in a responsible and serious way.    We do not think anyone in this world wants Arabs to  relinquish their rights and their land, or to abandon the most  basic principles on which the peace process was based. This  would not achieve peace. Even if it was achieved superficially  in one aspect, it would not survive. In this case, it would be  an empty peace, lacking the most basic principles of continuity.    Establishing peace and seizing the opportunities available  today to achieve it require, before anything else, a commitment  to implementing the UN resolutions in letter and spirit, and  complete withdrawal to the borders that existed before the  aggression of June 1967. Only then will the statement on  goodwill, which the Israelis keep bragging about, come forth.  The occupied territories are Arab and the usurped rights are  Arab, not the opposite.     "

The leaders of the three main ethnic groups in Bosnia met for unscheduled talks which included Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, his Croatian counterpart Mr Franjo Tudjman and President Momir Bulatovic of Montenegro, which with Serbia forms the rump Yugoslav state. The talks came as international mediators Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg tried to persuade Mr Izetbegovic to drop his demand that a future Bosnia be based on centralised federation. Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader and Mr Mate Boban, his Bosnian Croat counterpart, have called for the creation of a loose confederation, which Mr Izetbegovic says will lead to more war and the possible annexation of large parts of Bosnia to Serbia and Croatia. The two peace envoys reportedly told Mr Izetbegovic that a newly created mainly Moslem state would receive economic aid from Moslem countries as well as the US. Mr Reginald Bartholomew, the special envoy of US president Bill Clinton who so far has maintained a distance from the peace talks, yesterday met Mr Izetbegovic for private talks. The mediators have pledged, in the event of the republic's ethnic division, that the mainly Moslem state would be granted at least 30 per cent of Bosnian territory and access to ports on the Adriatic Sea and the northern River Sava. They appear convinced, despite the upsurge in fighting in Bosnia, that Serb and Croat leaders would be willing to make territorial concessions to the Moslems. Serb forces control about 70 per cent of Bosnian territory and the Croats about 20 per cent. Mr Izetbegovic is likely to be sceptical that the international community will provide muscle to back the security of a Bosnian state. But Mr Mustafa Bijedic, chief of Bosnia's UN mission in Geneva, yesterday said: 'We were encouraged by the signs of support expressed by the co-chairmen.' Michael Littlejohns at the UN, New York, adds: French United Nations troops yesterday came under fire in Sarajevo for the second time in two days when shells hit a television building where they were setting up a communications base. Following the first artillery bombardment on French soldiers, on Sunday, UN commanders blamed the Bosnian Serbs and threatened to retaliate if peacekeeping forces came under attack again. The attack prompted Nato to signal it was moving closer to military intervention, saying it expected to provide air cover over Bosnia 'sooner rather than later'. Nato had assembled 60 combat aircraft at bases in Italy but Britain, France and the Netherlands had failed to place in Bosnia the forward air controllers needed to guide them, a United Nations official said.

The 16-year licences cover 28 of the 128 blocks in the Slyne and Erris Troughs lying some 70km off the west and north-west Ireland, and represent the first major offshore exploration effort in the Republic since the early 1980s. The licence terms require some 5,000km of seismic and other geophysical testing to be carried out, followed by the drilling of exploration wells. Eleven of the 28 blocks have been licenced to a consortium headed by Statoil (UK), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company. In announcing the licence awards this week, Mr Noel Treacy the Irish energy minister, said the response to the round had been 'very encouraging and vindicates our recent efforts to promote offshore exploration, particularly the 1992 licensing terms and taxation measures'. These measures include a concessionary corporation tax rate of 25 per cent for companies producing oil and gas under licence. The Slyne and Erris Troughs lie in water depths ranging from 200m to over 1,000m, and is a relatively unexplored area, having had only three exploratory wells drilled to date, although seismic surveys carried out in 1991 and 1992 suggested a 'significant potential' for both oil and gas. The current licensing round, covering 178 blocks in the Porcupine Basin off the west of Ireland, closes in December this year. Existing gas reserves in Ireland, at the shallower Kinsale and Ballycotton fields, are expected to be exhausted shortly after the year 2,000.   Countries:-  IEZ  Ireland, EC.

Serbia withdrew from talks in Zagreb, the Croatian capital, on the re-establishment of economic relations and transport, and the return of Croatian refugees to United Nations protected zones in Serb-held areas of Croatia. A Serbian government statement accused the Yugoslav government, under Prime Minister Milan Panic, of betraying Croatia's Serb minority by negotiating with Croatia. However, the federal government last night criticised the Serbian administration, saying 'only negotiations, and not cannons, will bring back dignity and freedom to the Serbs outside Serbia'. In an apparent reference to Mr Milosevic, it said: 'The people who brought us to a desperate position before the international community have no moral right to undermine moves towards peace by the Yugoslav government and president.' The conflict between Mr Milosevic, on one side, and Mr Panic and Mr Dobrica Cosic, the Yugoslav president, is set to sharpen further after last Sunday's referendum failed to win a vote in favour of early elections. Unofficial results yesterday showed the vote to be less than the required 50 per cent majority. Hopes for the demilitarisation of Sarajevo also foundered yesterday when Bosnian leaders pulled out of UN-sponsored talks. They accused Bosnian Serbs of stopping the repair of water and power in the Bosnian capital, which has been besieged for six months by Serb fighters. In northern Bosnia, Serb commanders said they had re-opened the land corridor for traffic between Serbia and Bosnia's Serb-held territories amid heavy fighting. However, in a conflicting report, Croatian radio claimed Croat forces had blocked the corridor west of Brcko, in north-eastern Bosnia. Reuter adds from London: Three European officials investigating atrocities against civilians in former Yugoslavia said Serbs seemed mainly to blame and thought there were legal grounds for prosecution. A draft report by officials appointed on British initiative under the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, recommended a committee of experts should work out a treaty creating a war crimes tribunal.

After talks in Bangkok with Mr Khieu Samphan, nominal Khmer Rouge leader, Mr Prasong Soonsiri, the Thai foreign minister, said he saw no change in the group's position. In the face of international criticism of its support for the Khmer Rouge, Thailand has announced plans to implement UN resolutions by stopping oil exports to the guerrillas and preventing the import of logs from Cambodia. Bangkok wants to be seen persuading the Khmer Rouge to abide by the Paris peace accords, which the organisation signed last year but has since repeatedly flouted. After yesterday's meeting, however, Mr Khieu reiterated Khmer Rouge allegations that Vietnamese forces were still active inside Cambodia and repeated demands that the Supreme National Council - which comprises the four main factions, including the Khmer Rouge - should be given more power. He also ruled out UN checkpoints inside Khmer Rouge territory to monitor sanctions against the group. The UN has no evidence to support Khmer Rouge accusations that Vietnamese forces remain in Cambodia in contravention of the peace accords. But to Thailand's embarrassment there have been reports of Thai soldiers - other than those serving with the UN - inside Khmer Rouge-controlled Cambodian territory.

It has been  made painfully clear that the relationship between the 40  million or so Irish Americans and Dublin is more durable than  the one between the White House and Downing Street.    It would be a great shame if the pique of the Prime  Minister,  John Major, or some of the collateral fall-out from the visit of  Mr Adams to the U.S., distracted from pursuit of the peace  process set out on December 15.    There is a tendency among British and Unionist politicians  to  throw up their hands in horror at the idea of the Sinn Fein  leader being given carte blanche to present himself as a person  of peace. However, this grossly underestimates the wisdom of all  those who watched his show in action.    His constant resort to attacks on the perceived colonial  power, Britain, and events that took place more than 70 years  ago, tends to be as unconvincing as Colonel al-Qadhdhafi's  attempt to blame all the world's ills on American imperialism.  It is the defence of someone who does not have the intellectual  fire power to justify violence, even on contemporary grounds.    The other benefits of Mr Adams' visit, are, first, the  acknowledgement by President Clinton that the December 15  declaration was the best way forward. Having the world's only  superpower behind the process can be helpful, as the  Israeli-Palestinian deal proves.    Second, as high level officials in Dublin point out, it puts  pressure on Mr Adams and the IRA to deliver on a ceasefire.  When he arrived at Dublin airport early yesterday he described  moves towards peace as being their ""final phase,"" a timely break  in his recent meanderings on the need for clarifications.    In fact, it is something of a distraction that Sir Patrick  Mayhew should have chosen now, just as the impact of Mr Adams's  visit is being absorbed in Ireland, to have changed horses by  refettling the existing political process. His ideas, including  a measure of power devolution to a new assembly and cross-border  co-operation in tourism and environment, are fine, and maybe  even sensible.    But the timing is appalling. It gives the appearance of a  domestically driven, political reaction to Mr Adams's megaphone  in New York. It does seem that Sir Patrick has again played  what is perceived in Dublin as his weakest suit: the failure to  consult with those directly concerned in the Nationalist and  Loyalist communities.    Senior ministers in Dublin believe that the Downing Street  declaration faces its stiffest test in the next few weeks. Once  the European election campaign moves into high gear in the  spring (polling is in July) politicians on both sides of the  border -- but particularly the Unionists in the North -- will be  so trapped by the need to show the respective power of their  factions, that the boldness which brought James Molyneaux to  Dublin will be snuffed out.    The government of the Republic has made an unusual effort  to cultivate Unionist support for the Downing Street declaration  with the Tanaiste [deputy prime minister] and foreign minister,  Dick Spring, travelling to Belfast and the Shankill as part of  the effort to demonstrate that politicians in the South do not  have horns. Indeed, there is a view here that Sir Patrick  should have spent as much time closely cultivating Unionist and  Nationalist factions, instead of pronouncing from Stormont in  the manner of the old-style British ruler.    What essentially has been going on since December 15 is  waiting on the IRA. It was clear from day one that, despite the  prelude of the Hume-Adams talks (and the accord which may never  even have been put down on paper) and the disclosure of the  unofficial contacts between Britain and Sinn Fein, that the IRA  was nowhere near ready to accept the concept of a ceasefire let  alone laying down its arms.    What has followed has been a kind of double bluff. Mr Adams  has waffled on ad nauseam about the need for clarification of  the Downing Street declaration. Albert Reynolds and the Dublin  government and Downing Street (to a lesser extent) have obliged  by delivering a series of speeches and statements looking across  a range of issues-including demilitarisation.    However, the real clarification that Mr Adams has been  seeking, according to high level offficials here, is not from  the main parties to the declaration (their positions are  basciaUy known) but from within the IRA itself. Adams is seen  as in the centre of a ""poisonous"" power struggle. He is  representative of a better educated generation which believes  that the armed struggle can never be won and that it is time to  modernise the IRA cause and move away from the hardline  republicanism, hatred and mythology of past generations.    But Mr Adams's ability to bring the moderates along, let  alone the extremists, is a high-wire act, and it is by no means  clear whether he will cross to the other side. It must be  remembered that the IRA has a strong vested interest in  maintaining an armed struggle that has brought them a large flow  of informal funds from the Eastern seaboard of the U.S. and  created a black economy built on racketeering.    Moreover, nobody -- including Mr Adams -- knows what the  reaction will be in the cells of South Armagh, the greatest  stronghold of republicanism. If Mr Adams pushes too far he  could find himself with a bullet in the neck, unleashing  internecine warfare within the extremist nationalist movement.    There is no great optimism in Dublin government circles of  the Downing Street declaration advancing. It believes it could  fail for a number of reasons: the exposure of Mr Adams, failure  of the British Government to maintain its secret track of  dialogue, the weakness of John Major which leaves him vulnerable  to the pressure of the more extreme Loyalists.    Sir Patrick's mid-course correction smacks of that. Despite  all of this there is a conviction here that the gains in  economic co-operation and standards of living which would follow  rapprochement are far too important to be lost. Failure now  would mean another two decades of armed stalemate and lost  economic opportunities.     "

0,FT923-1911 ,"FT923-1911 _AN-CIUDDABAFT 920921   FT  21 SEP 92 / Survey of Northern Ireland (1): Waving the olive branch - Present talks represent the first real hope of peace in years. But deepening recession and threat of spending cuts add to the sense of urgency      By TIM COONE   POLITICAL initiatives lie like burnt-out wrecks along the trail that has marked Northern Ireland's recent history. Twenty-three years of intractable sectarian conflict has left behind such a backlog of mistrust and fear that new ideas for bridging the gulf between the nationalist and unionist traditions in Northern Ireland have often been rejected out of hand before they have even had a hearing. But in April, for the first time since the 'troubles' began, the province's four main constitutional parties started facing each other at the negotiating table, with representatives from the British and Irish governments, to discuss substantive proposals for the future administrative structure for Northern Ireland. The complex three-strand negotiating process initiated then has created the first real hope in years that the elusive political settlement may finally be in the offing. The walk-out by the Democratic Unionist leaders at Stormont two weeks ago, however, has put a question mark over their likely presence in Dublin this week, where the talks are scheduled to resume today. The Rev Ian Paisley, the DUP leader, insists that the Irish government must first commit itself to reforming the Republic's constitution, dropping its legal territorial claim to Northern Ireland, before any progress can be made in other aspects of the negotiations. The Irish government, for its part, is proffering the carrot of constitutional reform to the Unionists, which would dilute the Republic's territorial claim to one of a mere 'aspiration' for Irish unity, but in return also wants guarantees that will protect the interests of the minority community in Northern Ireland. The nationalist Social Democratic Labour Party (SDLP) led by Mr John Hume, will be particularly anxious that any compromise on the Irish constitution must be compensated by a radical new government structure for the province, which will give Dublin some monitoring role in order to guard against any irredentism on the part of the Unionist majority. To date, the unionists have given few clues as to how they see the concerns of the nationalist community and the Irish government being addressed, or indeed that they are prepared to surrender any of their bargaining counters. That presumably will be tested soon. Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary of state, said that he has no wish to endanger the talks by putting undue pressure on the participants. 'I expect it to be a longer rather than a shorter process. It would be better to see a result rather than an abrupt halt. It will have a better chance of success if we allow people to sound off,' he said. However, there is concern in Dublin that the talks should not drag on indefinitely. Four cabinet ministers are in the Irish delegation, and are devoting most of their time to the talks - an indication of the importance Dublin attaches to the process. If no progress is made in the coming weeks, however, there could be a change of attitude, especially if simmering domestic crises should come to the boil. For its part, the UK government is showing signs of financial, if not political, fatigue with the Ulster question. In a speech earlier this month Mr Michael Mates, minister of state for finance and security in the province, said Northern Ireland would no longer be cushioned from the impact of spending cuts elsewhere in the country. 'There are firm constraints on public expenditure nationally and these are likely to be reflected in difficult decisions for all parts of the public sector. . . we in Northern Ireland cannot be excused our share of this misery'. It is an ominous warning. Some 40 per cent of employment in Northern Ireland comes from the public sector. It has been an important factor in Northern Ireland weathering the recession better than other parts of the country. Unemployment, already the highest regional rate in the UK, is rising, however, and independently forecast to exceed 16 per cent by 1994, even before any cuts. Economic experts are calling for radical new approaches to the economy. The government, however, appears to be going in the opposite direction. It is also going against the political grain in the province by pressing ahead with its plans for privatisation of public utilities against both nationalist and unionist opposition. The determination of the government to reduce Northern Ireland's strain on the Exchequer will undoubtedly encourage a growing number of politicians from both political persuasions to seek economic comfort in Brussels. Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, in its last Congress also noted that an EC dimension might form the basis of a political solution. Its leaders have also been making increasingly conciliatory statements towards the unionists in recent months. The defeat of Mr Gerry Adams in the West Belfast constituency at the last general elections is indicative that Sinn Fein's star is on the wane, and is pushing the organisation towards a more moderate and conciliatory stance. From the other end of the spectrum, Sir Patrick Mayhew is emphatic when he says: 'The British government does not have a selfish motive for staying here. It does not have a special interest of its own to serve . . . The more people understand that is the way we look at it, the harder it will be for the IRA to win support.' He still rules out talks with Sinn Fein, however. 'When there is palpable evidence on the ground that they have renounced and denounced violence for political purposes, then we will have a new situation,' he said. The fact that the Ulster Defence Association (UDA), the cover organisation for the Loyalist paramilitaries of the UFF, was proscribed last month, and Sinn Fein was not, is nonetheless being interpreted as a signal to Sinn Fein that the door has not been closed to their eventual inclusion in the talks. The substantive concessions from all sides which will be necessary for progress have thus still to be made, but the fact that negotiations have begun at all suggests that a rethink of old dogmas may be under way. According to Mr Robin Wilson, the editor of Fortnight magazine in Belfast, who through his publication has done much to draw attention to the merits of an EC dimension in any settlement, 'it will be a question of redefining nationalism and unionism in a European context'. Whether that imaginative road will be chosen, remains to be seen. It will be a difficult and politically risky process for all involved, but the price of past failure by Northern Ireland's politicians is already there to be seen - the bomb-damaged buildings of Belfast and a grisly death toll of 3,000 since 1969.

The UN High Commissioner, Mrs Sadako Ogata, yesterday received an assurance to this effect from Mr Karadzic, whom she had telephoned from Geneva. The Bosnian Serb leader, it was reported, was speaking in the presence of President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia. UNHCR spokeswoman Lyndall Sachs said that Mr Karadzic had also promised that aid workers would be allowed to enter the besieged town of Srebrenica and that the sick and wounded could be evacuated. Combatants would also be allowed to leave, on condition that they surrendered their arms. However, the UNHCR had earlier said that it would not allow any convoys to proceed to Srebrenica, after the Serbs had refused to allow them to have a military escort or radio communications. According to UNHCR officials, some 60,000 people were cut off in Srebrenica, which UN relief convoys have failed to reach in 11 months of fighting and where dozens of people a day are dying of hunger, starvation, disease and war wounds. In addition, thousands of refugees from neighbouring Moslem townships captured by Serb militias have swollen the population of Srebrenica and many are sleeping in the open air and suffering from exposure. Mr Karadzic was due to fly to New York yesterday for peace talks with leaders of the other warring parties, under the chairmanship of Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord David Owen. President Alija Izetbegovic of Bosnia, the Moslem leader, was also reported to have left for New York from Sarajevo to attend the peace negotiations. Ms Sachs said that General Philippe Morillon, the UN military commander in Bosnia, who has set up temporary headquarters in Srebrenica in an attempt to make the Serbs let in aid, was due to have more talks later with Bosnian Serb army commanders. France, which has expressed full support for General Morillon, said yesterday that getting international aid into Srebrenica was a test of Serb will to contribute to the peace process in Bosnia. A French Foreign Ministry spokesman said that continued obstacles to the delivery of humanitarian aid to Srebrenica would be a serious blow to the UN Protection Force in the former Yugoslavia.

During the meeting, they discussed bilateral ties and  several  current regional and international issues, including the  situation in the Gulf and Yemen, as well as the Middle East  peace process.    Following the meeting, the Bahraini foreign minister  emphasized that the talks addressed the means to promote and  strengthen bilateral ties, particularly since Bahrain and  Britain are bound by a historical relationship. Noting the  significant developments that are taking place in the region and  the world at large, he said that the meeting has taken place in  critical circumstances.    The Bahraini minister indicated that the talks addressed the  current situation in the Gulf, as well as current developments.  He added that there was an identity of views on these two  issues. He went on to say that he expressed Bahrain's attitude  toward the aggravated situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    The Bahraini foreign minister expressed the belief that the  British Government's position toward the Gulf region and the  Middle East peace process is both positive and constructive.    The Bahraini minister's visit to Britain is part of the  consultations and coordination between the two countries. It is  also meant to promote cooperation between the two countries.

ENOCH POWELL   Peace is preferable to war, and persuasion is preferable to force. Those are truisms which politicians need to respect - as much as, or more than, anyone else. But those who voice doubts about so-called progress (progress to what?) being made as a result of the IRA ceasefire are not breaking that rule. They have solid reasons for their scepticism. The beginning of wisdom in approaching Northern Ireland is to clear the mind of everything conjured up by the term 'sectarian'. If terminology there must be, it is not Catholics who are confronting Protestants - on that basis one could make no sense of the voting pattern at elections - but Irish nationalists confronting unionists. It is nationality, not race, not religion, which is at stake. On the issue of nationhood - that is, the question by whom are we to be governed - there cannot be peace through compromise or negotiation, and in Northern Ireland that is the great paramount issue. The British parliament ruled Ireland - or, what comes to the same thing, Ireland was ruled under the British parliament - from long before the parliamentary union of 1800 seated Irish representatives at Westminster. At the general election of 1918 the inhabitants of the north east of Ireland continued to send representatives to parliament, while the inhabitants of the rest of the island refused. The south voted itself out. Just as surely, the so-called north, meaning the six counties of Ulster, voted to stay in. That determination has not changed on either side since then. Listen to Gerry Adams, and you hear that. Look at the voting at general elections in Ulster, and you see that. The dispute is about nationality - about whom we are to be governed by. That is why it can only be ended if one side or the other is set upon giving way. The impression that there has been a deal done in secret which has not yet been revealed is thoroughly logical. The unionist people of Ulster are not fools. They know that what is at issue is an absolute, and they treat those, from the prime minister downwards, who talk about talks, about political progress, and about compromise and concession, as necessarily dishonest. Short of inventing a method whereby 'a man can serve two masters' there can be no peace in Northern Ireland so long as the right of the majority to their nationality is open to question. All down the years the perception that the British government really wanted rid of Northern Ireland has caused, maintained and fuelled violence. The Irish nationalists are not fools any more than the unionists. They know that the ballot'box will not put them into the nation to which they claim to belong. Ergo alternative methods must be used to bring the desired result about. The true disturber of the peace in Northern Ireland is the stance of British governments which have continually behaved as if they wished Ulster out of the UK. The Anglo-Irish agreement of 1985 was a prime example. Under it, Britain agreed to govern Northern Ireland only in combination with the Irish Republic. Certitude as to the future is the precondition of peaceable living in Northern Ireland. The superficially hard-faced reassertion, in practical terms, that Northern Ireland belongs for good and all to the UK is the sole condition on which tranquility will return. In the end it may be hard to foresee the UK formally withdrawing from the citizens of the north east of Ireland the right they have possessed from time immemorial to be governed within the UK. The day is long past for looking for a wheeze to disguise or to deny that right. That way lies more bloodshed and not less.

A senior Palestinian official said that proposals for a common agenda tabled by Israel yesterday represented a 'considerable narrowing' of the gap between them. Waving a copy of the Israeli document, he said: 'For the first time I feel as if the Israelis are really negotiating. This document, which responds to our proposals of Tuesday, represents a considerable narrowing. With some amendments, which should not be too difficult, this can be a document we will sign. And if we do sign, it will be a real breakthrough because this is not just a procedural matter. There is also political substance to it.' The senior Palestinian official said that he hoped the common agenda would be ready for signing when negotiators returned from a 10-day recess on September 14. All five teams at the Middle East peace talks - Israel, the Palestinians, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon - have also agreed to extend this round of negotiations, the sixth since Madrid, until September 24 to compensate for days lost next week. Most of the Israeli delegation is returning to Jerusalem today for 'intensive consultations'. President George Bush and Mr Lawrence Eagleburger, the acting US secretary of state, are also lending their weight to the process. Mr Bush had a private dinner with King Hussein of Jordan - who is recovering from major surgery - at the White House on Tuesday evening, and Mr Eagleburger is seeing each of the heads of delegation. Mr Yossi Gal, the Israeli spokesman, said yesterday that the negotiating team had worked all night on the common agenda proposals which incorporated ideas put forward by the Palestinians and 'tried to take account of their sensitivities'. He added: 'Every step brings us closer to a common agenda.' The agenda includes such items as the concept for Palestinian self-government in the occupied territories, elections, ideas for peaceful co-existence, and confidence-building measures to be taken in conjunction with negotiations. It was also agreed in principle yesterday to set up two sub-committees on human rights issues and water resources. The senior Palestinian official said he was particularly pleased Israel had included references in its latest document to UN resolution 242, which enshrines the principle of exchanging occupied land for peace. 'This had already been given to the Syrians and Jordanians. Now we have it,too,' he said. Reuter adds from Tel Aviv: Israel's prime minister, Mr Yitzhak Rabin, told a group of industrialists yesterday he expected agreement within a year on a plan for Palestinian self-rule in Israeli-occupied lands.' I have said in the past that I hope to reach agreement within nine to 12 months. With all the difficulties, I still believe it.'  The Financial Times   London Page 6  "

Looking back to the September 1992 elections, Dr. Jonas  Savimbi said that responsibility for the failure of those  elections must be laid at the door of all Angolan political  forces, the West -- which did not help -- and the United  Nations, which did not have the necessary ability to operate in  a country as vast as Angola which, to add to the problem, had  just come out of a 16-year war.

0,FT934-11257 ,"FT934-11257 _AN-DKBDEAB7FT 931102   FT  02 NOV 93 / Unionist party welcomes peace moves      By TIM COONE and DAVID OWEN   MEMBERS of the Ulster Unionist party yesterday welcomed the announcement that the British government would put forward its own proposals for bringing about a lasting peace in Northern Ireland. But they poured cold water on the notion that round-table talks were the right format for discussing the proposals. The UUP's preferred structure would be bilateral meetings between the UK government and the province's constitutional parties. Mr Ken Maginnis, UUP deputy leader and security spokesman, said the party would not sit with Mr John Hume, the leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party, as long as the latter continued his talks with Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein leader. Mr Maginnis called on Downing Street to take a firmer line on terrorism if it expected to get unionists back to the negotiating table. In the wake of one of the worst weeks of sectarian violence in Northern Ireland for two decades, 'the greatest danger now is in doing nothing about terrorism, not doing nothing about talks', he said. Speaking from Peru, where he is official UK observer to the constitutional referendum, Mr Maginnis warned Mr John Major not to be 'panicked into new political measures'. He rejected the Dublin government's six-point plan, announced by Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, last week, as a basis for resuming negotiations. 'The Irish government will try to seize the initiative, and if we move forward solely on the basis of the Spring principles, this opens the door to all sorts of interpretations and which will only increase the level of violence,' he said. A long-time advocate of selective internment of key paramilitary cadres, he said that if internment measures were taken to 'disrupt the command and control structures of the paramilitary organisations, the government would get a very positive response from unionists'. Mr Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionist party, made no direct reference to the possible resumption of round-table talks in Commons remarks that were interpreted as surprisingly conciliatory. But he said many in Ulster were 'alarmed' by some of the Spring plan's contents. Mr John Taylor, UUP Europe spokesman, welcomed Downing Street's intention to bring forward its own proposals but described round-table talks as 'a mistaken formula'. Pressure for such talks to resume was 'misplaced', Mr Taylor argued, calling for new British proposals to be discussed instead in bilateral meetings between Downing Street and the province's constitutional parties. Mr William Ross, UUP chief whip, said the time for talks was past and action was now needed. He joined Mr Maginnis in calling for the government to give 'careful consideration' to selective internment. The aim should be to 'behead' terrorist organisations of their command and control centres, he said. Enough of the terrorist 'godfathers' were identifiable to make a difference. Sir James Kilfedder, the Ulster Popular Unionist MP, said it would be 'sensible and desirable' for talks between the province's constitutional parties to resume as soon as possible. He also called for unequivocal support for the security forces. Mr James Molyneaux, the UUP leader, has so far refrained from commenting in public on the increased pressure on his party to join round-table talks. According to his office he will not do so until Wednesday at the earliest. The party's nine Westminster MPs plan to hold their weekly meeting on Thursday as usual. In Dublin, the foreign ministry expressed disappointment at the unionist reaction to its proposals, but said: 'We must wait for Mr Molyneaux to respond.'   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

The inspection of vessels is at present carried out at sea by Maritime Interception Forces (MIF), stationed in the Tirain Strait, as part of UN sanctions against Iraq. Jordan has claimed the delays caused by the inspections have damaged its economy, and King Hussein warned recently his government would not continue with the Middle East peace talks unless the procedures were altered. Mr Christopher said yesterday after talks with King Hussein, who is recuperating from an ear operation near London, that this system would be replaced by a land-based operation, as demanded by Jordan. Land-based inspections would be performed by the independent Lloyd's Register of Shipping. US officials said the new regime would be as effective, if not more so, than the naval inspections. Long delays at sea are caused by the inspections, while higher-than-normal insurance premiums and the risk of being turned away have caused operators to increase charges by Dollars 1,000 (Pounds 680) per 40ft container. Mr Christopher and King Hussein also discussed efforts to push forward the Middle East peace process and particularly, negotiations between Syria and Israel which are due to resume next month. Mr Christopher is due to visit Riyadh, Cairo, Damascus and Jerusalem. Israel's Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin sought to ease the way for Mr Christopher last week by warning Jewish settlers they would probably have to leave the occupied Golan Heights as part of any lasting agreement with Syria.

President Hafez al-Assad, holding surprise talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in Cairo last night, reaffirmed Syria's demand for a full Israeli withdrawal from the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights and said it would be blasphemy to lease Arab land to Israel. Mr Assad said anyone who thought Syria would accept such a model was 'shamefully wrong' and adoption of this strategy by Israel would lead to the opposite of peace 'even if we live tens or hundreds of years'. Mr Assad's comments came after Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, said he hoped territorial exchange between Israel and Jordan might set a precedent for peace talks with Syria over the return of the Golan, home to 14,000 Jewish settlers and many businesses. Under the Israel-Jordan peace treaty initialled in Amman on Monday Israel will return to Jordan more than 300sq km of occupied territory. In addition Jordan agreed to accept 30sq km of Israeli land in exchange for Jordanian territory being farmed by Israelis and to lease back at least a further 700 acres for 25 years with an option to renew. President Mubarak, who has welcomed the Israeli-Jordanian agreement, also cast doubt on leasing Arab land to Israel, saying 'land is honour'. More criticism against the Israeli-Jordanian agreement came yesterday from Palestinian radical groups based in Damascus and from the extremist Islamic Hamas group, which said the accord favours 'the occupation enemy and contradicts our legitimate Palestinian and Arab rights'. The Palestine Liberation Organisation also attacked the treaty's allocation of a special role to Jordan as the guardian of Islamic holy sites in Arab East Jerusalem, saying it was a 'flagrant violation' the PLO-Israeli agreements and an attempt to legitimise Israeli occupation of the holy city. The statement confirmed mounting PLO-Jordanian tension over the rival claims to Arab East Jerusalem. In Israel, however, the treaty was received with near euphoria. Israeli newspapers lauded Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin as a great man and even ultra-right-wing parties praised the agreement, which appeared to involve no significant Israeli sacrifices. Mr Dan Proper, head of the Israeli Manufacturers' Association, said the move marked a 'big swing forward' for Israel in trade with the world, access to foreign investment and participation in large regional infrastructure projects. Tourism officials forecast large gains to both economies, with at least 1,000 tourists a day crossing between Israel and Jordan. Arkia, a small airline company, announced it would start two flights a day between Amman and Tel Aviv and another company plans to offer a helicopter and limousine service for businessmen. Plans were also unveiled yesterday for an Israeli-Jordanian joint venture to construct a tourism project in the Arava desert. Israeli optimism has been buoyed by President Bill Clinton's decision to attend next Wednesday's signing ceremony at the new border crossing between the Red Sea twin cities of Aqaba and Eilat.

As terrorist experts investigated the cause of the fires  which broke out at seven stores in central London this morning,  Mr Reynolds again stressed there was still no deadline for an  IRA response to December's joint initiative.    The Dublin premier was speaking before new talks at Downing  Street with John Major on prospects for ending the terrorism --  against a background of the Oxford Street firebombings at the  end of last month and renewed IRA violence earlier this week.    The new IRA attacks -- including the first murder this year  -- were being seen as a thumbs-down for the talks process.    But Mr Reynolds said: ""If somebody thinks I'll just give up  because we have another unfortunate killing or attacks, they  should know it is not going to stop me.    ""We are on a mission of peace and will continue with it  until  we are absolutely satisfied there is no hope left. That is the  way I feel at the moment -- and I am going to continue on that  road.""    Mr Reynolds arrived in London last night with Deputy Premier  and Foreign Minister Dick Spring for their first meeting with Mr  Major and Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew since  the December 15 signing of the Ulster declaration.    Early indications were that this morning's store attacks  were  carried out by the IRA. The outbreaks were caused by incendiary  devices which bore ""all the hallmarks of the Provisional IRA"",  said Scotland Yard.    But the Irish team made clear they were more determined than  ever to keep alive the prospects for peace.    As Mr Reynolds consulted officials before heading for  Downing  Street, he agreed the renewed terrorism -- demonstrated by both  the IRA and loyalist paramilitaries in Belfast this week -- was  ""disappointing"".    He asserted, however: ""I am still very hopeful of the  chances  for peace. There has been considerable progress already as I  see it. I have said from the very start that I did not believe  there would be a quick decision on the part of the republican  movement.    ""Their decision is of historic proportions, and it will  inevitably take time. There is an intense debate going on in  Ireland north and south among the republicans.""    Mr Reynolds said he thought there was considerable support  from members of the IRA and Sinn Fein for the peace declaration  in the run-up to their annual conference in Dublin next weekend.    ""I have no intention of setting a deadline. That is not the  way we are going to get a result at the end of the day,"" he  added, basing his assessment on contacts he has had with  community leaders on both sides of the Ulster border.    After their talks, Mr Major and Mr Reynolds will join the  crowd at the England-Ireland rugby international at Twickenham.    Later, in what sounded like a direct message to Sinn Fein,  Mr  Reynolds said there was sufficient in the explanations and  clarifications of the Downing Street Declaration ""to enable the  debate to come to a conclusion"".    Considerable progress had been made towards peace since the  publication of the declaration in mid-December, he told BBC  Radio 4's Today programme shortly before his Downing Street  talks.    ""I have said from the start I did not believe there would be  any quick decision in this regard. I think the intense debate  that is continuing in the republican movement is what I expected  it to be -- very intense. For them to come to a decision of  historic proportions will inevitably take time.""    While he thought there was growing support among  nationalists  for peace ""a slim majority would not really be acceptable among  the republican movement.    ""Nobody wants a split in that movement again -- the split in  the 1970's brought the last 25 years of violence and we do not  want another 25 years of violence.

0,FT934-2666 ,"FT934-2666 _AN-DLMDEABKFT 931213   FT  13 DEC 93 / Irish rivals both aim at Major: Disquiet surfaces in Dublin as Ulster unionists threaten to withdraw parliamentary backing      By PHILIP STEPHENS and TIM COONE      LONDON, DUBLIN   Mr John Major last night faced conflicting pressures from the Dublin government and the Ulster unionists as the weekend murder by the IRA of two Northern Ireland policemen cast a shadow over the Anglo-Irish peace initiative. Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, said that after their Brussels' meeting he had agreed with Mr Major some '70 per cent' of the proposed joint statement they hope might persuade the IRA to end violence. That raised expectations that two leaders could hold a further meeting this week to clear the remaining obstacles. Officials from both governments worked through the weekend on the text and Mr Major and Mr Reynolds plan to speak on the phone later today to assess progress. As Mr Major consulted cabinet colleagues, Downing Street still appeared hopeful of a pre-Christmas accord. But the Irish prime minister warned he was not prepared to sign an anodyne declaration which would not offer a reasonable prospect of a permanent cessation of violence. Amid pessimism in Dublin on the prospects for a substantive statement, Mr Reynolds said that guarantees for the Protestant majority in Ulster had to be balanced by recognition of the nationalist aspirations of a large minority. The key differences now centre on the issues of self-determination and on Dublin's proposal for an all-Ireland convention, involving all political parties north and south. Mr Reynolds signalled in Brussels that he could accept a statement which did not explicitly endorse the 'value' of eventual unity. But Dublin's acceptance of a unionist veto over any change in Ulster's status had to be set in the wider context of Irish self-determination. Irish government officials reaffirmed yesterday that Mr Reynolds 'will not sign a statement that will not achieve the result of a cessation of violence'. If agreement could not be reached, a final pre-Christmas summit was unlikely. The two governments' task in attempting to square the circle between unionist fears and nationalist terrorism was underlined by a blunt warning from two leading members of the Ulster Unionist party directed at Mr Major. Mr John Taylor, MP for Stangford, said any move towards a united Ireland would prompt his party to threaten the government's majority by opposing it in any vote of confidence. Mr David Trimble, MP for Upper Bann, accused Mr Reynolds of 'effectively acting on behalf of the IRA'. He said Mr Reynolds, by taking on the Hume-Adams proposals, was talking about 'surrender by stages' to the IRA. He rejected any concessions to Mr Reynolds's proposals and ruled out the possibility of agreeing to a peace conference representing all parties in the republic and Northern Ireland. But Mr Gerry Adams, the leader of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, repeated his call for Irish self-determination. He said acceptance of the need for majority consent in Northern Ireland had to be seen as an interim part of a process towards national self-determination. Meanwhile Sir Hugh Annesley, chief constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, said that the IRA had nothing to offer Northern Ireland except death and suffering. His comments came after two police officers were shot dead by IRA gunmen at Five-miletown in Fermanagh. Several people were arrested.   Countries:-  IEZ  Ireland, EC.     GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt was accompanied by Lt. Gen. Maung Thint,  minister of progress of border areas and national races and  development affairs; Lt. Gen. Kyaw Min, minister of mines; Vice  Admiral Than Nyunt, minister of health; Brigadier General Myo  Thant, minister of information; Colonel Pe Thein, minister of  education; U Soe Tha, minister of communications, post, and  telegraph; responsible officials from the Office of the SLORC;  directors general and managing directors from departments  concerned; and other responsible officials. [passage omitted]    Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt and his entourage proceeded to the  Northern Military Command headquarters where they were welcomed  by Kachin national leaders. Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt, SLORC  secretary-1; and Major General Saw Lwin, chairman of Kachin  State Law and Order Restoration Council and commander of the  Northern Command, then held a separate meeting with the KIO  [Kachin Independence Organization] leaders -- U Mali Zut Zaw  Mai, U Lamon Tu Jai, U Gori Zaw Saing --and intermediaries -- U  Lawan, U Sabwegyun, and U Khun Myat in the office of the  commander. [passage omitted]    [Begin recording] [Khin Nyunt] Today can be described as an  auspicious day for the Union of Myanmar [Burma], for the entire  national people, for Kachin State, and for the indigenous people  residing in Kachin State. I describe today as auspicious  because the peace talks between our SLORC delegation and the KIO  delegation have reached a successful conclusion [nyein-chan-ye  sway-ne-hmu aungmyinhmu ya de achay-ahne myo yauk te atwet].    This is attributed to our mutual consultations and talks  following the state's goodwill invitation to the armed  organizations in the jungle to return to the legal fold. The  KIO held honest and sincere talks after realizing the genuine  goodwill of the state. Following these talks, our two sides  reached an understanding and we were able to realize peace as a  result. [end recording]    Continuing, Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt said that since Myanmar's  independence 40 years ago, there has been armed conflict with  the KIO for over 30 years due to differences of views. However,  conditions have changed under the SLORC administration. He said  there can be a problem in a family due to differences of opinion  among the family members, but such a problem is only temporary  and they are not antagonisms which last for a lifetime.       He said it is our conviction that the time has come for  indigenous people to reunite and reconcile. Therefore, the  SLORC has invited the indigenous armed organizations to return  to the legal fold. He said the two sides have reached  agreements and achieved peace because the KIO, which welcomed  the government's invitation, has held honest and sincere talks  with mutual understanding.    [Begin Khin Nyunt recording] We have reached this stage.  So, what do we do for the next stage? We must work for  progress and development of the Kachin State and the ministers  and senior departmental heads have come along with me to do this  work. We will work for the progress and development of Kachin  State with these persons.    I estimate that Kachin State has lagged behind in  development  for over 20 years. We will all work in unison with momentum and  cooperate in order to make up for the backwardness. The  government will provide assistance and the indigenous people  residing in the Kachin State as well as the KIO must cooperate.  I dare say that if the three sides cooperate and work in  unison, the development of Kachin State, which has lagged  behind, will accelerate. [end recording]    Continuing, Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt said that in setting  priorities for development projects, priority will first be  given to construction of roads and bridges, opening of hospitals  and clinics under the health sector and schools under the  education sector, and promotion of appropriate technology and  crops which are suitable to local conditions under the  agriculture and livestock breeding sector. He said there is  plenty of land suitable for forestry and cultivation of crops in  Kachin State, but land has not been cultivated due to armed  conflict. If these lands are reclaimed and put under  cultivation, the economy of the state will develop at an  accelerated rate.    Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt explained that endeavors for national  development schemes and national unity during the SLORC  administration of over five years are known to all. Endeavors  are being made with the objective of developing Myanmar into a  modern and developed nation on one hand, while efforts are being  made for the emergence of a firm constitution while upholding  the three cardinal causes -- nondisintegration of the union,  nondisintegration of national unity, and perpetuation of  national sovereignty. Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt explained that  priority is being given to border region development with a view  to promoting unity among national people while drug eradication  is also carried out. At the same time, he explained, the state  has been working for peace with genuine goodwill by inviting the  armed organizations in the jungle to return to the legal fold.    He said mutual understanding has been reached with the KIO  today and that outstanding success has been achieved and he  attributed the success to the mutual goodwill and sincere  efforts of the state government and the KIO. He said he  believed that peace could certainly be achieved if the remaining  Karen, Mon, and Karenni armed organizations in the jungles hold  frank, cordial, and sincere talks with the state government with  genuine goodwill.    Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt said that the KIO will have to continue  to work in order to participate legally in the process of  emerging a firm constitution. He said once there is a  constitution, Kachin State will be led by Kachin nationals and  other states will be led by their nationals concerned. In order  to have such leadership, it is necessary for all nationals to  participate in working for a firm constitution.    Continuing, Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt explained that the National  Convention has obtained 104 basic principles on which such a  firm constitution should be based and that panel discussions are  being held to discuss details of the basic principles relating  to each chapter. Once the discussions are completed, [the  reports] will be submitted to a plenary session of the National  Convention. Details relating to the 104 basic principles such as  the chapter heading on the state, state structure, and head of  state are currently under discussion. He said the KIO needs to  observe the National Convention.    Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt said the ministers and departmental  heads  in his entourage have prepared for the development of Kachin  State. He disclosed that the Ministry of Progress of Border  Areas and National Races and Development Affairs has allocated  over kyat 20 million for building Myitkyina-Tanai-Nanyun Road,  Mogaung-Kamaing-Longin Road, Hopin-Kontha-Nyaungbin Road and  that electric generators, motor vehicles, and assistance have  been collected for distribution. He said priority will be given  to agriculture in working to develop Kachin State and the state  will provide technology, machinery, seeds, and fertilizers in  the areas where the state wants the KIO to give priority. If  the peasants work hard the development of Kachin State, which  has fertile lands, will accelerate. He said the state will set  up economic enterprises which are viable. He explained that as  Kachin State becomes peaceful and prosperous, travel throughout  the state will become possible and international tourism will  develop. He said international tourists will be interested in  Indawgyi region and confluence point [of Irrawaddy River] and if  these areas are made attactive, the development will take place  in a short time.    Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt said that if the people of Kachin State  endeavor and work together in unity, and if the KIO cooperates  in areas where it is able, then Kachin State will certainly  develop.    In conclusion, he said, the SLORC is striving with genuine  goodwill to reestablish solidarity among the national peoples,  ensure the perpetuation of national sovereignty, prevent any  loss of national independence, and strive toward the emergence  of a modern and developed nation. He said now that the KIO has  joined hands with the SLORC in these endeavors, there will be  greater momentum in our work. He said he could see that the  Union of Myanmar will emerge as a modern and developed nation in  the near future if the remaining indigenous armed organizations  come to realize the genuine goodwill of the national government,  as the KIO has, and work hand in hand with honesty and  sincerity. Therefore, he said, the time has now come for the  national peoples and indigenous armed organizations to join  hands with the state government with genuine goodwill, the  correct attitude, and honesty.    Next, Kachin national leader U Zaw Mai [KIO deputy chairman]  delivered a speech. He said the KIO took up arms and went  underground in the jungle in 1960-61 when its demands for the  rights the Kachins lost prior to 1962 and during the era of the  AFPFL [Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League] government were  rejected. He said there was a plan to establish a separate state  at that time. After much political experience, however, we  conducted a review to determine whether our policy was correct.  We then adopted a policy of not seceding from the union. But  there are still groups that have not accepted this decision.  They are observing the situation. They will gradually develop  faith in the government when they witness the success of  projects carried out with genuine goodwill by the state  government.    [Begin Zaw Mai recording] What kind of goodwill does the  SLORC government currently have toward the country? We will  observe whether these are only words or if they are carried out  in practice. I have studied the state leaders' speeches in  detail. I have also studied the radio and newspapers as well as  the (?personalities). Only after four or five years, the SLORC  government's goodwill toward the national peoples and the  nation. [sentence as heard] Of course, there is one thing: The  SLORC government is human; we are all human. We cannot say  everything done by humans is correct and complete.    Then there was the state government's invitation to the  armed  organizations in the jungles to come out and hold talks. They  went to the extent of saying that if we did not like it we could  go back and continue to fight. At first, I thought they could  possibly be correct. U Bran Seng, our chairman, submitted it to  the Central Committee, and it was discussed thoroughly at the  central level. We deliberated whether the time had come to make  peace; whether it was supported by the people. The government  side welcomed it, but what was the people's view? We  deliberated for two years, considering what our views were  toward the present government. We sent people throughout Kachin  State. We sent them everywhere -- Putao, (Hopet), Tanai,  Mogaung, Mohnyin, Bhamo, Shwegu, and the Kachin region in  Northern Shan State -- and asked for the people's views. We did  not ask everyone. We asked people who had political knowledge or  were interested in politics. These people included veteran  politicians, former senior public servants, and educated people.  The general view was that the situation was good, and we were  urged to try. We were advised to watch what they were doing,  and if it did not work to go back to the jungle, as allowed by  the Myanmar Government side. We were urged to try, and our  Central Committee took the matter under consideration.    After that, our Central Committee adopted a policy that  said:  Do not promise what you cannot fulfill, but once a promise is  made follow through; that is, do not go back on your word. Once  we decided to undertake something, we must implement it  accurately. Once we decided to undertake something, we must  adopt a policy -- a plan -- on how to proceed from one step to  another. We must set a goal. We adopted a policy of  participating in some capacity in an endeavor to obtain genuine  peace and establish a new nation. It is believed that a  peaceful and prosperous Kachin State will contribute to the  union. We decided to begin in accordance with this policy. Now  it has been over a year since we began the peace talks with the  government. The government and our intermediaries -- three  people -- patiently initiated this work. That is why, at this  moment, I would like to say that I will work for the peace and  prosperity of the entire Kachin State as well as the peace and  prosperity of the entire union. [end recording]    Maj. Gen. Saw Lwin, commander and chairman of the Kachin  State Law and Order Restoration Council, then explained about  the renovation and construction of roads and bridges in Kachin  State. After his explanation, the secretary-1 presented gifts  to the Kachin national leaders and took a group photograph with  them.    The State Law and Order Restoration Council, with a view to  reestablishing national unity and building peace, held sincere  and frank talks with the KIO delegation that were marked by  perseverance and mutual effort. The two sides held five rounds  of talks in 1993 in Myitkyina, the capital of Kachin State.  Understandings and agreements on a cease-fire were reached on  the morning of 23 February 1994 [apyit-akhat yat-saing-ye  saing-yar nar le thabawtunhyi-hmu-myar ko].    In the evening, Maj. Gen. Saw Lwin, commander and chairman  of  the Kachin State Law and Order Restoration Council, hosted a  dinner at the Malihka Mansion in honor of the secretary-1,  ministers, and national leaders.

0,FT944-16986 ,"FT944-16986 _AN-EJKDGACLFT 941011   FT  11 OCT 94 / The Conservatives in Bournemouth: Step-by-step response to IRA considered      By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor   The British government is considering a step-by-step response to the IRA ceasefire in Northern Ireland amid acknowledgement among senior ministers that it may never be given an unequivocal pledge that it is permanent. The idea that the government should open a 'reversible' dialogue with Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, will be considered by Mr John Major and cabinet colleagues next week. Ministers accept that in spite of worrying comments in recent days by senior Sinn Fein officials and of evidence that the IRA is maintaining its military capability, the signs are that the republicans intend the ceasefire to be permanent. A staged response - perhaps involving first the lifting of the exclusion orders on prominent Sinn Fein members and the re-opening of indirect contacts - would allow the government to be seen to be responding positively while maintaining the option of withdrawing contacts. Such an approach would allow the government to test further Sinn Fein's commitment to a permanent peace by exploring whether the IRA was ready to give up its arms and ammunition. No decisions will be taken during this week's Conservative party conference but ministers are expected to consider a detailed assessment of the situation in the province on their return to Whitehall next week. The government faces a potentially hostile response to its Northern Ireland policy on Thursday when a number of party activists intend to press for the full integration of the province into the UK. But Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, hinted at the change of tack yesterday. He said that the government was still not satisfied that the IRA had halted violence permanently, before adding: 'If we are not satisfied at the moment, we do not know for sure that we will ever be.' Sir Patrick said in Belfast that there had been 'encouraging progress' but the government was fully justified in its caution. He rejected suggestions from Mr Peter Temple-Morris, the Conservative backbench MP, that Mr Major would accept the permanence of the ceasefire soon after this week's conference but did not rule out a more limited response.

Only a handful of MPs from mainland constituencies expressed reservations about the declaration, and Mr John Major, the prime minister, was given strong support by key backbenchers on both sides. Conservative MPs cheered as Mr Major challenged Sinn Fein, the political arm of the IRA, to accept the challenge to condemn violence and join the political process. Reaction from the Conservative back benches was largely positive, although a handful of MPs suggested that the agreement represented a weakening of Britain's commitment to Northern Ireland. Others called for assurances that the fight against terrorism would continue, and urged the government to insist on a surrender of weapons and explosives by the IRA before entering into talks with Sinn Fein. In Belfast last night Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, signalled on a television discussion programme that the IRA might be required to surrender its arsenal of weapons before being accepted into the political process. Mr Andrew Hunter, the influential chairman of the Conservative backbench Northern Ireland committee, said the declaration was 'a positive step forward'. But there were cheers as he urged the prime minister to 'ensure that there is no let-up in the hunt for those who perpetrate violence'. Mr Peter Temple-Morris, a senior Conservative backbencher, said the declaration was supported by the UK-Irish Inter Parliamentary Body, of which he is joint chairman. Mr Tom King, a former Northern Ireland secretary, said the declaration contained nothing to seriously threaten the interests of any part of the Northern Ireland community. Few MPs expressed concern about the permanence of the links between Northern Ireland and the UK. However, Mr Tony Marlow, the Conservative MP for Northampton North, said there was 'a danger that people will say that the prime minister of the UK is careless with regard to the integrity of the UK'. Mr Nicholas Winterton, the Conservative MP for Macclesfield, welcomed the prime minister's commitment to peace, but urged him to go to Northern Ireland to campaign for the union. The declaration was welcomed 'with enthusiasm' by Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, and by Mr Alan Beith for the Liberal Democrats. Most Labour backbenchers also welcomed the declaration. Mr Doug Hoyle, MP for Warrington North - in whose constituency two boys were killed by an IRA bomb this year - said the terrorists would never be forgiven if they failed to respond. 'It is time for all the paramilitaries to lay down their arms,' he said. The declaration was criticised by some Labour leftwingers. Mr Tony Benn, a former cabinet minister, said public opinion in Britain would support talks with Sinn Fein in advance of a cessation of violence.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

It was the first terrorist murder in the province since a blueprint for a peace accord was agreed more than a fortnight ago by Mr John Major and Mr Albert Reynolds. The 23-year-old soldier was the ninth member of the security forces killed by IRA snipers in the border areas of south Armagh and County Fermanagh in the past two years. The shooting underlined the increasingly hardline tone of republican paramilitary groups towards the document from the two premiers. Mr John Fee, a Social Democratic and Labour party councillor who lives near Crossmaglen, said of the shooting: 'There are many throughout the nationalist and republican community who will be saying this should not have happened.' The shooting came amid growing discontent in the Ulster Unionist party, the largest unionist party. UUP support is seen by the two governments as essential to the success of the peace initiative. Sir John Wheeler, security minister at the Northern Ireland Office, condemned the shooting as a 'wicked crime', but he stopped short of threatening a security clampdown. The hardening of attitudes among republicans has prompted calls from unionist leaders for immediate tougher government security measures. It has also fuelled doubts about the peace process among some UUP members. UUP leaders said that yesterday's shooting would not be allowed to derail the peace process. Although the leadership's cautious endorsement of the premiers' declaration appears to have wide support, the tactics have also provoked anger. One UUP councillor said: 'There's a lot of people here who are very unhappy with the declaration.' Mr Ken Maginnis, UUP MP for Fermanagh and South Tyrone, said dissenters were a minority in the party. The Rev Roy Magee, a Belfast minister who has had talks with loyalist paramilitary groups, said they had been prepared to give the peace process a chance. But yesterday's shooting of the soldier might threaten that.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P9721 International Affairs.   Types:-  NEWS  General News.

The statement,  issued on 27 February, showed optimism that the cease-fire  agreement between the KNPLF and the SLORC would be signed in the  near future. It stated that the present world situation and  Myanmar's [Burma] circumstances have shown that all political  problems can be solved peacefully by negotiation. Myanmar,  which is part of the international community, should resolve  ethnic problems and armed insurrections peacefully using  political means. The KNPLF, for the good of all the people in  the Karenni State -- who have suffered bitterly from the civil  war which has been going on for more than 40 years -- has  decided to hold talks with the SLORC. The statement also noted  that the decision was made to stop the use of Karenni people as  forced labor, prevent forced relocation, and overcome economic  difficulties. In accordance with SLORC's invitation of 18  November 1993 to hold talks with ethnic armed organizations, the  KNPLF sent Lieutenant Colonel Tin Tun to hold talks with the  SLORC on 18 December 1993. Colonel Maung Kyi, Major Zaw Thet  Naing from the No.27 military intelligence unit, and other  members from the SLORC's side held talks with Col. Tun Kyaw,  KNPLF vice chairman and commander in chief, and a delegation in  Me Thet Village, Loikaw Township, on 8 February 1994. Religious  leaders -- Roman Catholic Bishop Sotero Phamo and Baptist Pastor  Saw Ambia -- attended the meeting as observers.    The KNPLF hopes that the SLORC will be able to sign a  cease-fire agreement in the near future and believes the  bilateral talks will lead to peace for the benefit of the  Karenni people and for the development of peace, tranquility,  democracy, and harmony in the Karenni State.

As pressure continued to mount on London to depart from its cautious stance, Downing Street said that there was a continuing need to 'be clear that the IRA's violence had ended for good'. It said ministers would 'keep the situation under close review'. The comments followed the first full meeting of the cabinet since July, at which ministers were briefed on the Ulster situation by Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary. Mr John Major is expected to visit the province soon. Meanwhile Mr Andrew Hunter, the pro-unionist chairman of the Tory backbench Northern Ireland committee, last night fuelled speculation that the six-year-old broadcasting ban on representatives of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, might be lifted. He said: 'The time may soon come when it is right to lift the ban.' Ministers are thought to have agreed in principle that the ban should go. Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, urged London to accept the IRA ceasefire as permanent 'as soon as they can', warning that any delay might be used by loyalist paramilitaries as an excuse for violence. But he accepted that the timing of the decision had to be taken by London 'and they have to bring the unionist population with them'. Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, accused Mr Major of 'trawling around for excuses not to get involved'. Britain has promised to start talks on how to admit Sinn Fein into the political process within three months of a permanent end to violence. A poll for The Guardian by ICM published today showed that only 13 per cent of those questioned believed the violence would cease for good.

His comments came as Mr John Hume, leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party, started the first of a series of visits to the US by senior Ulster politicians. Mr Hume, who is likely to meet Mr Al Gore, US vice-president, tomorrow, will be followed by a group of senior Ulster Unionist politicians and almost certainly by Mr Adams. US, Irish and UK officials are understood to have been working behind the scenes to ensure that the visits by Mr Hume and the UUP representatives precede and have a higher profile at official level than that of Mr Adams. The Sinn Fein leader is expected to start his US visit on the west coast next weekend. Meanwhile in Saudi Arabia Mr Major said the IRA was 'very close' to providing acceptable assurances that its open-ended ceasefire was permanent. The prime minister's remarks came three days after he challenged republican leaders to use last week's lifting of the government's broadcasting ban on Sinn Fein to provide the assurances he was looking for. But Sir Patrick Mayhew, speaking in Londonderry, appeared to adopt a sterner note when asked if he was satisfied that IRA violence was over for good. The Northern Ireland secretary said: 'No. I do not think that we have been given that assertion. I can only go upon the words and the deeds of those who have used violence here in Northern Ireland for the last 25 years and killed something like 3,000 people.'

US and Russian co-sponsors of the forum feared the issue of Palestinian representation could provoke a walkout by the Israeli delegation. PLO calls for the Palestinian delegation in Moscow to include representatives from the diaspora, among them Jerusalem-born Palestinians, have cast a shadow over the multilateral talks, the third stage of the latest Middle East peace effort launched in Madrid last October. Seeking to play down the argument, US and Russian officials made it clear the Palestinian delegation must be restricted to the 'Madrid formula' allowing only representatives from the West Bank and Gaza strip, occupied by Israel in the 1967 war. A two-tier Palestinian delegation was due in Moscow last night. At the Madrid opening last October, the Palestinian team included representatives from east Jerusalem, but these did not participate directly in the discussions with Israel. Representatives from about 18 countries, including permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, are expected to sit down today in Moscow's Hall of Unions to discuss such issues as regional disarmament, economic development, water and the environment. Syria and Lebanon are boycotting the talks, claiming Israel has shown no commitment to a Middle East settlement based on the 'land for peace' formula outlined in United Nations Security Council resolutions. Radical Palestinians have condemned Arab participation. The US wants to use the Moscow meeting - involving Israel for the first time in discussing Middle East questions with Egypt, Jordan, and Turkey as well as Arabs from the Gulf and Africa - to lessen the Jewish state's regional isolation. Israel and delegations representing Syria, Lebanon and a Jordanian Palestinian team have conducted three rounds of bilateral talks in Madrid and in Washington marked by procedural argument. Mr James Baker, the US secretary of state and originator of this latest Middle East peace effort, is anxious for the Moscow meeting to establish the framework for tackling multilateral Middle East issues before the general election in Israel later this year brings the peace process at least to a temporary halt.

Velayati who is here on an official visit said at a press  conference here today that Iran will also follow its policy to  resolve the current crises in the world through boosting  regional and international cooperation.    Asked about Gaza-Jericho compromise accord, Velayati said,  ""We believe that the current peace process was not in the  interest of Palestinian nation and peace and security in the  region. Palestine belongs to all the Palestinians on that land  and an individual or a certain group can not impose their views  upon the Palestinian people.""    Despite the declared Palestinian control"" over Gaza and  Jericho, the problems of Palestine still remain to be solved, he  said.    More than 200 Jewish townships exist in the region, the  problem of Qods [Jerusalem], Palestinian refugees and Golan  Heights remain unresolved and the southern Lebanon is still  under zionist occupation, he said.    On the date of his upcoming visit to Baghdad, Velayati said  that an expert delegation will go to Baghdad and will designate  the date for the visit of the two countries' foreign ministers.    He described the United Nations Resolution 598 as the ground  for consolidation of Tehran-Baghdad relations and said that the  implementation of the United Nations resolution positive steps  [as received] would be taken to strengthen bilateral relations.    Asked about Iran's view on the developments in Yemen,  Velayati said that Iran's policy favors unity and territorial  integrity of Yemen. ""We believe that the crisis in Yemen can be  resolved through peaceful means,"" velayati Said.    On Iran's support for Bosnian Muslims, he said that despite  some claims, Iran has not dispatched forces to interfere in  Bosnian affairs directly. Instead it has repeatedly announced  its readiness to dispatch 10,000-strong peacekeeping force to  Bosnia under the banner of the Nia Oionsxmh [as received].  Answering a question on the export of the revolution, Velayati  said that Iran was against the so called forcible export of the  revolution, calling the allegation that Iran is using force to  promote its revolution as ""the fabrication of the western  propaganda machine.""    The Islamic Republic of Iran regards strengthening of  regional cooperation as an important principle and makes efforts  to expand activities of the Economic Cooperation Organization  (ECO) and the organization of the Caspian Sea Littoral States to  stregthen ties among neighbouring states, he said.

Mr Martin McGuinness, Sinn Fein chief of staff, said last night: 'Patrick Mayhew read a text which he claims to be a communication sent by me to the British government in late February. I totally refute his claim. The text he read is a counterfeit. No such communication was ever sent. 'It is a lie, yet another lie which has emanated from Patrick Mayhew and John Major in recent times.' His comparison of the version of a March 19 document indicated 'they are now counterfeiting their own documents to meet their current needs'. He said the version of a communication sent by Sinn Fein to Sir Patrick on May 10, and the circumstances surrounding it, were 'equally at variance with the truth and will be proved to be so'. He added: 'His claim that a communication of November 2 to the British Government was from Sinn Fein is equally bogus.' Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, accused the British government of being behind the leaking by unionist politicians of details of secret talks between intermediaries and Sinn Fein. He said that the aim was to divert 'public attention from IRA conditions for peace and to sow confusion and division among republicans.' Four hours before Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, spoke to the Commons, Mr Adams held a press conference in Belfast to release three documents - two from UK government representatives and one from Sinn Fein. He said they made clear that 'the British were quite blatantly abusing the lines of communication for their own narrow short-term interests'. But he produced no documents to support his central allegation that an IRA offer in March of a two-week ceasefire in return for talks had been rejected by the UK government for 'internal political reasons', missing an opportunity for peace days before the IRA's Bishopsgate bomb attack. Neither the press conference nor the documents drew attention to the fact that the IRA had continued its bombing campaign in the province and on the mainland. The press conference was preceded by an IRA attack on a police barracks in Belfast. The attack was small and caused no injuries, consistent with the IRA's apparent decision not to mount a spectacular attack prior to the Dublin summit. But it was a reminder of its capacity to act in the absence of a political breakthrough.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P8651 Political Organizations.

His intervention is a clear indication of concern at the highest levels of the German government over the damage done to the country's international reputation by the row over the alleged theft of industrial secrets. Chancellor Helmut Kohl, as well as Mr Rexrodt himself, has already publicly urged the two sides to settle their differences. Mr Rexrodt invited Mr David Herman, chairman of Adam Opel, for talks at the economics ministry in Bonn last night and he has agreed on a similar meeting with Mr Ferdinand Piech, the VW chairman, to be held on Friday. Both companies have agreed to the discussions. A ministry spokeswoman said Mr Rexrodt was not seeking to mediate directly in the dispute, in which GM has accused VW of industrial espionage and the theft of confidential docu-ments. 'He is merely seeking to inform himself about the situation, and about the arguments on both sides,' she said. The move was immediately welcomed by VW as a step towards peace talks between the two companies. They have been at loggerheads since Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, former global purchasing director for GM, defected to VW in March. GM accused Mr Lopez and several associates of systematically plundering industrial secrets before their departure. There was less enthusiasm from senior officials at Opel, who insist that before the two companies can sit down together Mr Piech must withdraw what Opel sees as anti-American accusations against GM, and his suggestion that the US company was somehow responsible for planting its secret documents on VW employees. In a furious outburst last month, Mr Piech suggested GM was trying to damage VW in a commercially motivated war. This week he underscored his commitment to his production director, repeating that he would 'put my hand in the fire' for Mr Lopez. Opel officials added yesterday that the company would not enter peace talks while the German legal authorities were in the middle of an investigation into allegations of theft, industrial espionage and fraud. At VW, Mr Otto Wachs, a company spokesman, said the Rexrodt initiative was 'very much to be welcomed, because it supports us in our efforts to talk to each other. For two weeks we have been trying to initiate talks with Opel, but so far without success,' he said. Yesterday, Mr Georg Nauth, spokesman for the public prosecutor's office in Darmstadt, which is responsible for the investigation, expressed some doubt about VW's move to appoint independent assessors KPMG Deutsche Treuhand. He insisted his office was already in possession of more information than would be available to an independent investigator. 'An independent investigator cannot undertake searches, cannot confiscate documents, and cannot make inquiries at Opel,' he said.

The talks would be separate from the 10-nation peace conference in Minsk, the Belarus capital, which was set up on Tuesday by the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE). Mr Raffi Hovannisian, Armenian foreign minister, announced the trilateral meeting between Armenia, Azerbaijan and representatives of Nagorno-Karabakh, which is inhabited mainly by Armenian Christians but administered by Azerbaijan. He had earlier held talks in the margin of the CSCE ministerial conference with Mr Hikmet Cetin, his Turkish opposite number - the first Turkish-Armenian meeting at this level since Armenia declared independence from the Soviet Union. Mr Hovannisian said Armenians had also been in touch with Azerbaijan at the highest level, through Mr James Baker, US secretary of state, and the Turkish foreign minister. Mr Hovannisian said the place and date of the trilateral meeting remained to be decided, but he hoped it would take place in Nagorno-Karabakh. It would be held 'in parallel' with the wider CSCE meeting. The talks would address a ceasefire, the lifting of the Azerbaijani economic blockade on Armenia, and the return of weapons which have been taken by combatants from the former Soviet army. Mr Hovannisian stressed that no CSCE talks could be successful unless representatives of Nagorno-Karabakh were allowed to participate in their own right. Under a compromise reached by CSCE ministers on Tuesday, representatives of the enclave will be invited to the conference as 'interested parties' by the chairman of the talks, after consultation with the participating states. Mr Jiri Dienstbier, the Czechoslovak foreign minister and current chairman of the CSCE, told the ministerial meeting he would go to Nagorno-Karabakh next Monday to prepare the 10-nation peace conference. 'I expect that the ceasefire mediated through Iranian efforts, which are appreciated, will be extended,' he said. Mr Dienstbier attacked CSCE member states who he said had spent more than two years exchanging assurances about the collapse of totalitarianism and the progress of democracy, while failing to react adequately to dangerous developments. The future of the European Community, Nato, the Western European Union and the CSCE itself was secure only to the extent that they were able to deal with the fundamental changes that had occurred in Europe and elsewhere, he said. The rights of national minorities in an increasingly fragmented Europe emerged as one of the main themes of the Helsinki follow-up conference. Mr Hans van den Broek, the Dutch foreign minister, strongly supported by his German colleague, Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, proposed the appointment of a CSCE High Commissioner for Minorities, whose task would be to provide early warning and early action to prevent 'simmering conflicts which have not yet come to an explosion'.

Russia's efforts for disputes to be resolved  peacefully, through talks and impartial mediation by the  international community, were assessed as positive.    Milosevic and Churkin said they expected commitment to peace  to be the essential feature of the further negotiations on the  former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, and set out that  commitment to peace was a basis for the reaching of a political  agreement and the fulfillment of the national and state  interests of the three warring sides.    Before meeting with Milosevic, Churkin conferred with  presidents Radovan Karadzic of the Bosnian Serb Republic (R.S.)  and Milan Martic of the Republic of Serb Krajina (RSK). The talk  with Martic was part of a new Russian initiative for peace on  the RSK territory, which is a U.N. protected area (UNPA).  Churkin said after meeting with Martic that representatives of  Croatia and the (republic of) Serb Krajina would meet at the  Russian Embassy in Zagreb on March 22 to discuss the cessation  of hostilities. Churkin said he felt it was impossible to  resolve the Bosnia-Herzegovina conflict without resolving the  Croatia-Krajina problem.    The RSK was created in 1991 out of the predominantly  Serb-populated areas within the administrative borders of the  former Yugoslav republic of Croatia in response to Croatia's  secession and the attempt of its authorities to reduce the Serb  people to a national minority. The RSK was proclaimed a U.N.  protected area (UNPA) in March last year.     "

He spoke as hopes of a breakthrough in the Bosnian peace talks in New York dwindled. Mr Clinton said details of the new measures would be revealed soon. The announcement came as Russia said it would join the US in making air-drops of humanitarian aid in eastern Bosnia. Starting in a week, Ilyushin military transporters would drop 260 tons of aid over a two-week period. Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, the UN and EC mediators, met Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic for three hours yesterday and scheduled a meeting with him today. The talks took place in his New York hotel after the Bosnian leader complained he was feeling unwell. He cancelled a previously announced plan to leave for home last night. It was unclear whether this was because of illness or the prospect of progress in the negotiations, which now are focused on the Vance-Owen plan to divide the country into 10 semi-autonomous provinces. Mr Mate Boban and Mr Mile Akmadzic, the Bosnian Croat leaders, took part in yesterday's meeting but there was again no face-to-face contact with Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader. However, a UN spokesman said Mr Vance and Lord Owen hoped to meet him today. He too had been expected to leave New York last night but apparently agreed to remain after reports circulated that he might be isolated as the only leader to hold out on the division plan, assuming Mr Izetbegovic eventually agreed. In New York, Bosnia's UN ambassador, Mr Muhamed Sacirbey, dampened expectations that the Moslems were on the point of signing the agreement on dividing Bosnia-Hercegovina, following their approval of ceasefire and military disengagement arrangements on Wednesday. Countering forecasts by the mediators that there would be a breakthrough on the plan, which has so far been signed only by the Bosnian Croats, Mr Sacirbey said his government still had strong concerns. In particular, further clarification was needed on how power would be shared between the proposed provinces and the central government, which would be responsible for foreign relations. The Bosnian Serbs, who have been assigned 43 per cent of Bosnia's territory, compared with the 70 per cent they now occupy, also have reservations about the proposed map. This is the most controversial element of the three-part peace plan, which also includes a constitutional framework and a military agreement. Meanwhile, the French commander of UN troops in Bosnia set out to cross Serb battle lines in an armoured convoy to assess the plight of the Moslem settlement of Cerska. The UN had been unable to persuade Bosnian Serb commanders to allow aid workers into Cerska, reportedly overrun by Serb forces. General Philippe Morillon was last night reported to be negotiating with Serb commanders. Unconfirmed reports from amateur radio operators, the only source of information from the besieged area and nearby Konjevic Polje, have said that hundreds of people have been killed and thousands were fleeing the region. Radio Sarajevo carried an appeal from Cerska's local leaders to Mr Clinton to rescue them. 'How long can this go on? The world watches and does nothing,' the appeal said. In Sarajevo a convoy carrying aid sent jointly by Serb Catholic and Moslem charities was hit by grenades, injuring four drivers. Bosnian Serbs blamed Moslem forces and ordered a halt to aid convoys while talks were held with the UN to guarantee their safety. Elsewhere heavy snowfalls stranded more than 50 UN aid trucks on narrow mountain roads in Bosnia. The commander of UN troops in former Yugoslavia for the past year acknowledged yesterday that there was widespread dissatisfaction with their current mandate, saying this would have to be changed. Lieutenant General Satish Nambiar, who is returning to Indian army service, agreed with the view that the peacekeepers might have to be authorised to use force to implement a peace settlement. Gen Nambiar emphasised that all the heavy weapons now in the possession of the warring groups would have to be brought under UN control to make a ceasefire effective.

The banned Ulster Freedom Fighters, one of the Protestant groups involved in a wave of sectarian shootings, said it was not prepared to sit down with Mr Seamus Mallon, the deputy leader of the predominantly Catholic SDLP and MP for Newry and Armagh. Mr Mallon had challenged loyalist gunmen to meet him after the Ulster Volunteer Force claimed responsibility for the first serious terrorist attack of 1993 - the murders of a Catholic father and son near Dungannon, Co Tyrone.

0,FT943-3205 ,"FT943-3205 _AN-EIOC7AC8FT 940915   FT  15 SEP 94 / Survey of Northern Ireland (2): A puzzle for the economists  -Prolonged peace could bring a 'peace dividend' - or, some warn, a 'peace deficit' / The Northern Irish economy is recovering faster than the British economy as a whole      By JOHN MCMANUS   It is probably not surprising that peace should be as divisive amongst Northern Ireland's economists as 25 years of violence has been amongst the population at large. The 'issue' in Northern Irish economic circles at the moment is the impact on the economy of a prolonged, hopefully indefinite, period of peace. It is best summed up by the question: 'Is there going to be a peace dividend or a peace deficit?' There are some facts about the situation accepted by both sides in the debate, including the fact that the Northern Irish economy has been buffered from the worst of the recent recession by a Pounds 3bn to Pounds 4bn a year subsidy from the British Exchequer. It is also accepted that the Northern Irish economy is recovering faster than the British economy as a whole. This is particularly obvious in key measures such as Northern Irish production output and manufacturing industries output, which, on an indexed basis, have been ahead of Britain since mid-1990. Although unemployment in Northern Ireland remains the highest in Britain, at just under 13 per cent, employment has remained stable since 1990, despite a significant decline in Britain. In fact, looking back, it is debatable whether Northern Ireland had a recession at all. If you take a decline in GDP over two successive quarters as a definition of a recession, then it definitely did not have one. However, what economists do not agree on is that peace will benefit the economy and support the recovery. Dr Graham Gudgin of the Northern Ireland Economic Research Centre is one of the doubters - 'security-related expenditure accounts for about one third of the Pounds 4bn annual subvention . . . there is a huge question mark as to whether the north would be allowed to keep that money if peace broke out.' The possible benefits to the Northern Irish economy of increased tourism and other aspects of peace, would not outweigh the effect of losing the subsidy, he believes. Up to 20,000 well-paid jobs in the security forces and related areas could be lost, predicts Dr Gudgin. The type of jobs that are supposed to replace them, particularly in areas such as tourism, will be relatively low-paid, he points out. The government, not surprisingly, is much more positive and the Minister of State at Northern Ireland's Department of Economic Development, Mr Tim Smith, has cited unpublished research showing that 'over a number of years' the net effect of peace will beneficial in job terms. A similar stance has been taken by the Confederation of British Industry in Northern Ireland, which estimates that job growth through inward investment will quadruple from about 500 per year to 2,000 over a two-to-three year period, while perhaps another 70,000 jobs will be created in the tourism industry. One economist who is very positive about the impact of peace is Mr Douglas Hamilton, who works with the Government policy advisory group, the Northern Ireland Economic Council. Mr Hamilton believes there would be a tremendous boost to industry from operating in an environment not tempered by a political climate of violence and conflict. 'The troubles did not really lead to companies pulling out, but to a situation where they do not operate under normal conditions,' he claims. Mr Hamilton also believes that there would be pressure on the British government to let the Northern Irish economy down gently, by phasing-out the payment gradually and creating a reconstruction or redevelopment fund. Although the British government has not committed itself to such a fund, there have already been suggestions of increased aid from the United States and the European Union. The US is considering donating up to Dollars 150m over two to three years through the International Fund for Ireland. The fund was established by the British and Irish governments in 1986 and raises money in North America and Europe for projects that encourage reconciliation and economic regeneration. The president of the European Commission, Mr Jacques Delors, has said the European Union may increase the size of the donation it makes to the International Fund. There will be fundamental changes in the Northern Irish economy, which has many structural weaknesses, if peace becomes permanent, believes Mr Hamilton. Paradoxically, it was the structural weakness that led to the admirable performance of the Northern Irish economy during the recent recession, according to Mr Hamilton. The under-developed nature of Northern Ireland's financial services industry and the dynamics of its property market, with no appreciable shortage of private sector housing, meant that the boom in personal credit that led to the British recession, bypassed Northern Ireland. The absence of speculative pressure on house prices meant that people in Northern Ireland had nothing like the level of personal debt that people in the South of England had when high interest rates hit at the end of the 1980s. The distorted nature of Northern Ireland's employment patterns, with the government employing roughly 200,000 out of a total workforce of about 800,000, had a strong buffering effect also, explains Mr Hamilton. In addition, the exceptionally high level of grants that have been available in Northern Ireland since the start of the troubles - up to 40 per cent of capital expenditure - meant that Northern Irish companies went into recessions very well capitalised and with less debt than most British competitors. The strong performance of Northern Ireland's manufacturing industry is not merely accidental, points out Mr Gudgin. As a sector, it is less dependent on the British market than most companies in the UK. Sales to Britain only account for one third of output, compared to two thirds for most British industry. In addition, wage levels in Northern Ireland have fallen by about 10 per cent below British levels in the last ten years, due mostly to unemployment and the end of collective wage bargaining, says Dr Gudgin. One area in which Dr Gudgin and Mr Hamilton do concur is in their caution when it comes to predictions for the Northern Irish economy. In the absence of any appreciable peace dividend, both economists find it hard to accept that the North will out-perform Britain in the long term. 'Northern Ireland follows the British cycle,' explains Dr Gudgin, but he adds: 'If wage advantage and other advantages can be maintained, there is evidence that there will be something of a long-term improvement in the competitive position.'

0,FT933-7683 ,"FT933-7683 _AN-DHTCQABCFT 930820   FT  20 AUG 93 / Israel writhes under the goad of Hizbollah: Armed conflict risks overtaking diplomatic peace efforts      By JULIAN OZANNE      JERUSALEM   ISRAEL'S problems in southern Lebanon refuse to go away. Just as the Jewish state was congratulating itself on last month's devastating seven-day offensive against Lebanese civilians, intended to curb attacks by the pro-Iranian Hizbollah militia, an increase in regional violence is back on the agenda. The death of at least eight Israeli soldiers in southern Lebanon yesterday in two Hizbollah attacks, the first of which was followed by immediate retaliatory strikes by Israeli aircraft, has underlined the continuing fragility of the region. It has also raised the prospect of armed conflict overtaking diplomatic peace efforts and re-opened the fault lines between Israelis who argue for a more intensive peace drive and those calling for tougher military measures. Once again violence in southern Lebanon is driving Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, to weigh up (for the second time in a month) whether to pursue the diplomatic track or risk scuttling peace talks by more serious military action. Suspicions that Syria, the main power-broker in Lebanon and the arms conduit to Hizbollah, tacitly allowed yesterday's attacks have also dented Israeli hopes of a real change in relations with Damascus. Israelis point out that yesterday's attacks came after Syria reprimanded the Lebanese government for deploying troops in southern Lebanon - a move which could have restricted Hizbollah activities. For 15 years, Israel, in defiance of UN resolutions, has been trying to 'purge' Lebanon of hostile Arab guerrillas. Today that goal is as elusive as it was when Israeli soldiers first crossed in substantial force into Lebanese territory in 1978, and later, in 1982, marched all the way to Beirut. Indeed, many Israeli military experts believe the country is now facing its most effective enemy in Hizbollah, which took over resistance to Israel after most Palestinian guerrillas were forced to flee Lebanon during the 1982 Israeli invasion. This year alone there have been more than 600 attacks on the self-styled Israeli 'security zone' in southern Lebanon. Yesterday's incidents brought the casualties for 1993 to at least 17 soldiers killed and 31 wounded. Furthermore, Israeli military analysts say the highly mobile Hizbollah is much better armed this year, with Iranian supplied Sagger anti-tank missiles and Strela shoulder-mounted anti-aircraft missiles. With the assistance of Iranian officers, it is also better trained. The Israeli public has come to expect revenge attacks and the pressures for serious military action is especially intense given that the government has been telling the public that last month's offensive, in which 130 Lebanese were killed, was a decisive blow against Hizbollah. Mr Rabin, a former army chief who embodies the belief that diplomacy must be backed by force, will also come under intense lobbying from military hardliners and Israeli hawks led by Mr Ariel Sharon, the former defence minister responsible for the disastrous 1982 invasion. Mr Sharon has called for an expansion of the security zone by the creation of a 'supplementary zone' between the Litani and Awali rivers where Israeli troops and their Lebanese proxies would have freedom of action without maintaining a military presence. 'Villages in the zone which have concealed terrorists for years should no longer be left standing,' he wrote recently. Few Israelis back Mr Sharon's military adventurism. Most fear being sucked into another Lebanese quagmire like the 1982-85 campaign, where 654 Israeli soldiers died and thousands were wounded. But many also believe that Israeli aerial and artillery retaliation leave the underlying problems unsolved. Some hardliners, therefore, see an answer to the problems in suspending peace talks with Syria. 'More Israeli retaliation is futile. We should tell Syria to go to hell,' said Brig Gen (Res) Aharon Levran, former deputy head of military intelligence. 'Hizbollah is a whip in Syrian hands to hurt Israel and we should not talk peace with them any more. The problem is that this government wants peace at any price. They want to put their names in the annals of history and they don't give a damm about the true and cruel realities.' However, a majority of the government and the public still recognise that only a comprehensive Middle East peace deal will solve Israel's problems in southern Lebanon. 'We must prevent ourselves being tempted into deeper military involvement in Lebanon or we will have casualties like this every day,' said Mr Ran Cohen, an MP from the left-wing Meretz party. 'Military action will not stop the violence; only a peace agreement will stop it. This is the only way.' Attacks by Hizbollah, combined with suspicions of Syria, weaken the voices of reason and moderation in Israel and threaten wider conflict. But the lesson of Israel's actions in Lebanon in the 1970s and 1980s is apparent to all but the most diehard Israelis: that violence is no substitute for genuine negotiation. Israelis who are seriously committed to peace hope the same message is understood in Syria.   Countries:-  ILZ  Israel, Middle East.     LBZ  Lebanon, Middle East.

The resurgence of violence came a day after Syria, the main power-broker in Lebanon, warned the Beirut government against taking independent action in southern Lebanon, such as the recent decision to deploy Lebanese soldiers in the area. The pro-Iranian Hizbollah, which constitutes the backbone of the Lebanese 'resistance' to the Israeli control of a self-declared security zone in southern Lebanon, has vowed to continue attacks despite an informal ceasefire agreement brokered last month by Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state. Israel has said it will respond harshly to any new attacks on its forces. A further escalation in violence is expected in the run-up to the eleventh round of Middle East peace talks, due in two weeks in Washington, which Hizbollah opposes. Syria, which could exert its influence to curb Hizbollah attacks, has sent conflicting signals about peace with Israel and the role of Hizbollah, which it continues to use as leverage against the Jewish state. Last month, during Mr Christopher's visit to the region, President Hafez al-Assad bolstered Israeli hopes of a breakthrough in bilateral peace talks by sending a series of messages to Jerusalem. However, the Syrian leader has refused to completely halt Hizbollah's activities and has strongly criticised the Lebanese government's troop deployment, which was scaled down when Damascus expressed reservations. Meanwhile, the Palestine Liberation Organisation said yesterday it would - for the first time - appoint some Palestinian negotiators from the Israeli-occupied territories to its highest decision-making bodies. The PLO, ruling out prospects for progress in the next peace talks, made the move as part of its continuing strategy to force Israel to open a direct dialogue with the organisation as the only way to unblock the peace process.

How can such acts of violence be  prevented?    [Al-Tibi] Only by implementing the peace agreement. Even  though things will not become completely peaceful then, the acts  of violence will at least be reduced.    [Albrecht] Yesterday, it seemed that the peace negotiations  would be continued now. Is this still true?    [Al-Tibi] The PLO Executive Committee is currently  discussing how things are going to continue after the latest  crime.    [Albrecht] You call it a crime.    [Al-Tibi] Yes, it is a crime. It is just a continuation of  the Hebron massacre. First, Baruch Goldstein shot 30 people.  Then, during the following eight days, the Israeli military  shot 30 Palestinians. And now another six Palestinians were  killed. It will be very difficult to continue the peace talks  this week.    [Albrecht] What is your demand to the Israelis?    [Al-Tibi] They should stop killing us. They should make  sure that the atmosphere changes and they finally see us as  human beings.    [Albrecht] Do you trust Rabin, who is defense minister and  prime minister at the same time?    [Al-Tibi] Defense Minister Rabin is hurting the peace  efforts of Prime Minister Rabin.    [Albrecht] How, do you think, did this most recent shooting  of Palestinians come about?    [Al-Tibi] The only reason that can be behind that is that  there was an order to stage a massacre. If the Israeli military  goes to the refugee camps, it does so only for one specific  reason. In addition, these soldiers were not normal military.  They were a special unit that went in to shoot people. Who  gave the order to go to the refugee camp one day before the  continuation of the talks?    [Albrecht] A few days ago you were still optimistic about  the peace process. You spoke of ""historic changes"" and of the  ""mutual recognition of the two peoples.""    [Al-Tibi] Yes, I was naively optimistic.    [Albrecht] Why?    [Al-Tibi] Because we were very close to an interim solution  after the massacre in Hebron. Nevertheless, I am sure that, in  the end, we will implement the peace agreement.    [Albrecht] The trust of the Palestinians in their leadership  is constantly decreasing. While the leadership wants to  continue the peace talks, the people at the grassroots demand  not to continue negotiations.    [Al-Tibi] Yes, I just had a telephone call from Gaza. I was  asked to tell 'Arafat that he should stop the peace talks.  However, there is no alternative to the peace process. Of  course, our credibility has suffered. The Palestinians still do  not see any change or improvement. I am sure that at the moment  when the agreement comes into force and when the Palestinians  see that the Israeli military withdraws, the support for peace  will be there again. I know my people.

0,FT934-5717 ,"FT934-5717 _AN-DK2DYAA5FT 931129   FT  29 NOV 93 / Abortive initiatives go back more than 20 years      By RICHARD DONKIN   The history of the IRA's campaign against the British government is littered with abandoned initiatives and meetings between serving politicians and republican leaders. Discussions since the early 1970s have been veiled in secrecy because of the sensitivity of both the unionists and successive Irish governments. Lord Wilson, when leader of the Labour opposition, met IRA leaders in Dublin in 1971 and again the next year in England. The first meeting was described as an 'act of treachery' by Dr Garret FitzGerald, the then Irish president, and a 'waffling session' by Mr Joe Cahill, one of the IRA leaders present. The most direct formal talks between a government and republicans came in June 1972 when Lord Whitelaw, as secretary of state for Northern Ireland, held secret and abortive talks to try to arrange a ceasefire with a group of six republican leaders in London. The republicans, including Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president who had been interned in Long Kesh, and Mr Martin McGuinness, his deputy, were flown out of Belfast by the RAF and escorted in great secrecy to the Chelsea house of Mr Paul Channon, Whitelaw's junior minister. The IRA team, led by Mr Sean MacStiofain, the then Provisionals' chief-of-staff, demanded the right to national self-determination for the Irish people as a whole, a declaration by the government to withdraw troops within 2 1/2 years and an amnesty for political prisoners. Lord Whitelaw declared afterwards in his memoirs that the meeting was a 'non-event'. He wrote: 'The IRA leaders simply made impossible demands which I told them the British government would never concede. They were in fact still in a mood of defiance and determination to carry on until their absurd ultimatums were met.' Mr McGuinness admitted that his team had concluded they had not reached a position at that time where they could do 'serious business' with the British government. During 1974 and 1975, under the then Labour government, senior officials regularly met Sinn Fein leaders at Laneside, a large government-owned house to the east of Belfast. These meetings, authorised by Mr Merlyn Rees, then Northern Ireland secretary, helped establish local channels of communication with the IRA in Belfast, used to discuss arrangements for the ceasefire of 1975. Other, less formal contacts, have been established from time to time. Mr Douglas Hurd, now foreign secretary, was a frontbench spokesman on European affairs when he met Mr Adams and Mr Danny Morrison of Sinn Fein in Belfast in 1978. Mr Hurd stressed that he was acting as an individual. Informal and formal meetings alike have generally caused unease in the Irish republic. Dr Garret FitzGerald, the former Irish prime minister, said in his memoirs: 'The contacts that had taken place had had the effect merely of prolonging violence by deluding the IRA into believing that a British government would eventually negotiate a settlement with them.'

Could such a thing be  acceptable to Israel?    [Beilin] Look, I cannot get into detail. Someone has taken  something out of context or made something up. There will be  many such reports. I think that what is important is that U.S.  shuttle diplomacy is working and I very much hope that it will  continue at an accelerated pace. If it does not continue I see  no possibility of reaching an agreement because the Syrians  refuse to hold Oslo or Camp David style talks with us. If  things continue at the present pace, then I believe agreement is  possible and then all these details will be explained in the  course of negotiations.    [Ben-Menahem] But there are five Syrian conditions. What is  Israel's reaction to these conditions?    [Beilin] Look, I do not want to discuss the actual  negotiations. Although everything is very public, it is very  important to keep the details secret because negotiations become  impossible once everything becomes public. The five conditions  published in AL-HAYAH apparently are not really Syria's  conditions, and I would not like to juxtapose Israel's stands  against some newspaper leak -- whether accurate or not -- of the  Syrian position.    [Ben-Menahem] Why hold these shuttle trips? Why not  establish a secret negotiating track as we did in Oslo?    [Beilin] Because the Syrians refuse to do so. That is the  only reason. I think that if one wants to hold serious  negotiations it is very important to keep things secret. Then  you do not have media or psychological pressures on either side.  Nor must one point to a breakthrough in every single round of  talks. To my great regret, the Syrians refuse to make such a  move. If I had to choose between not holding negotiations at  all or having these shuttle missions by U.S. officials in  parallel with the bilateral negotiations in Washington, then I  think we have to accept the continuation of U.S. diplomacy.    [Ganor] You keep stressing the U.S. role, especially that of  the secretary of state in these shuttle missions. What should  Warren Christopher do now in order to put the Syrian-Israeli  negotiations on a more practical track?    [Beilin] This decision is a matter of great importance. Out  of more than 70 international conflicts, this is one with a  better chance for resolution. He should be here more often, he  should travel between Damascus and Jerusalem. If this is done,  I am sure that we shall reach a solution because, in my opinion,  the major problems have already been resolved now that the  Syrians have finally expressed their readiness to talk about  peace with Israel and Israel is finally prepared after quite a  few years to speak of withdrawal with regard to the Golan  Heights.    [Ganor] Do you expect the secretary of state to visit the  region more frequently?    [Beilin] I would very much hope that these visits not always  come at the tail end of other visits. In other words, as some  kind of way to cap other visits to Europe or Turkey. I think it  is important that the Americans consider this a central foreign  policy issue. Something they can start work on and resolve.    [Ben-Menahem] There were reports this week that Christopher  applied some sort of pressure on Syrian President al-Asad. Do  you really think the Americans can pressure Syria in a way that  can accelerate the process?    [Beilin] Look, the question is how you define pressure.  According to the reports and I have received no confirmation of  them -- he simply told the Syrians that if they could not answer  his questions he would wash his hands of the matter. The only  U.S. pressure I can discern here is a lack of involvement in the  process. They did not threaten to stop helping some party or to  harm someone else. I do not particularly believe in this theory  of U.S. pressure. In Oslo, we proved that we could reach a very  interesting and far-reaching agreement without any U.S.  involvement, and I also think there is no need for any U.S.  pressure either on Syria or on Israel. I think that what is  needed is for the United States to devote time to this issue,  because without the Americans there will be no peace with Syria.  [passage omitted]    [Ben-Menahem] Mr. Beilin, you have voiced great  expectations from Christopher's shuttle missions. Do you still  believe that peace with Syria is attainable in 1994?    [Beilin] It all depends on the rate of progress. If things  are accelerated, many rounds of talks will be held, and we will  be able to exchange views with the Syrians. Then I think that  peace will be achievable in 1994. If, on the other hand, the  meetings and visits by U.S. officials come every two months then  we can simply forget about it.    [Ganor] What must first happen in order to realize your more  optimistic assessment?    [Beilin] What I am saying is quite simple and based on my  own personal experience from the talks with the Jordanians and  Palestinians six, seven, and eight years ago. When the  negotiations were not direct but rather conducted through the  Americans we were totally dependent on their tempo. When the  Americans could afford to devote a lot of time to the politics  of the region, things made very rapid progress. If you recall,  there were the 10 points with Jordan in 1986 and other things  that the Americans -- at the time Richard Murphy was especially  involved in the political process -- pushed very quickly.  Whenever they were forced to devote their attention to other  matters, the peace process ground to a halt. I must admit that  there is an unpleasant dependency on the United States. We must  fight for an important place on the U.S. agenda. The more time  Washington devotes to the Middle East, the greater the chances  of peace.    [Ganor] Nevertheless, Mr. Beilin, if Jerusalem declares that  it is prepared to withdraw from the Golan Heights, then progress  can be made, at least from the Syrian point of view.    [Beilin] First of all, I am not sure. I do not know. Do  you believe we will rapidly establish peace if we make such a  declaration tomorrow? I would not bet on it. So far, I have  found some elements of Syria's policy quite baffling. The fact  is that up to this very moment, Syria has not fully detailed its  concept of the nature of peace and whether it includes  diplomatic and economic relations, open borders, and so forth.  I, however, do not believe we shall issue such a declaration.  Our declaration that the depth of withdrawal on the Golan  Heights will correspond to the depth of peace with Syria is the  most far-reaching and comprehensive statement that Israel can  make before launching negotiations. I am not proposing that  Syria and Israel accept the other party's position before the  negotiations start.    [Ganor] But you are not ruling out the possibility that  Jerusalem may declare its readiness to relinquish the Golan  Heights in the course of the negotiations?    [Beilin] I hope this will not be the case. I hope we can  reach an arrangement with Syria while giving up as little as  possible of the Golan Heights. At any rate, whatever agreement  is eventually reached will have to be brought before the people  in a national referendum and the people will decide whether they  are willing to pay the price for peace with Syria, which by  definition will not be an easy one, or actually to pay the price  for a comprehensive peace in the Middle East because currently  the Syrians are the most problematic element in the Arab world  vis a vis Israel. An agreement with them means diplomatic  relations with Lebanon, Jordan, the Gulf states and most of the  Maghreb countries. [passage omitted]     "

The agreement was being treated with caution because several ceasefire accords have collapsed since the war erupted nearly a year ago. But it was considered of more than usual significance because the negotiations had taken place under the aegis of President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia. Bosnian Serb commander General Ratko Mladic last night said he had agreed to a general ceasefire and would today allow a relief convoy to enter Srebrenica, the most vulnerable Moslem enclave in eastern Bosnia. The agreement was reached after a five-hour meeting in Belgrade with General Lars Erik Wahlgren, the commander of UN forces in the former Yugoslavia, and General Philippe Morillon, the commander of UN forces in Bosnia. Gen Morillon said Bosnian Moslem vice-president Ejup Ganic and Croat leader Mate Boban had also agreed to the ceasefire. 'They gave their agreement to give the same directive to their own forces,' he said. The decision to hold yesterday's talks was made at the urging of President Milosevic in a meeting with Gen Morillon on Thursday. Gen Wahlgren said that Gen Mladic had authorised the departure today of a 20-truck UN aid convoy to the besieged town of Srebrenica. The convoy, currently blocked by Serb militiamen at the Serbian border town of Mali Zvornik, will evacuate civilians from Srebrenica. The announcement of the ceasefire was made as Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, arrived in Belgrade from New York. He immediately threatened to pull out of the peace talks on Bosnia, chaired by international mediators Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen. Mr Karadzic, who on Thursday refused to follow President Alijah Izetbegovic of Bosnia in signing the map of the semi-autonomous provinces into which Bosnia would be divided under the proposed settlement, was sceptical about the ceasefire agreement concluded by his own army commander. Mr Karadzic yesterday came under growing pressure from the international community to sign the peace accord when President Bill Clinton said the US would give Serbia a few days to sign before considering more stringent actions to pressure Belgrade. He said talks would be held with America's allies on the possible lifting of an international arms embargo against the combatants in the former Yugoslavia, a move that would aid embattled Moslems in Bosnia.

0,FT911-609 ,"FT911-609 _AN-BEJAXAFUFT 910510   FT  10 MAY 91 / Soviet minister issues strong criticism of Jewish settlements      By HUGH CARNEGY      JERUSALEM   STRONG criticism of Jewish settlement in the occupied Arab territories came yesterday from Mr Alexander Bessmertnykh, the Soviet foreign minister. He said a US-Soviet sponsored Middle East peace conference could not go ahead before the issue was confronted. His comments came on the day Mr Yitzhak Shamir, Israel's prime minister, said the Soviet Union had to renew full diplomatic relations with Israel before assuming a role in Middle East peace talks. He said renewed diplomatic relations were 'a prior condition for the Soviet Union's participation in the peace process, and we will welcome it'. Mr Bessmertnykh, speaking in Jordan in advance of a ground-breaking visit to Israel today, said Moscow did not accept any pre-conditions for its participation in the process. He also linked the settlements issue to Soviet Jewish emigration to Israel. Asked whether Moscow planned to restrict the outflow, he said: 'I do not exclude anything when we talk about the necessity to stop the construction of these settlements.' Mr Bessmertnykh damped hopes that his Jerusalem visit, the first by a Soviet foreign minister, would bring an announcement of the re-establishment of full diplomatic relations between the two countries after a 24-year rift. 'We do not accept any conditions for our own participation in the peace process in the Middle East because our role in that process is natural.' Speaking after talks with Jordan's King Hussein, the foreign minister said he could not 'foresee, conceive or accept' holding a peace conference while settlement building continued in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. 'The Soviet Union and other countries who are interested in arranging such a conference are going to deal with that problem straightforwardly and directly as one of the things to be solved before the conference starts.' Mr Bessmertnykh's six-hour visit to Israel is part of a Middle East shuttle that will complement the fourth tour through the region by Mr James Baker, the US secretary of state, since the end of the Gulf war. Mr Baker is trying to bring about a regional conference that would open the way to bilateral Arab-Israeli peace talks. The two men are scheduled to meet in Cairo at the weekend. During his first two stops in Jordan and Syria - Moscow's long-standing ally in the Middle East - Mr Bessmertnykh reiterated continued Soviet support for the Arab stance and the Palestine Liberation Organisation. In spite of his criticism of Israel he was careful to stress Moscow backed Washington's efforts. Perhaps significantly, an expected meeting in Amman with Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO leader - who Washington and Israel want excluded from the process - did not take place. Apart from the issue of settlements, which the Israeli government has flatly refused to halt, Mr Bessmertnykh's talks with Mr Shamir will focus on the Moscow-backed Arab demand that the proposed conference should include the UN and be more than a one-time formal opening to a series of bilateral negotiations. Israel wants to exclude the UN, which it regards as biased, and rejects any executive role for the full conference largely for the same reason. Mr Shamir, who believes Moscow has decided in principle to restore full relations regardless of hesitation over timing, will urge Mr Bessmertnykh to distance Moscow from the PLO and persuade Syria in particular to soften its conditions for talks.

Tempers became so frayed that at one point Mr Major banged the  declaration down on the table in front of him. But officials  fiercely denied Dr Paisley's claim that Mr Major was ""throwing  papers around.""    It was the kind of rowdy setback to the Downing Street  declaration that everyone expected. In fact, some observers  were astonished that the meeting ran its full 30 minute course.  They assumed Dr Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionists,  would have stormed out within the first few minutes.    And there was plainly no prospect that the Prime Minister  could influence Dr Paisley's implacable stand against the  declaration and the peace process, which he had already  denounced as ""a sham and a deceit.""    The meeting was destined to be a shouting match from the  moment Dr Paisley, and his colleagues, Peter Robinson and  William McCrea, strode into the Prime Minister's study. It was  the first ""formal"" meeting between Mr Major and Dr Paisley since  the declaration was proclaimed on December 15.    The versions of the stormy encounter from Downing Street and  from Dr Paisley did not tally in all respects -- but what was  clear from both accounts was that this was the biggest row  Downing Street has seen for years. Their reports left the  impression that Dr Paisley was roaring like a bull -- and that  the Prime Minister's own voice was more than once untypically  raised in anger. Although this was not the sort of  confrontation the Prime Minister relishes, there is a widespread  feeling that he was well-prepared for an onslaught. It will  make not the slightest difference to his faith in the  Declaration.    In other developments today:     -  Northern Ireland Secretary,  Sir Patrick Mayhew, repeated there could be no negotiations in  return for a temporary IRA ceasefire;    -  Foreign Secretary Douglas  Hurd, speaking in Dublin, underlined that all-party talks on the  Province's future still offered the best path to peace, despite  the Unionist threat to boycott any new discussions.    But the Downing Street row dominated. Afterwards, Dr Paisley  said that Mr Major was ""very, very angry.""    ""It was a very rough meeting. I have never seen the Prime  Minister more angry. I had to raise my voice in order that the  Prime Minister could hear because he was shouting so loudly,"" he  said.    Dr Paisley said he urged Mr Major to abandon the declaration  and made clear he would make it the main issue at the  Euro-elections in June. The Prime Minister, he said, was  ""throwing papers around -- he must have thrown them around three  or four times or more.""    ""We served notice on him that we were seeking a mandate from  the people of Northern Ireland against the joint declaration in  June,"" said Dr Paisley. ""He said he wanted to have peace. We  told him that you don't have peace with surrender. He was very,  very angry. He refused even to listen to the points we were  making. He abandoned the meeting and said we would have to meet  again.""    Dr Paisley described the declaration as ""a rotten, sinking  vessel which is going down now in confusion.""    Junior Northern Ireland minister Michael Ancram confirmed  that the meeting was ""very frank"" and Mr Major made his views  known ""forcibly."" He added: ""The Prime Minister took Mr Paisley  to task for misrepresenting the declaration on a number of  occasions.""    Downing Street said Dr Paisley handed over a submission, ""a  printed piece of paper about his view of things."" Officials  said he denounced the declaration as ""iniquitous"" and utterly  rejected it as a ""farce"" -- a description the Prime Minister  called ""rubbish.""    And as Dr Paisley continued to condemn the declaration, the  Prime Minister took the opportunity to point out that he had a  mandate from the people of the United Kingdom. Mr Major said  they wanted all the constitutional parties to take part in the  talks.    Dr Paisley and Mr Robinson continued expressing their  hostility to the declaration ""in rather loud terms.""    The Prime Minister said he had been very patient with Dr  Paisley but had had enough of listening to his misrepresentation  of the declaration. ""Dr Paisley continued to misrepresent the  declaration and Mr Robinson then accused the Prime Minister of  giving way to violence. The Prime Minister retorted by saying  how could he justify that statement when the Government  maintained nearly 20,000 troops in Northern Ireland.""    Mr Major was said to have been ""very calm, very firm,  extremely tough and vigorous."" But officials afterwards claimed  it was probably salutary that Dr Paisley had been given a  ""correct interpretation"" of the declaration.    Mr Hurd, said after hour-long talks in Dublin with Irish  Foreign Minister Dick Spring that fresh talks were ""the only way  in which progress was going to be likely."" He said: ""We all  know this is a difficult path and that it will not be easy.  That has been proved over and over again. But the status  quo...is not acceptable either. We all have a duty to find ways  of making progress. And we -- the two governments -- believe  the talks offer the best way. So we intend to pursue that path.""    Mr Hurd said the peace declaration was not a ""bargaining  offer.""    And Sir Patrick repeated that there could be no negotiations  in return for a temporary IRA ceasefire. A temporary ceasefire  carried the risk that the terrorists would start their campaign  again, he said in Newcastle, Co [County] Down.     "
0,FT934-12907 ,"FT934-12907 _AN-DJYCQAAIFT 931025   FT  25 OCT 93 / Bomb puts Ulster peace talks in doubt      By PHILIP STEPHENS and Our Belfast Correspondent   THE Hume-Adams initiative to end the fighting in Northern Ireland appeared doomed last night as Mr John Major led a fierce denunciation of the IRA's bombing of a busy Belfast street. As the death toll from Saturday's attack in the Protestant Shankill Road rose to 10, including one of the terrorists who planted the bomb, Mr Major ruled out early dialogue with the Republican Sinn Fein movement. Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, and Mr Dick Spring, Ireland's foreign affairs minister, announced they had postponed a meeting of the Anglo-Irish inter-governmental conference on Wednesday. Mr Spring had been expected at that meeting to pass on to Sir Patrick details of the Hume-Adams plan. Sir Patrick is expected to make a House of Commons statement later today. British ministers expect that the London and Dublin governments will now press ahead with their own efforts to devise a new constitutional settlement to provide an umbrella for fresh talks between the legitimate political parties in the province. In the wake of Saturday's massacre Ulster Unionists demanded an end to the so-called peace initiative framed by Mr John Hume, leader of the nationalist Social Democratic Labour party, and Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president. Mr Hume called on the two governments to speed up their consideration of the proposals, which he said offered the best hope in 20 years of ending sectarian violence in the province. However, Mr Major, who is expected to hold talks with Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, during Friday's European Community summit in Brussels, said the bombing had seriously undermined hopes for dialogue. Speaking at the Commonwealth summit in Cyprus, Mr Major said he wanted one message from the IRA: 'We have given up violence for good.' He added: 'The message I want to hear is quite clear. It is quite simple. But I haven't heard it yet.' Apparently dismissing the Hume-Adams proposals, the prime minister said: 'I have read about it, I have heard about it, but I have not seen it.' Senior ministers added the bombing had reduced to 'practically zero' the already slim prospect that Mr Hume's efforts could lead to participation by Sinn Fein in talks to secure a political settlement in Ulster. One member of the cabinet said the government would be accused - and rightly so - of bowing to the terrorists if it opened contacts with an organisation which explicitly supported IRA terrorism. Mr Reynolds said the bombing was another atrocity which showed that the path of violence led nowhere. He said: 'All sides, even at this late stage, must desist from killing and allow the dialogue to develop between those who believe in peace.' Mr Adams said last night that the bombing had been 'wrong' after the IRA indicated that it had intended to give a warning before the bomb was detonated, but that it had exploded prematurely.

AFRICA: ANC LEADER SAYS THE GOVERNMENT IS UNWILLING TO ACT TO END BLACK  FACTIONAL VIOLENCE. HE WARNS OF POSSIBLE RETURN TO ARMED STRUGGLE.      By SCOTT KRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER      JOHANNESBURG, South Africa      As black factional fighting flared again near Johannesburg, Nelson Mandela met  President Frederik W. de Klerk on Tuesday and later declared the peace process  imperiled by government reluctance to move swiftly to end the township carnage.    ""It is dragging its feet, (and) the peace process is definitely threatened,""  Mandela told reporters after leading a 22-person African National Congress  delegation in three-hour talks with De Klerk in Pretoria.    Mandela added that the ANC might be forced by its supporters to consider a  return to the 29-year-old armed liberation struggle, which it formally  suspended last month.    ""If the government fails to take action, if violence continues to rise and the  people continue to demand to be armed, we will find it difficult to oppose that  demand, and, of course, the consequences would be very clear to everybody,""  Mandela said.    The fighting between factions, which pits mostly migrant Zulu workers from  Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom Party against Xhosas and other  supporters of Mandela's ANC, has thus far claimed nearly 700 lives in townships  surrounding Johannesburg since late July.    It appears to echo the three-year-old internecine war in the eastern province  of Natal, Buthelezi's home base. Battles between Zulu followers of Inkatha and  Zulu followers of the ANC have claimed nearly 4,000 lives in Natal.    Although both Mandela and De Klerk renewed their commitment to the process of a  peaceful, negotiated end to black oppression on Tuesday, they remained at odds  over the cause of the violence near Johannesburg and in Natal.    Top-level government officials delivered a rare public criticism of Mandela  this week, and chief government negotiator Gerrit Viljoen said that the ANC  ""must cease claiming total innocence for themselves and their followers, and  laying blame on their opponents, or the police.""    The ANC, the largest and most influential black political group in the country,  has accused the police of siding with Inkatha, a charge that the police deny.  Numerous accounts of witnesses to the violence in Johannesburg-area townships  suggest that some policemen may be assisting Inkatha against the ANC, the  government's old enemy.    On Tuesday, at least 24 people were hacked, shot or burned to death in battles  between migrant Zulus and township residents in Katlehong, Vosloorus and Tokoza  townships southeast of Johannesburg. Police officers and troops under white  commanders exchanged gunfire with black combatants in the townships, police  said.    Mandela has claimed that elements of the police who oppose De Klerk's peace  initiatives are stoking the black fighting to subvert the peace process.    ""I wish to state very clearly and very emphatically the government has the  capacity to put an end to this violence if it wants to, and I want them to use  that capacity,"" Mandela said Tuesday.    ""The amount of casualties suffered by our people and the failure of action by  the government threatens the peace process,"" he added.    The ANC delegation told De Klerk that it had launched a concerted effort to end  the violence in Natal, including several short-lived peace agreements with  Inkatha leaders in some areas. But it said that none of its strategies would  work unless the government security forces began acting impartially.    The ANC leaders said that the government could end the fighting in Natal only  if its security forces took over from the self-government Kwazulu homeland's  police force, which is under the command of Buthelezi. The ANC also recommended  that police commanders in Natal establish open lines of communication with ANC  leaders.    De Klerk, saying he was deeply concerned about the escalating violence,  promised to consider the ANC's recommendations. The president added that the  government already had taken steps to increase police patrols in Natal and  improve socioeconomic conditions there.    De Klerk also said ""the growing sense of urgency in the country . . . demands a  commitment by all representative leaders to peacefully work out the  constitutional future of the country."" The remarks were an apparent reference  to Mandela's refusal to meet Buthelezi.    Mandela said that the ANC would give De Klerk time to respond to its  suggestions.    ""Despite (the government's) past record of making statements they have not  carried out, let us give them a chance,"" he said. But ""the government cannot be  allowed to talk peace and negotiation and at the same time conduct war against  us.""

The prime minister announced that His Majesty King Husayn is  to meet with President Bill Clinton after 20 January. Dr.  al-Majali said the session will help the peace talks and ties  between Jordan and the United States, particularly in the  economic area. Movement on the other tracks, especially on the  Syrian-Israeli track, will reflect positively on the other  fronts, the prime minister said.    Asked about the upcoming meeting between the Syrian and U.S.  Presidents in Geneva, al-Majali stated that Jordan and all the  partners to the Middle East peace process are hopeful it will  yield positive results. In its contacts, he added, Jordan has  underlined the comprehensiveness of the peace process and that  any headway made in one of the tracks is bound to extend to  other tracks.    The prime minister was asked how happy Jordan was with the  agreement reached with the Palestinians on 7 January. We are  quite happy with it, al-Majli said. The points on which  agreement was reached, he added, meet realistic expectations and  directly benefit the Palestinians as they now truly feel that  they have a partner and support in us. We are brothers bound by  distinguished ties, and as partners, the talks of the  Palestinians with the Israelis are bound to rub off on us. As  for the sense of urgency the Jordanians had shown in regard to  the agreement with the Palestinians, al-Majali said: I'll turn  the question around and ask why such an agreement with our  Palestinian brothers should wait. Right from the beginning of  the economic talks, the Palestinians were visibly anxious to get  an economic agreement with us. Two lengthy meetings of the  joint committee with the Palestinians produced a draft  agreement, but the Palestinian side, the prime minister noted,  slowed up and chose to wait. Jordan impressed on them the  importance of signing it in the interest of a clearly defined  bilateral relationship and so that they talk with the Israelis  against the background of a clear picture. Jordan, noted  al-Majali, has numerous institutions and the kind of  multi-faceted experience that the brother Palestinians may draw  on.    On inter-Arab ties, the prime minister stressed that Jordan  is working in good faith to have the best of relations with all  Arab states, especially with brothers in the Arabian Gulf  states. Jordan, he pointed out, has met with some success in  this regard, noting the receptiveness of Qatar and the United  Arab Emirates, as well as Oman, with which Jordan already had  close relations. The prime minister wished these relations  would grow ever stronger and extend to the rest of the brotherly  Arab states, noting that Egypt is working in that direction.     "

The two sides agreed on the need to adopt  a unified Arab stand toward the peace talks and against the  continuous Israeli procrastination in responding to the  requirements of a just, lasting, and comprehensive peace  acceptable to coming generations.    Israel has again proved its evasive policy toward the peace  process by foiling U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's  recent tour of the region as part of its attempts to conclude  separate deals with each Arab party. This requires a unified  Arab stand based on true and serious coordination. Perhaps, the  Amman- Damascus line is the basic pillar of this path.    In the current difficult circumstances, our Arab nation  needs, at least, a minimum level of solidarity to heal wounds  and to turn a new leaf in order to confront huge challenges.  These challenges are embodied by the peace process, the bloody  and regrettable fighting among the brothers in Yemen which has  been going on for more than two weeks, the unjust embargo  clamped on fraternal Iraq which has lost all its justifications,  and the embargo on fraternal Libya. Many other issues and  problems affecting Arabs and Muslims also require a courageous  stand.    The blessed 'Id al-Adha is the best opportunity to reexamine  inter-Arab relations, to show tolerance, to heal wounds, and to  proceed toward a better future that restores the nation to its  position and pride. While calling for making 'Id al-Adha a true  'Id for the entire nation so it can close ranks, we would like  to remember that His Majesty King Husayn has always been  persistent in his initiatives and efforts to settle and discard  Arab differences and return life to fraternal relations.

The paper says: Now that  there is renewed talk of the possible resumption of the peace  talks, Israel has demonstrated an enthusiastic excitement about  the peace process. While focusing its attention on the  implementation of the Gaza- Jericho accord, which yielded  countless advantages in its favor, Israel seeks to play games on  the other tracks of the negotiations. Israel reaped the fruits  of games with the Palestinians when it concluded the Oslo accord  with them. This is because this accord contains serious and  secret loopholes that allowed Israel to pounce upon the  Palestinians, who departed from the overall inter-Arab  coordination regarding the peace process.    AL-THAWRAH adds: Israel is certain that it cannot ensnare  any other Arab side by making it depart from the Arab consensus  regarding the need to achieve a just and comprehensive peace.  Nonetheless, it has continued to make desperate attempts in this  regard. If anything, this policy indicates that Israel is not  concerned with just, comprehensive, and durable peace. This is  because such peace is the antithesis of the expansionist Israeli  scheme and its Zionist objectives, which aim to achieve a  version of peace that allows Israel to have peace, and, at the  same time, retain its control over the territories.    The paper adds that Israel is only interested in the  benefits  it can draw from the peace process, particularly since it has  continued to evade any discussion of substantive issues in the  bilateral talks, namely, the issues of occupation and withdrawal.    Concluding its commentary, the paper says: The solution, as  all observers believe, lies in activating the role of the United  States as a full partner that should honor its pledges and  commitments, particularly since it is the party that launched  the peace initiative in the first place. Otherwise, the peace  process will be jeopardized, and the region will remain  vulnerable to worst case scenarios.    Under the headline ""Israel's Crimes Before the International  Community,"" the newspaper AL-BA'TH says: U.S. Secretary of  State Warren Christopher has reiterated his willingness to make  a fresh tour of the region to activate the peace process,  without committing himself to a forceful role in efforts to  address the Arab-Israeli conflict. It was no coincidence that  Christopher's offer came in the aftermath of Israeli attacks on  southern Lebanon and amidst the thunder of bullets that kill and  wound scores of Palestinians of the occupied Arab territories  every day. That is why he has absolved himself of any  undertaking to play a forceful role. He is well aware that  progress in the peace process is now contingent upon the Israeli  stand, which seeks to obstruct the regional peace process.    The paper believes that Israel aims to encircle the new  peace  opportunity that could be created if the peace talks are resumed  in Washington. The paper notes that in addition to political  maneuvering and foot-dragging, Israel has begun to carry out a  series of successive massacres that started with the Ibrahimi  Mosque massacre. This series of massacres is continuing.  Israel is now covering up its massacres with fresh ones, as  manifested in the Sayyidat al-Najat Church blast in Lebanon.    AL-BA'TH adds: By so doing, the Rabin government seeks to  distract those concerned with the peace process. It wants to  prompt them to address the new problems it is creating. Nobody  will be taken in by this policy, which has been stepped up  recently, particularly in the aftermath of the Geneva summit.  It is difficult for the Rabin government, regardless of the  tactics it is employing, to influence the course of the peace  negotiations, or to derail them.    Concluding its commentary, AL-BA'TH says: International  efforts to advance the peace process and resume the Washington  negotiations have become extremely necessary to end regional  tension and halt the Israeli anti-Arab terrorism, repression,  and massacres.

0,FT944-13883 ,"FT944-13883 _AN-EJZDWAA1FT 941026   FT  26 OCT 94 / Sri Lanka fears passions will erupt: Peace hopes are in doubt during run-up to poll for president      By STEFAN WAGSTYL   Colombo, where Mr Gamini Dissanayake, Sri Lanka's opposition leader, and 50 other people were killed by a suicide bomber on Monday, returned to normal with almost unseemly haste yesterday. The curfew imposed immediately after the blast was lifted and banks, shops and offices were open. It appeared that after living through two political assassinations last year, Sri Lankans have grown used to the murder of their leaders. Yet deep concern exists on the island about the lasting effects of Mr Dissanayake's death. The fear is that the passions aroused by the murder of such a popular leader will sooner or later come into the open. They might erupt into street violence as early as the funerals which begin today and end with Mr Dissanayake's state funeral on Saturday. Or they could linger and affect politics and society in more subtle but equally disruptive ways. 'People may not show it, but they are very distressed,' Mr Neelan Tiruchelvam, a Colombo lawyer, says. The public distress is acute because it has come at a time of unprecedented hope about Sri Lanka's future, engendered by the efforts of Mrs Chandrika Kumaratuna, the newly elected prime minister, to end the island's civil war. Mrs Kumaratunga, who took power in August after 17 years' rule by Mr Dissanayake's United National party, started talks with the Tamil 'Tigers', fighting for an independent Tamil homeland. As Mr Tiruchelvam, a Tamil, says: 'In Sri Lanka we swing quickly from optimism to despair. Now we are in despair'. The key question is the impact of the assassinations on the peace effort. Even though the police have little evidence linking the attack to the 'Tigers', the general assumption in Colombo is that they carried it out. The 'Tigers' have denied responsibility for the assassinations, but their denials carry little weight in Colombo. The security forces believe that only the 'Tigers' command the fierce loyalty and access to high-quality explosives needed to organise a suicide bombing. The 'Tigers' have been linked to two deadly suicide attacks, on Mr Rajiv Gandhi, the then Indian prime minister, in 1991, and Mr Ranasinghe Premadasa, the Sri Lankan president killed last year. In the weeks since her election victory, Mrs Kumaratunga had built broad-based support among the majority Sinhalese in favour of peace talks, but it seems certain this week's assassinations will undermine this consensus, though it is difficult to say by how much. 'The conditions for the peace talks were favourable. Now there will be great suspicion about the guerrillas' good faith. This is one of the worst consequences of the act,' a Colombo-based diplomat says. Mrs Kumaratunga has prudently postponed talks between government and Tamil representatives which started two weeks ago and were in progress near Jaffna, the Tamil stronghold in the north. She will now face calls for a long delay and for outright cancellation. Army officers, who claimed the government had made too many concessions, will now find it easier to criticise her. A crucial test of public opinion will come in the presidential election due to be held on November 9 in which Mr Dissanayake was challenging Mrs Kumaratunga. Mrs Kumaratunga had been expected to win, despite a strong campaign by Mr Dissanayake. His death should generate some sympathy votes for his party and votes from those wanting to protest at talks with the rebels. But the UNP could lose the support of Mr S. Thondaman, the powerful and politically volatile leader of the tea estate workers' union, wooed away from Mrs Kumaratunga by Mr Dissanayake but who could now swing his support back to the premier. On balance, Mrs Kumaratunga is still expected to win because the UNP lacks another candidate of Mr Dissanayake's stature. An unemphatic victory could stall the talks. Mr Desmond Fernando, a lawyer, says: 'I fear there could be a swing against compromise'. Sri Lanka has learned to live with political violence, especially in the past 18 months, which have seen three assassination attacks. Neither the death of President Premadasa, nor of Mr Lalith Athulathmudali, an opposition leader, provoked civil unrest or much social or economic disruption. Western tourists, sensitive to political violence, have continued to come to Sri Lanka. This time too, expectations are that little damage will be done to the economy. The Colombo Stock Exchange's all-share index fell by 31.74 points, 2.85 per cent, yesterday to 1,081.27, but stockbrokers said this was a reflex reaction. The economy remains strong and likely to meet the government's target of 6 per cent growth in gross domestic product this year, after a 6.9 per cent increase in 1993. Mr Kishan Vairawanathan, a manager at the Colombo office of Crosby Securities, the Hong Kong investment broker, says: 'A feeling of optimism has been shattered. That accounts for the fall. But I think the market will now stabilise'. But much will depend on the run-up to the presidential election and its outcome. If Mrs Kumaratunga fares badly, the hopes of peace vested in her may fade too.   Countries:-  LKZ  Sri Lanka, Asia.   Industries:-  P9721 International Affairs.

The Bosnian Serb assembly announced at dawn yesterday that it would reject the plan to divide Bosnia into 10 ethnic provinces despite the certainty of stepped-up sanctions on the last two republics left in Yugoslavia, namely Serbia and Montenegro. The self-styled assembly rejected the plan despite an appeal from Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic and his Montenegrin and Yugoslav counterparts. The message warned the deputies gathered in the Bosnian frontier town of Bijelina that they had 'no right to endanger 10m citizens of Yugoslavia because of. . . some minor points'. The refusal meant new United Nations sanctions took affect against Serbia and Montenegro. In Bonn, Mr Klaus Kinkel, the German foreign minister, called for the reconvening of the EC-chaired Yugoslav peace conference - excluding the warring parties - for the west and its allies to agree on new moves to bring peace to the region. He put forward his proposal at talks with Lord Owen, the EC peace envoy, to discuss the rejection of the Vance-Owen peace plan by the Bosnian Serbs. 'We are not saying the peace plan has failed,' a German Foreign Ministry spokesman said last night. 'If we said that, we would have to have an alternative, and nobody sees alternatives. 'We are saying the plan is temporarily rejected. The question is how we proceed from here. We fear the atrocities will continue. The participants at the conference - excluding the warring parties - must now decide what next steps they will take.' Lord Owen flew from Bonn to Copenhagen yesterday, where he was expected to put the German proposal to the Danish government, now in the EC chair. Mr Kinkel made it clear that he believed the Serbs should be put under 'the most massive pressure' to stop their aggression. Lord Owen described the Bosnian Serb proposal to hold a referendum in Bosnia as 'perfectly obscene' in the light of their campaign of annihilation of Bosnian Moslems.

Washington seems bent on undercutting His Majesty King  Husayn's courageous stand!! A meeting was supposed to have been  held at the U.S. State Department last Thursday to review the  Port of al-'Aqabah blockade, but was put off the day before,  lest a lifting of the siege be preceived as a reaction to his  majesty's position.    It seems very unlikely Washington will set a new date for  the  review before 17 April to make certain we will show up at the  waters conference in Muscat. This is a challenge we must come  to grips with, seeing that the U.S.-imposed blockade is to force  us into a particular course of action advancing Israeli  interests in relation to the peace process!!    The Port of al-'Aqabah blockade was not a UN decision; it  was  undertaken unilaterally by the United States.    The blockade has no connection with the UN Security Council  sanctions imposed on Iraq. Both Turkey and Iran have seaports  and both maintain more substantial economic ties than any such  relations Jordan may have with Iraq. Why, then, does not the  U.S. Navy inspect Turkish and Iranian ports?    In the matter of the blockade of the Port of al-'Aqabah,  then, there is more at stake than ensuring Jordan's compliance  with the Iraq sanctions resolution. At stake is a drive to  impoverish us and force us to our knees and then incorporate us  into Israel's strategic reach and transform us into a buffer  between the Zionist entity and each of Syria, Iraq, and Lebanon  and an extension of self-rule in Gaza and Jericho!    In any case, the so-called multilaterals do not seem to be  getting anywhere. With Syria and Lebanon not putting in an  appearance at talks supposedly tackling such issues as the  environment and waters, what is there to talk about?    These talks are zero; they are little more than symposiums  comparable to many gatherings held at Amman hotels. There does  not seem to be much point in the multilaterals beyond the fact  that they are convened in Arab capitals. The idea behind them,  then, is to serve as gateways for Israeli teams and television  crews, no matter how much we or our kinsfolk in the West Bank  and Gaza may resent it.    Initially, Japan, Canada, and Switzerland were chosen as  venues for the multilateral sessions. Israel demanded that they  be held in Cyprus. Washington, however, decided that they  should be hosted by Arab capitals.    Why do we attend such talks at all? Is it because Washington  wants us to? If that is so, what about our national and  pan-Arab interests? And, why should we oblige Washington while  it points a gun at our head?    We call on the government to take its cue from his majesty  the king. If the blockade is not lifted by 17 April, we should  not send a delegation to Muscat. We will not go along with a  peace settlement that sets out to impoverish us. Are we  supposed to become as impoverished as the West bank and Gaza  strip population before we become eligible for peace?     "

Sources in the office of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and in the Foreign  Ministry say the proposed initiatives center on the 1978 Camp David accords  between Egypt and Israel, which provided for a period of ""autonomy"" for  Palestinians living under Israeli occupation.    They say that presentation of a plan will eventually coincide with a publicity  campaign to win the support of the American public and, specifically,  influential Jewish groups in the United States.

They point out,  however, that because the plans are being weighed by Shamir, who has long been  considered an immovable object on peace talks, they reflect an effort by the  government to give a fresh face to Israeli policy.    ""What is new is that these ideas come from Shamir,"" said Yaron Ezrahi, a  political theorist at Hebrew University. ""It seems that at last he recognizes  that the situation is changing, so Israel must change to keep its head above  water.""    A Foreign Ministry official said: ""Shamir has some plans in mind. This is  clearly movement. But he hasn't reached any final decisions.""    Shamir told government radio Tuesday that he had not yet worked out a ""formal""  peace plan. Avi Pazner, his spokesman, would say only that the government is  ""studying now certain ideas based on our principles.""    The two comments were part of a denial of a report here in the Nation newspaper  that said Foreign Minister Moshe Arens gave U.S. Secretary of State George P.  Shultz a draft peace plan at a meeting on chemical warfare this week in Paris.    The report and the denials notwithstanding, a mosaic of proposals has appeared  here this week, both in conversations with government officials and in  published articles. Generally, the ideas center on two main issues: to whom  Israel would talk and what would be talked about.    First, the government remains opposed to talking with the PLO, which it views  as a terrorist organization committed to destroying Israel. However, Shamir is  toying with the idea of permitting elections in the occupied West Bank and Gaza  Strip aimed at letting Palestinians choose their own delegates to peace talks.  Previously, Shamir opposed such elections on the grounds that the PLO would  intimidate voters into voting for its candidates.    While conceding PLO victory in any such vote, the government views an election  as the lesser of two evils, the alternative being direct PLO representatives  chosen outside the occupied territories.      Only a Symbolic Role    Talks with the elected Palestinian delegates, plus officials from Egypt and  Jordan, could be held under the auspices of the United States and Soviet Union  or of the United Nations. But according to a report on Israel Radio, quoting  Shamir, the United Nations would play only a symbolic role and not ""intervene""  in any way.    From Israel's point of view, the goal of such talks would be to grant limited  autonomy, rather than statehood, to Arabs in the West Bank and Gaza. Autonomy  is defined as local self-rule by Palestinians until a longer-term resolution is  worked out.    In an interview with The Times, a top Shamir assistant, Yosef Ben-Aharon, said  that under autonomy, Arabs would be able to select their own local leaders and,  if Jordan would permit it, legislators in the Jordanian Parliament. Ben-Aharon  called this a plan for ""maximum autonomy.""    Ben-Aharon outlined an eventual economic union of Israel and Jordan plus the  West Bank and Gaza Strip that would permit a free flow of goods and travel  across the borders of each ""entity.""    He said that Israel would maintain security within the West Bank and Gaza in  order to prohibit the ""thrust of Arab power"" from settling on Israel's  doorstep.    Ben-Aharon blamed an apparent delay in coming up with a new peace policy on the  coalition of Shamir's rightist Likud Party and the center-left Labor Party.    ""New ideas have to be approved by a lot of people,"" he said, ""and that is a  slow process.""    The pressing interest here in producing a peace plan stems from Washington's  decision last month to talk with the PLO. The spectacle of Israel's foremost  ally talking with a group that sees peace coming in the form of a new  independent Arab state on Israel's borders stunned Israeli officials.    ""We are against any independent state west of the Jordan River,"" Ben-Aharon  said. ""Talks with the PLO would inevitably turn on the creation of a  Palestinian state.""    Egypt and Jordan have both recognized the Palestinian state, as has the Soviet  Union. The Israeli concept of autonomy for the Palestinians is rejected by the  PLO and its international supporters as a means of creeping annexation of the  occupied territories by Israel.    Israel has embarked on a renewed diplomatic campaign to get its point across,  but the way does not look easy.

However, Shamir is  toying with the idea of permitting elections in the occupied West Bank and Gaza  Strip aimed at letting Palestinians choose their own delegates to peace talks.  Previously, Shamir opposed such elections on the grounds that the PLO would  intimidate voters into voting for its candidates.    While conceding PLO victory in any such vote, the government views an election  as the lesser of two evils, the alternative being direct PLO representatives  chosen outside the occupied territories.      Only a Symbolic Role    Talks with the elected Palestinian delegates, plus officials from Egypt and  Jordan, could be held under the auspices of the United States and Soviet Union  or of the United Nations. But according to a report on Israel Radio, quoting  Shamir, the United Nations would play only a symbolic role and not ""intervene""  in any way.    From Israel's point of view, the goal of such talks would be to grant limited  autonomy, rather than statehood, to Arabs in the West Bank and Gaza. Autonomy  is defined as local self-rule by Palestinians until a longer-term resolution is  worked out.    In an interview with The Times, a top Shamir assistant, Yosef Ben-Aharon, said  that under autonomy, Arabs would be able to select their own local leaders and,  if Jordan would permit it, legislators in the Jordanian Parliament. Ben-Aharon  called this a plan for ""maximum autonomy.""    Ben-Aharon outlined an eventual economic union of Israel and Jordan plus the  West Bank and Gaza Strip that would permit a free flow of goods and travel  across the borders of each ""entity.""    He said that Israel would maintain security within the West Bank and Gaza in  order to prohibit the ""thrust of Arab power"" from settling on Israel's  doorstep.    Ben-Aharon blamed an apparent delay in coming up with a new peace policy on the  coalition of Shamir's rightist Likud Party and the center-left Labor Party.    ""New ideas have to be approved by a lot of people,"" he said, ""and that is a  slow process.""    The pressing interest here in producing a peace plan stems from Washington's  decision last month to talk with the PLO. The spectacle of Israel's foremost  ally talking with a group that sees peace coming in the form of a new  independent Arab state on Israel's borders stunned Israeli officials.    ""We are against any independent state west of the Jordan River,"" Ben-Aharon  said. ""Talks with the PLO would inevitably turn on the creation of a  Palestinian state.""    Egypt and Jordan have both recognized the Palestinian state, as has the Soviet  Union. The Israeli concept of autonomy for the Palestinians is rejected by the  PLO and its international supporters as a means of creeping annexation of the  occupied territories by Israel.    Israel has embarked on a renewed diplomatic campaign to get its point across,  but the way does not look easy.

0,FT934-10086 ,"FT934-10086 _AN-DKHDHAAGFT 931108   FT  08 NOV 93 / Peace in Ulster possible by Christmas, says Irish PM      By TIM COONE      DUBLIN   NORTHERN Ireland could have peace by Christmas if the British and Irish governments grasped a unique opportunity for peace, Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, said yesterday. He said: 'I believe (the opportunity) is there, and I want to see (Mr Major) take the courage and conviction in his hands, because we have a moment in history to do it and it may not be there for a long, long time again.' Speaking on BBC TV's On the Record programme, Mr Reynolds said: 'I believe there is an enormous responsibility on us to lead in this situation. We have an opportunity, let's maximise it. History will never forgive us if we don't' In separate radio interviews, Mr Reynolds said: 'I believe that if those crunch issues are addressed in an open and frank manner, with courage and conviction on both sides, it is possible we can see the beginning of peace before Christmas.' Mr Reynolds' attempt to shift the onus on to Mr Major in part reflects the pressures from within his own Fianna Fail party that Dublin should win more open concessions for the nationalist community in the north. Dublin believes that after its recent signals of willingness to meet concerns of Ulster Unionists about the future of Northern Ireland's political system, Mr Major should signal he is prepared to consider nationalist demands over the north. In an apparent divergence with the British government over the aims of the initiative on Northern Ireland that the two prime ministers announced 10 days ago in Brussels, Mr Reynolds insisted the priority should be a cessation of violence. He said a resumption of political talks between the main constitutional parties would not be sufficient. 'If you don't get the people who are carrying out the violence to cease violence, then I don't believe political talks are going to bring an end to violence.' He reiterated that if there were to be a proven end to the IRA military campaign, 'there is a place at the table for Sinn Fein . . . That is the (sequence) of events as I see them that will bring results'. However, Mr Reynolds is having to thread an increasingly delicate path through his own party. At Fianna Fail's annual conference in Dublin at the weekend he faced criticism from delegates for his move to sideline the initiative launched by Mr John Hume, leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party, and Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein. Mr Reynolds responded by praising but not endorsing the contribution to the peace process by Mr Hume, who was last night admitted to hospital suffering 'flu. 'Mr Hume's contribution is essential to any wide-based overall framework for peace. (But) the creation of that peace must ultimately be the responsibility of the Irish and British governments,' he said. The Royal Ulster Constabulary is to investigate the shooting of a woman by a soldier last night near Omagh, County Tyrone. The RUC said the woman, later reported to be 'ill but stable' in hospital, was a passenger in a car. A number of children in the vehicle were treated for cuts and shock.

Peres, who is also Israel's minister of finance and head of its Labor Party,  told reporters: ""Before too long, there is a real chance that a Palestinian and  Israeli delegation will meet in Cairo to discuss the issue of elections and the  beginning of meaningful negotiations between the two parties.

Indeed, Prime  Minister Yitzhak Shamir, through a spokesman on Tuesday, rejected similar  positive predictions from Peres, denying that any agreement is at hand.    Sources close to the talks said it is likely that Peres will use the Egyptian  visit to step up pressure on Shamir's hard-line Likud Party, which has resisted  attempts to include Palestinians from outside the Israeli-occupied West Bank  and Gaza Strip in the Palestinian delegation as well as attempts by the  Palestinians to use the dialogue to discuss the future of a possible state.    Earlier this month, Peres threatened to pull his Labor Party out of the fragile  coalition government unless the deadlock were overcome. And sources close to  Wednesday's talks said Peres emerged convinced that the inclusion of deportees  from the territories in the Palestinian delegation should not remain a  stumbling block, even if it means renewing his threat to withdraw from the  coalition.    Neither Peres nor Egyptian officials elaborated on the new proposals discussed  during Peres' two-hour meeting with Mubarak.

PLO officials in Cairo, who asked not to be identified, said the PLO probably  would not object to such conditions.    However, the PLO has insisted on maintaining control over any Palestinian  delegation, and Peres emphasized Wednesday that it is still Israel's policy  that the delegation to Cairo ""should be a non-PLO delegation representing  people who reside in the territories and not people who are active outside the  territories.""

0,FT933-5740 ,"FT933-5740 _AN-DIBB8AAGFT 930902   FT  02 SEP 93 / Bosnia peace talks fail over land demands      By LAURA SILBER and FRANCES WILLIAMS   THE BOSNIAN peace talks in Geneva broke down yesterday, prompting Lord Owen, international mediator, to warn of the danger of a deeper slide into 'anarchy and war' if the three sides did not reach a speedy settlement. Lord Owen said: 'The talks have failed because there is not an agreement on the map. They all want more territory than either of the others is prepared to give.' However, along with his fellow mediator, Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, he held out hope that the proposal would remain on the table. The alternative was 'fragmentation, anarchy, warlords and chaos'. He admitted that 'barring a miracle or a sudden shift in one of the parties' he did not expect negotiations to resume today, although he said the leaders of the three warring parties - Croats, Moslems and Serbs - had agreed to remain in Geneva until today. None of the leaders ruled out resuming talks in the near future. Amid fears of a surge in fighting in central Bosnia, the republic's president Alija Izetbegovic, a Moslem, said his army would 'respect the ceasefire. But, of course, whether there will be war or not does not depend only on us'. Serbian president Slobodan Milosevic, who appeared enraged by the breakdown of the talks, said he was sure the Bosnian Serbian forces would respect the ceasefire, which was put in place earlier this week. Earlier Croatian president Franjo Tudjman predicted that the fighting would continue unabated. Clashes have intensified in central Bosnia as Croat and Moslem troops have tried to grab more land. Members of the Moslem delegation were reported to be in tears as the Croats left the talks. Mr Izetbegovic blamed the collapse on the failure of Serb and Croat leaders to make essential concessions to his land-locked republic. 'The minimum of minimums which we put before the conference today would have allowed an economically and political viable state,' he said. 'They (Serbs and Croats) have rejected our requirements and therefore this round of talks failed,' he told a news conference. The key sticking point appeared to be Moslem demands for the restoration of 'ethnically cleansed' territory in eastern and north-western Bosnia and the land connection to the sea at the Adriatic port of Neum. The setback surprised observers after a day in which all three sides had indicated they were on the verge of agreement. Mr Charles Redman, President Bill Clinton's special envoy, said: 'I think it is a tragedy that they could not come to a solution.' In an attempt to persuade the Bosnian delegation to accept the offer, which included a widened 1.8 mile corridor connecting the three eastern enclaves but failed to meet any other Moslem demands, Mr Milosevic held a 15-minute private session with Mr Izetbegovic. Earlier, the Bosnian government had laid the ground for a possible agreement by scaling back its demands for territorial concessions. Mr Izetbegovic had put forward a proposal that his republic should receive an additional 4 per cent of land on top of the 28 per cent already allocated under the proposed partition. Previous Moslem proposals had demanded at least 10 per cent more land. Amid fears of renewed fighting, Lt Gen Francis Briquemont, UN commander in Sarajevo, yesterday travelled to Medjugorje, near Mostar, to supervise ceasefire talks between Bosnians and Croats. Meanwhile, Mr Manfred Worner, secretary-general of Nato, yesterday met Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, in Geneva, to discuss the possible deployment of more peacekeeping troops.

0,FT944-6364 ,"FT944-6364 _AN-EK3EKABPFT 941130   FT  30 NOV 94 / Sinn Fein barred from forum      By DAVID OWEN and JOHN MURRAY BROWN   Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, will not be allowed to attend an important Belfast investment conference. The decision emerged yesterday as cabinet ministers involved in the Northern Ireland peace process met in London for the first time since the collapse of the Dublin coalition. The move reinforced the mounting impression at Whitehall that preliminary talks between the government and Sinn Fein are unlikely to start before the conference, which will be held on December 13 and 14 and is to be launched by Mr John Major, the prime minister. The Northern Ireland Office denied that yesterday's decision had any bearing on the starting date for the talks, which the government has promised would begin before Christmas. But Sinn Fein attacked the move, saying it was 'another stalling tactic by the British government in its efforts to reduce the momentum of the peace process'. Meeting at Downing Street, ministers are understood to have discussed both the prospect of talks with Sinn Fein and progress on the so-called UK-Irish framework document which will form the basis for future talks involving Ulster's main political parties. Senior civil servants have continued to make headway on the document in spite of the power vacuum in Dublin. But they are understood to have gone as far as possible with-out further ministerial guidance. Three main sticking points remain: Article two of the Irish Republic's constitution, enshrining Dublin's territorial claim over the province. The so-called 'European dimension' dealing with how relations between the north and south of the island and the rest of Europe are handled. The so-called 'default mechanism' dealing with the handling of reservations about decisions made by the planned Ulster assembly. Dublin is understood to have argued that this mechanism should take the form of a joint committee of the Anglo-Irish conference. London wants both governments to be able to examine such reservations separately. Meanwhile in Dublin, another adjournment of the Irish Republic's parliament seems likely today with political parties still unable to agree terms for a new coalition in the wake of the collapse of the 22-month Fianna Fail and Labour government and the resignation of Mr Albert Reynolds as prime minister. Fianna Fail, the largest partner in the outgoing government, last night seemed close to initiating formal negotiations with Labour. However Mr Bertie Ahern, Fianna Fail leader, is coming under pressure from within his party to take a tough line with Labour.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

In statements to AL-RA'Y, the minister added that Jordan's  Ministry of Communications has supplied the PNA with a copy of  the Ministry's structural organization, as well as job  descriptions of the Ministry's components, sections, and  institutions at the request of PNA Minister of Post and  Communications 'Abd-al-Hafiz al-Ashhab, who held talks with  several Ministry officials in this regard. Al-Ashhab also  obtained details about the Jordanian telephone system.    Dr. al-Suhaymat added that the Palestinian side requested to  benefit from the Jordanian expertise so that Palestinian cadres  may learn from them. He noted that Jordan will provide the  Palestinian self-rule authority with experts, technicians, and  engineers in the field of postal services and communications.  Additionally, Jordan will provide training to several PNA  employees working in this field at Jordanian institutions.    Al-Suhaymat indicated that the talks with al-Ashhab also  touched on effecting a direct telephonic linkage between the  Jordanian telephone network and the network expected to be  established in Gaza and Jericho. He asserted Jordan's readiness  to implement this linkage once the PNA requests this.    When queried further on the issue, Dr. al-Suhaymat said that  Jordan will effect a direct telephonic linkage with the  Palestinian side only in Gaza and Jericho at present, and in the  West Bank later. He noted that there will not be any kind of  telephonic linkages with or through Israel pending the outcome  of the peace talks. He added: ""It is premature to speak of a  linkage with Israel at present.""    Dr. al-Suhaymat indicated that Jordan has officially and  repeatedly urged the world states not to relay telephone calls  from Israel to Jordan.    With respect to cooperation in the field of postal services,  the minister of communications said that Jordan, in talks with  the Palestinians, has expressed its full readiness to transport  the mail coming from various parts of the world to the  autonomous areas via the King Husayn Bridge and vice versa in  accordance with the norms and methods currently in force.    Dr. al-Suhaymat added that the Palestinian self-rule  authority must obtain an international telephonic code for its  communications so that it may gain complete independence from  Israel in this regard. He went on to say that this would be  less costly than using the Israeli network.    The minister indicated that Jordan will witness great  developments in the field of communications once peace is  achieved. He added that the Communications Corporation is making  enormous efforts to implement its projects over the next few  months to prepare for the start of the 21st century.     "

The diplomats said the imminent lifting of the siege on  al-'Aqabah would open the door for Jordan's resumption of its  ""important"" role in the peace process and would allow for its  participation in the next round of bilateral peace talks  expected to begin in Washington next month.    The diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said  Jordan has agreed to pay the estimated $2 to 3 million annual  fees for the non-profit Lloyds Register but the United States is  insisting that the payments be made through the United Nations  so that Jordan ""will not be able to influence the organisation.""    They said Washington was also insisting that Lloyds Register  establish a direct link with the U.N. Sanctions Committee in  order to supervise exports to Iraq that are permitted by the  trade embargo on Baghdad.    Among other ""minor technicalities"" still under negotiations  between Jordan and the U.S. and other members of the  multilateral interdiction forces enforcing the naval blockade on  al-'Aqabah is a mechanism through which member countries of the  force will be able to inspect Lloyds Register's operations, the  sources told the JORDAN TIMES.    Though no Security Council resolution is needed to change  the  mechanism through which al-'Aqabah-bound shipping is being  checked under Security Council Resolution 665, the diplomats  said consultations among member states of the council are  required, adding that these consultations are underway already  in New York.    The U.S. on Sunday reportedly communicated to Jordan its  formal acceptance of the Kingdom's proposal to replace the  sea-inspection with land-based verifications through a letter  sent by Secretary of State Warren Christopher.    The U.S. decision came few days after France decided to pull  out from the force enforcing the blockade on al-'Aqabah and  Canada reportedly rejected an American request that Canadians  replace the French in this task.    The Western diplomats said France saw no reason for the  continuation of the sea-inspection operations since the  Jordanian proposal provided a fitting alternative and found no  justification for Washington's procrastination in implementing  the proposal which was made by the Kingdom in January.    Jordan had earlier linked its participation in the peace  talks with the lifting of the siege on al-'Aqabah which many  officials described as pressure on Jordan to force it into  entering a separate peace accord with Israel.    Informed sources say the U.S. Congress, which ""has not yet  forgiven"" the Kingdom for its opposition to the Gulf war  coalition that drove Iraq out of Kuwait in 1991 and some U.S.  security agencies which ""do not trust Jordan"" have been behind  the delay in lifting the siege on al-'Aqabah.    Information Minister Jawad al-'Anani confirmed Tuesday that  the Jordanian government has received confirmation from the  concerned American authorities that Washington had approved the  Jordanian proposal.    He said the next steps were to reach a final agreement with  Lloyds Register to determined the methods of observing cargo  entering al-'Aqabah. This might be achieved within the coming  three weeks, he said.    Dr al-'Anani said that the representative of Lloyds Register  would not be inspecting ships, but will be monitoring incoming  cargo when they are opened at the port to make sure that they  conform to the cargo manifests.

Four American congressmen were flying to  the city of Malanje on a fact-finding visit. They never made it.  The UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola]  rebels launched a bombardment of the city and the plane carrying  the Americans turned back. So did the United Nations plane in  which our correspondent Chris Simpson was travelling. He is now  back in Luanda and sent this report.    Flagelamentos [shellings] is what we heard over the radio as  our plane was 30 minutes away from Malanje. It is a word you  hear a lot in Angola. Loosely translated, it means attacks or  bombardments. Confirmation rapidly came that UNITA had indeed  been shelling Malanje and the four U.S. congressmen and [words  indistinct] in the other plane had been turned back for security  reasons. Malanje was, at least temporarily, off limits, just as  it was for weeks on end last year when the city starved for lack  of food aid. At least it is never dull here, an aid official  [word indistinct] observed, amid a series of urgent radio  messages.    The World Food Program, which is currently sending eight  planes a day to Malanje, put its Malange operations on a standby  and the congressmen's itinerary was rapidly rearranged. Angolan  national radio later claimed that UNITA had been shelling  persistently since the early hours of the morning, causing at  least (?two deaths).    Why now, why today, of all days, when the peace talks are  back on? These were the questions everyone was asking. It  remains to be seen whether UNITA will have any answers to offer.  Jonas Savimbi's movement might argue, however, that all  publicity is good publicity and that having been left off the  visiting congressmen's itinerary, it was only fair that UNITA be  allowed to spoil the rest of the program.

However, he warned that full peace would not be achieved unless Israel gave up its claim to the city of Jerusalem. He said his government is taking 'foolproof (and) wisely regulated steps' towards peace with Israel. But he stressed the need for dialogue among Jews, Christians and Moslems on the future status of Jerusalem. 'We recognise no sovereignty over (the city) except that of the almighty God,' he said. Jordan endorsed an agenda for peace with Israel on September 14, a day after the Palestine Liberation Organisation and Israel signed their agreement in Washington. Since then, several understandings on economic relations with Israel, the environment, water, and land have reportedly been secretly initialled. King Hussein has acknowledged that items on the agenda will be agreed in a piecemeal fashion but has so far ruled out talk of an imminent unilateral agreement. Although behind-the-scenes progress is being made, the king has repeatedly called for urgent talks on Jerusalem. Under the PLO-Israeli deal the city's status will not be negotiated until after a two-year interim period. The Hashemites have strong links with the city. East Jerusalem was part of Jordan between 1948 and 1967 and the king's grandfather and great-grandfather are buried there. The king is personally funding renovation work on Moslem holy sites in the city, including the Dome of the Rock mosque. While Jerusalem is set to be one of the more difficult sticking points between Jordan and Israel, the kingdom's 80-member parliament should be less reactionary to prospects of peace than its predecessor. The number of deputies opposed to peace has fallen as a result of the multi-party elections held on November 8. In his speech, King Hussein said Jordan expected economic growth of 6 per cent for this year, while inflation would not exceed 4.5 per cent. The council of ministers yesterday unanimously endorsed next year's JD1.5bn (Pounds 1.4bn) draft budget, Reuter adds. The budget will be formally presented to parliament early next month for final approval. King Hussein said local revenue in next year's budget would cover current costs and a large part of capital costs. He pledged to continue economic reforms agreed with the International Monetary Fund. The debt-ridden country has counted on foreign aid to reduce chronic budget and balance of payments deficits.   Countries:-  JOZ  Jordan, Middle East.     ILZ  Israel, Middle East.

Ministers have insisted for weeks they are not waiting for  an  IRA/Sinn Fein response but are pushing ahead with efforts to  find agreement between political parties on a predominantly  internal settlement.    In an interview in today's BELFAST TELEGRAPH, however,  Michael Ancram, the Northern Ireland minister responsible for  developing the suspended inter-party talks, concedes that peace  and a political settlement are ""inextricably linked.""    ""The declaration and the talks are part and parcel of the  same process,"" he said. ""I don't believe you can have peace  without a widely acceptable political settlement and I think you  probably can't have a widely acceptable political settlement  without peace."" His comments imply that without the IRA  renouncing violence, the prospect of inter-party talks reaching  agreement are slim.    Mr Ancram's comments come on the eve of the meeting between  the Irish Taoiseach, Albert Reynolds, and John Major at Downing  Street to review progress of the inter-party talks as well as  Sinn Fein's response to the joint declaration signed by both  governments before Christmas.    Yesterday, the Northern Ireland Secretary, Sir Patrick  Mayhew, said that he was hoping to see new institutions of joint  co-operation between the North and south of Ireland set up as  part of his package designed to bring agreement between Dublin,  London and the four constitutional parties in Northern Ireland.    He welcomed ""any step that is intended to develop  co-operation on economic and other matters."" He thought that  the new institutions ""could be undertaken...without impinging on  the sovereignty of Northern Ireland.""    Sir Patrick, speaking in the Commons, was pressed by his  shadow, Kevin McNamara, on whether new North-South bodies  dealing with issues like as the economy or infrastructure should  have an executive role, based on ground rules laid down by both  governments.    Sir Patrick argued that ""any organisation, call it a board  or  a structure, should have clear objectives, with clearly defined  lines of authority, coming from wherever it is appropriate,  whether it is Westminster, Dublin, or any subsequently  established legislative body.""    The British Government sent secret outline proposals to  Dublin this month on the extension of co-operation between the  two parts of Ireland.    The Ulster Unionists would like the bodies to be almost  exclusively consultative, but are willing to see the British  representatives drawn from a Northern Ireland assembly.    James Molyneaux, the Unionists' leader, indicated that  representives of a proposed Ulster assembly could talk to the  South, as long as ""the sovereignty of Northern Ireland remained  undiminished.""

'The welcome mat is out,' he told Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, at the start of a two-day summit at Kennebunkport, Mr Bush's east coast holiday home. The summit is expected to pave the way for progress in Middle East peace negotiations and on American guarantees for loans to build homes for Jewish immigrants arriving in Israel from the former Soviet Union. It was the first meeting between the two leaders since Israel's Labour leader defeated his hardline opponent, Mr Yitzhak Shamir, in June's general election - a victory welcomed in Washington. 'Prime minister Rabin has many friends in the US, including the man standing next to him,' said Mr Bush. Mr Rabin responded that his government wished to alter Israel's national priorities and to give peace negotiations, which will resume in Washington on August 24, a chance to succeed. 'We would like to give a chance, a real chance, to the peace negotiations within the framework of the Madrid conference,' said Mr Rabin. 'We would like to change the order of our national priorities. 'We believe that the real problems are in the domestic field, in addition to making a real effort to negotiate peace seriously without endangering Israel's security.' The two days of talks, attended by Mr James Baker, the US secretary of state, are expected to cover a broad range of Middle East and international issues, including Iraqi president Saddam Hussein's latest challenge to United Nations' resolutions and the crisis in Bosnia-Hercegovina. Israel has largely cleared the way for US approval of loan guarantees for up to Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5.2bn) by imposing a virtual freeze on building new Jewish settlements in the Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war. The US refused to accede to Mr Shamir's earlier loan guarantee request, insisting that the commitment of his Likud party to building more settlements in the West Bank and Gaza was a serious obstacle to the peace process. Mr Rabin has also pledged to negotiate speedily with the Palestinians the establishment of an interim self-governing authority for the West Bank and Gaza, pending final agreement on the ultimate status of the territories. The possible shape of such an interim arrangement was formulated by Egypt, Israel and the US during the 1978 Camp David negotiations, but rejected at the time by the Palestine Liberation Organisation and Arab governments. A Jordanian newspaper claimed yesterday that Israeli and Palestinian representatives had already reached an agreement during secret talks in Cairo on limited autonomy for the West Bank and Gaza. However, Ms Hanan Ashrawi, spokeswoman for the Palestinian delegation to the peace talks, denied the report, saying it did not reflect the deliberations and work of the negotiating team. Israel has signalled a wish to create a better negotiating atmosphere by indicating it will repeal a law forbidding meetings with official members of the PLO. But hostility within Israel to the new government's initiatives was again evident with hardline settlers' groups pledging to continue building in the occupied territories. Mr Micha Harish, the trade minister, said after a cabinet meeting that the settlers' aim was clearly political and geared towards harming the visit of the prime minister to the US.

0,FT944-4593 ,"FT944-4593 _AN-ELHD0AHCFT 941207   FT  07 DEC 94 / Russia rejects Chechnya invasion      By JOHN THORNHILL      MOSCOW   Russia and the the break-away republic of Chechnya have agreed to settle their differences without force following last-ditch peace talks held yesterday in the neighbouring region of Ingushetia. The deal appears to be expedient for both sides to save face without resorting to what promised to be a fierce and bloody conflict. Both President Dzhokhar Dudayev of Chechnya, and General Pavel Grachev, Russia's defence minister, emerged from more than an hour of talks to declare: 'There will not be a military solution to the question.' The terms of the agreement were not immediately known, although the priorities of both sides had been well-aired beforehand. Before the meeting, Gen Grachev said the Russian government had not exhausted all avenues for peace but made it clear he would treat Mr Dudayev as a representative of one the Russian Federation's constituent republics rather than as the head of a foreign state. Russian military sources suggested that Gen Grachev would insist on three conditions being met: an early meeting between Mr Dudayev and the opposition forces; the disarming of illegal military units in Chechnya; and the immediate release of all Russian servicemen captured in the recent fighting. Chechen officials had originally claimed to have captured 70 Russian servicemen but it now appears that 21 Russians have been held captive. According to the Interfax news agency, Mr Dudayev's intentions in the talks were to ensure that Russia would stop supporting Chechen opposition attacks and would withdraw its regular armed forces, which have been ominously massing on the republic's border. Mr Grachev had earlier met Chechen opposition leaders and promised them he would insist on free parliamentary elections being held. The Russian government appeared torn between wanting to re-establish its authority in a rebellious part of the federation and fearing the consequences of being drawn into a long guerrilla war. The Chechen government had made dire threats against Russia if it sent in its troops, promising 'a second Afghanistan'. The Russian parliament - and public opinion - also appeared sharply divided. While some leading politicians in Moscow urged stern measures to end the rebellion, others such as Mr Yegor Gaidar, head of the Democratic Choice party, warned that a military solution would lead 'to nothing but bloodshed and the establishment of a military regime in the country'. Chechnya, which declared its independence from Moscow three years ago, has been a festering sore in Russia's body politic ever since. The Russian government has provided financial support and moral encouragement to the Chechen opposition, which created a provisional council to oust Mr Dudayev.

The move, which could ignite violent conflict among Palestinians, has exposed the acute dilemma faced by Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman. If he does not take stiff measures against Hamas, the peace process momentum will quickly decline; if he does crack down on Hamas, seen by many Palestinians as freedom fighters against continued Israeli occupation of Arab land, he risks unpopularity and the threat of civil war. Israel's Premier Yitzhak Rabin welcomed the arrests, calling it a 'good sign' after a spate of attacks by Hamas gunmen on Israelis in the Gaza Strip. In Damascus, Hamas condemned the crackdown, accusing Mr Arafat of 'playing the role of the enemy's army', and said it would continue the armed struggle against Israel. Earlier, Mr Rabin had visited the Jewish settlement block in the Strip and toured the road in Gaza where Hamas guerrillas killed an Israeli and wounded six others in ambushes on Sunday. 'It is inconceivable we will continue the process without seeing on the part of the Palestinian Authority a serious effort to deal with those terrorist elements,' Mr Rabin said. The Israeli military said there had been 39 attacks by Palestinian militants since they redeployed their forces three months ago, and not a single gunman had been arrested by Palestinian police. Mr Rabin said he had frozen talks on releasing more Israeli-held Palestinian prisoners. Officials said Israel could halt negotiations on reaching agreement on transferring power from Israeli to Palestinian hands over West Bank education, health, taxation, welfare and tourism. Israel could also delay opening a safe corridor between Gaza and Jericho, and setting up Palestinian terminals at the Rafah and Allenby Bridge crossings.   Countries:-  ILZ  Israel, Middle East.

0,FT942-12561 ,"FT942-12561 _AN-ED2DAAAZFT 940429   FT  29 APR 94 / Intelligence points to IRA-Iran drug connection      By JIMMY BURNS, DAVID OWEN and PAUL ABRAHAMS   The IRA has been drawing on financial support from Iran, possibly linked to drugs transactions, and may have been on the verge of securing a large arms shipment. This information, gathered by intelligence agencies, including Britain's MI6, appears to be behind the decision by the Foreign Office yesterday to warn the Tehran government to desist from further contacts with the Irish terrorist organisation. British officials insist they had no alternative to taking yesterday's high profile action because of the firm nature of the information gathered. Although some money is believed to have been exchanged between Iran and the Irish Republican Army, the action was largely pre-emptive and designed to stop the links from strengthening. UK intelligence has been monitoring political links between the IRA and Tehran since the early 1980s. Recently the suspicion has grown that the IRA may have been aiming to secure financial and military support from Tehran as an alternative to Libya, which has been a main supplier of weapons and explosives. The tilt towards Tehran follows intense efforts by the FBI and UK security forces to stop funding and logistical support from the US, and a crackdown on racketeering in Northern Ireland linked to the IRA. Yesterday's announcement follows the recent arrest in Greece of two German subjects allegedly linked to a drugs operation involving the IRA and the Middle East. The latest disclosure comes at a particularly sensitive time in Northern Ireland, with violence again on the increase and the main political parties in the province - including the IRA's political wing Sinn Fein - gearing up for the European election. This will inevitably be seen in Northern Ireland as a referendum on the Anglo-Irish peace initiative. According to observers, there would be few more effective ways of undermining support for Sinn Fein in advance of this crucial poll than by linking the IRA to drug trafficking. Republican leaders have traditionally been careful to disassociate themselves from drug-related crime and have frequently resorted to gun law to punish alleged traffickers. Earlier this week the IRA killed one alleged dealer and injured 16 others in an offensive whose timing was felt by observers to have been heavily influenced by the election.

This meeting was a good opportunity for His Majesty King  Husayn to emphasize anew the constants of Jordan's firm position  in supporting the ongoing peace process and realizing the  aspired peace in the region based on the principles of  international legitimacy, and the UN and Security Council  resolutions led by Resolutions 242 and 338.    In view of the vital role France is playing in the Bonsian  crisis, whether its leading role within the EC or the Security  Council, it was natural for the Jordanian-French talks to deal  with the Bosnian conflict and to discuss ways of cooperation on  bringing an end to the tragic situation of the Muslims there,  and realize security, stability, and peace in that region.    The broad background of the Jordanian-French relations and  the continued positive development in the history of cooperation  between Amman and Paris have always allowed for the exchange of  views on the basis of mutual respect regarding many issues and  subjects that concern the two friendly countries, including  economic and cultural cooperation between Jordan and France.    We know beforehand that France can always play a more vital,  if not pioneering, role in this region's issues, especially  since this leading European state has continued to enjoy  political broadmindedness, and its vital role in the Middle East  has continued to be welcomed by all parties to the conflict.  This qualifies France to play a welcome role in entrenching  stability, realizing peace, and accelerating the development  process.     "

It is natural that the resumption of the  negotiations should be linked with the degree of seriousness in  Israel's answers to the basic questions Secretary of State  Christopher carried from Damascus after he held detailed talks  with President Hafiz al-Asad.    It is also natural that progress or stalemate in the peace  process should be linked to real change in Israel's position.  No one would disagree that the establishment of peace needs  action rather than sweet talk on the importance of and the need  for achieving that peace. The U.S. Administration has sensed  Syria's true intentions, and President Bill Clinton has not  concealed this. Moreover, he has reiterated on many occasions  his belief in Syria's credible position and its serious trend  toward peace. Christopher did the same during his tour of the  region last week.    Syria's concern for pushing the peace process forward,  however, does not at all mean any relinquishment of its  constants or any bargaining over territory, rights, and  sovereignty. These are matters that Syria will never reconsider  under any circumstances. President Bill Clinton's  administration, as well as Israel, knows this fact.    Total withdrawal from Golan is the basis for negotiations on  the Syrian track. This occupied Syrian territory should return  completely to the motherland, as it used to be before the June  aggression of 1967. Syria's right to sovereignty over its  territory is a fact that cannot, and will not be bypassed. What  applies to Golan also applies to the occupied part of southern  Lebanon and to Jordanian territories occupied by Israel. Hence,  the importance of continued coordination among the Arab parties  involved in the peace process. This coordination will be a  guarantee for the Arabs and will constitute a weapon that will  enable them to regain their usurped rights and their occupied  territories and to avoid the Israeli trap of unilateral deals  and partial settlements.    Experience has shown that such settlements will not achieve  peace, but will undermine the chances of achieving a  comprehensive and just peace. The best example is the  disappointment of the Palestinians in the occupied Arab  territories following the signing of the fragile self-rule  accord, which will keep the Palestinian people subject to  Israel's mercy and domination.    Syria is working to establish a comprehensive peace and  durable peace that will not create disappointments. Such a  peace cannot be achieved without the implementation of the  relevant UN resolutions and the land-for-peace principle, which  former President George Bush's administration proposed, and on  which the Madrid conference was launched under the U.S. and  Russian sponsorship, and to which current President Clinton's  administration committed itself after pledging to play a fair  and complete partner in the peace process.    Those who seek such a peace will find every cooperation from  Syria. But if talk about peace is merely an Israeli maneuver,  no new tour by Washington will achieve anything to save the  peace process from the crisis in which the Israeli rulers have  placed it.    Syria has repeatedly asserted that peace falls within the  strategy it has adopted for many years. But the other side,  Israel, has been talking about peace at a time when it places  obstacles, mines, and thorns on the road. Today, we say that  the opportunity to achieve peace is available if intentions are  sincere and if statements turn into action on the ground.  Otherwise, the establishment of a just and comprehensive peace  will remain out of reach. This fact will be sensed by the head  of U.S. diplomacy, Warren Christopher, when he returns to the  Middle East. He should deal with facts and deeds to succeed in  his new mission and so that the peace process can witness a real  move toward its desired goal.     "

The foreign secretaries of  the two countries will have two days of parleys to negotiate  comprehensively on all aspects of Jammu and Kashmir issue,  besides other bilateral matters. The Indian foreign secretary  is reaching Islamabad tomorrow. Pakistan Television diplomatic  correspondent says this is for the first time that India has  explicitly agreed to place the Kashmir issue on the agenda of  talks. Pakistan on its part has always been raising the Kashmir  issue during previous high-level talks between the two  countries, while India always tried to avoid the question.    In Islamabad, a Foreign Office spokesman has said the  forthcoming talks with India will be the final round of formal  dialogue between the two countries if New Delhi shows no  flexibility on the Kashmir dispute. He told reporters yesterday  that there will be no more formal talks on bilateral relations  if the Indians fail to come with concrete proposals on Kashmir.  Pakistan, the spokesman said, is willing to discuss nuclear and  other issues with India only if it shows serious interest in  resolving the dispute over the occupied valley. Kashmir, he  added, is the flash point and there can be no peace in the  region if it is not resolved. While agreeing on the forthcoming  talks, Pakistan had asked India to end the siege of Hazratbal  Shrine and stop human rights violations in occupied Kashmir to  make the secretaries-level talks meaningful. Our correspondent  says though the siege of Hazratbal Shrine was lifted on the 16th  of last month, the flagrant human right violations have been  continuing unabated.    Foreign Office sources say Pakistan wishes to reiterate that  continuing escalation of repression by the Indian troops and  paramilitary forces in Jammu and Kashmir is a source of most  serious concern and anguish for the people and the government of  Pakistan. During the talks, the sources said, the Pakistani side  would urge India to concede to the wishes of the people of  Kashmir and grant them their inalienable right of  self-determination -- a promise it had made but denied to them  since 1947.    The Foreign Office spokesman said Pakistan will find it  extremely difficult to continue this sterile process of dialogue  if India fails to respond to the aspirations of the people of  Kashmir. If there is no progress, Pakistan would take the  matter before the international community and tell the world to  resolve the explosive situation, the spokesman added.    In the light of the secretary-level talks between Pakistan  and India on Kashmir, the members of the Kashmir Committee of  the National Assembly and prominent Kashmiri leaders were  briefed about the government's position. Foreign Minister  Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali told the committee members that Pakistan's  stand on Kashmir had always been clear. It supports Kashmiris'  right to self-determination and their ongoing struggle for this  inalienable right. Pakistan wants the implementation of the UN  resolutions on Kashmir because it understands that peace in the  region will remain elusive unless this dispute is resolved. The  chairman of the National Assembly's Kashmir Committee, Nawabzada  Nasrullah Khan; the president and prime minister of AJK [Azad  Jammu and Kashmir]; president of the People's Party of AJK;  President of Muslim League of AJK; President of Liberation  League of AJK; and acting president of the Jammu and Kashmir  Liberation Front attended the briefing.    President Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari has described the  Pakistan-India foreign secretary-level talks scheduled on Sunday  in Islamabad as a step to find out a political and amicable  solution to the decades-long Kashmir issue. Talking to newsmen  in Akora Khattak, the president said this is a political forum  available to us and we want to use it. Pakistan wants that the  Kashmiris should be given their birthright of self-determination  in accordance with the resolutions adopted by the United  Nations. Pakistan has always condemned Indian brutalities  against the innocent Kashmiris and it would continue to extend  moral and political support to them. President Leghari regretted  that Indian atrocities have reached their peak and there is no  precedence of such brutalities in the entire history of mankind.  He said the strength of the Indian forces has crossed the  figure of 500,000 in occupied Kashmir. The president said the  world pressure on India for a peaceful solution of the Kashmir  issue is also building up.     "

Mr Kinkel said the contact group, led yesterday by the heads of the political directorates, must find a way to 'bring the Bosnian Serbs on board' and accept the peace plan already agreed by the Bosnian Croats and Moslems. He said time was running out as Washington was considering lifting the arms embargo, and there was pressure from Russia to lift sanctions imposed on Serbia now that President Slobodan Milosevic had apparently severed economic ties with the Bosnian Serbs. Mr Kinkel added that he remained disapppointed that Mr Milosevic had still not agreed to allow United Nations observers to monitor the border between Serbia and eastern Bosnia.

Mr Joubran Kourieh, Syrian spokesman, said President Hafez al-Assad had reiterated that a settlement had to be based on UN resolutions calling for total Israeli withdrawal from occupied Arab lands. 'President Assad was briefed by Mr Christopher on the outcome of his talks in Israel which showed the differences were still big because Israel's position was still far from the basis and requirements of the peace process which began in Madrid,' Mr Kourieh added. Mr Christopher and his entourage kept the secretary of state's pledge on arriving in the region four days ago that observers would be 'disappointed' by what he could reveal of the content of his meetings. This silence is taken in Damascus as a clear sign of the substantive nature of his proxy negotiations between Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, and President Assad with whom Mr Christopher held a further four hours of talks yesterday. Syrian officials said only that the two sides are now talking about 'core issues' of a peace agreement. Mr Christopher is understood to have exchanged what one diplomat described as 'very, very detailed position papers on both sides.' Mr Christopher's central task is to bridge the differences between Israel, which has so far offered a phased and partial withdrawal from the Golan over five to eight years, and Syria, which wants nothing less than a full withdrawal over a 'reasonable' timetable. Diplomats in Damascus say Mr Assad would accept withdrawal over a maximum of three years, but only after an initial pledge from Israel of Syrian sovereignty over the whole area occupied in 1967.

Police Chief of Staff General Percival Adiong  said the killing of Mabilangan would be thoroughly investigated.  He said the murder would affect peace talks between communist  rebels and the government. Doctors said Mabilangan had three  gunshot wounds, under his head, face, and neck.    Meantime, Malacanang [presidential office] condemned the  killing of Comrade Hector Mabilangan, saying it can set back the  government's search for peace.

During a one-day visit to Belgrade, Lord Owen made what many observers see as a final attempt to persuade Mr Milosevic to bring Bosnian Serb leaders to heel and support the plan, brokered by Mr Cyrus Vance and himself, to divide Bosnia into 10 provinces, roughly along ethnic lines. After a 2 1/2 -hour session behind closed doors, Mr Fred Eckhard, spokesman for the mediators, admitted little hope remained that Serb leaders would drop their opposition to the plan. He said: 'I don't want to say last chance, but there's a particular pressure now on everybody to see if something can't be pulled out at the last minute.' Lord Owen also held two rounds of talks with President Dobrica Cosic of the rump Yugoslavia. State-run Serbian media attacked Lord Owen for his calls for foreign air strikes against Serbian targets. But yesterday he did not publicly repeat his threats of military action. Mr Eckhard, admitting the failure to overcome fierce Serb objections to the plan, said: 'If the Serbs say 'no' as they have done today, they have no option really but to turn it over to the Security Council.' The Vance-Owen plan demands considerable concessions from Bosnian Serbs. They currently control 70 per cent of the territory of Bosnia-Hercegovina, but have been allocated 43 per cent of its land surface under the mediators' proposed peace settlement, which has already been signed by the Bosnian Croats and Moslems. Serb leaders remained defiant even on the eve of additional punitive measures from the international community. More economic sanctions are due to come into effect on Monday which would virtually isolate Serbia and Montenegro from the outside world, if Bosnian Serbs fail to endorse the plan. Lord Owen also had a secret meeting with Mr Radovan Karadzic, but the result of their talks has not been disclosed. Mr Karadzic was quoted by Tanjug news agency as telling reporters in the Bosnian town of Zvornik that the Bosnian Serb parliament would meet on Friday and Saturday to discuss whether to accept or reject the Vance-Owen plan. Asked whether the assembly would quit the peace talks, Mr Karadzic said: 'I am convinced that our parliament will decide in that direction because it is really not our duty to co-operate with those who are punishing us.' Lord Owen yesterday also met Croat military leaders in an attempt to arrange a ceasefire between Croat and Moslems forces in central Bosnia.

The interconnector, blown up on several occasions by the IRA in the 1970s cutting the province from the Irish grid, has become a symbol of the drive at cross-border co-operation on the back of the peace process. Following the IRA ceasefire on August 31, NIE has been in 'active discussions' with Ireland's Electricity Supply Board to agree the technical and commercial terms for supplying the south with power. Both companies say it will be relatively easy. All-island co-operation in areas such as energy, telecommunications and tourism are likely to increase in the wake of any durable political settlement for the province, as companies - public and private - look for cost savings. Just in the last week, the NIE and ESB have commissioned two cross-border emergency connections in the north-west of the province, an 'energy-poor' area. The project attracted support from a European Commission scheme. The north-south interconnector is also likely to win support from the European Union. Northern Ireland is due to launch a public inquiry on January 10 into the planned undersea link with Scottish Power. The NIE has a 15-year supply agreement with Scottish Power. Northern Ireland has allocated Ecu177m (Pounds 140m) of EU funds towards the scheme. NIE, Northern Ireland's largest company, said yesterday that the interconnector with the republic could be working again within five months. Agreement will also have to be sought on pricing, and other trading issues, once a study of demand is complete. 'It is not a massive project, but it has come to be seen as a political issue. We want to look at it as a simple commercial question,' NIE said. The company has four power stations, with total capacity of 2,300MW, which is 40 per cent higher than peak needs. A link with the south would enable it to meet ESB's projected increased energy demand. In addition, as a result of the one- hour difference in peak load times, a link would help lower consumer costs in the province by improving capacity efficiency.

The visit appears to be smoothing the way for a possible decision on a withdrawal of the troops, just five weeks ahead of an informal deadline set by Mr Hurd for such a decision. British officials yesterday stressed that the fact-finding visit, which has replaced a visit to Greece, had come at Mr Hurd's own initiative and had only been surrounded by secrecy for security reasons. The officials denied that a decision had already been taken about the troops, and stressed that a withdrawal would depend on the current peace talks in Geneva. However, pessimism about the prospects for peace prevailed in Geneva after a day of bilateral talks among the heads of the three warring communities and separate meetings with Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, the international mediators. Without concealing their contempt for their Moslem adversaries, Serb leaders last night said they were close to cementing an alliance with their Croat counterparts. Such a union would amount to a Serb-Croat carve-up of Bosnia, leaving the Moslems without a homeland. They also indicated that they would renege on their promise to surrender land if Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic failed to endorse an agreement on the republic's partition. Mr Radovan Karadzic, Bosnian Serb leader, accused his Moslem foes of wanting 'more war' by posing new demands. In closed-door meetings, the Serbian delegation raised the stakes by threatening to proclaim as permanent the current borders of their self-styled state, which, after 22 months of war, comprises 70 per cent of Bosnia. In a scathing indictment, Mr Haris Silajdzic, the Bosnian prime minister, described the partition talks as 'futile', accusing the international community of 'supporting fascist aggression' on Bosnia at the expense of a 'multicultural, multi-ethnic state' The toughened stance, suggesting that they do not take seriously the threats of Nato air strikes against Serbian targets, was agreed at a session of the Serbian 'parliament' on Monday in Bosnia. UN officials said yesterday that Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, had asked Mr Yasushi Akashi, his special envoy in former Yugoslavia, to draft concrete plans to open up the airport in Tuzla, the biggest Bosnian stronghold, in an effort to renew pressure on the Bosnian Serbs. Mr Akashi also said yesterday he had not ruled out the use of air power, as threatened last week at the Nato summit. But a diplomat admitted air strikes were not 'high on the agenda at this time'.

The changes to 16 portfolios were aimed at closing the gap between the government and parliament, which have had a fractious relationship since parliamentary elections in November 1993. The key portfolios of information, foreign affairs and finance were not, however, affected. But by appointing a number of MPs to cabinet posts Mr Abdel Salam al-Majali, the prime minister, had hoped to soften rising dissatisfaction against his policies of peace and economic adjustment in the lower house. A number of leading politicians including members of the fundamentalist Islamic Action Front (IAF), nevertheless refused to join. The IAF, which holds the largest bloc of 16 seats in the 80-member parliament, is opposed to Jordan's participation in the peace process which has reached a crucial stage. On Tuesday, Jordan agreed with Israel to push ahead with items on its common agenda, signed in Washington last year. If successful this may include resolving key issues such as territorial and water disputes over the next few months. Mr Jawad Anani, the Jordanian information minister, said that as a result of new developments in the peace process, Jordan must 'mobilise all our energies and unite'. The regime's failure to persuade the Islamists and other influential figures to join the government, however, is likely to mean that tension between parliament and cabinet will continue. Despite this, King Hussein said he was pleased with the new government and hoped that the Lower House and cabinet would work together constructively towards peace.

In comments made less than 48 hours before a decision on the  ban is due, Downing Street officials said they hoped a visa  would not be given to Mr Adams unless he made ""a clear and  unequivocal renunciation of violence."" It was ""deeds not words""  that were required, the officials emphasised. They said the  government had been ""in discussion"" with the U.S. on the subject.    The signal came as the IRA left fire bombs at three stores  in  Oxford Street, London's busiest shopping street, in what was  believed to be the first mainland terrorist action of the year.    Yesterday also saw Northern Ireland's first sectarian  murders  of 1994 when a Roman Catholic man was shot dead as he slept in  Belfast. A second man was killed at Ballymena and a third was  shot dead in Donaghadee, County Down.    The attacks came on the eve of the first session of the  Anglo-Irish inter-governmental conference since the two  governments unveiled their joint peace initiative in December.    The conference is likely to provide the opportunity for both  governments to reaffirm their joint position on the peace  initiative.    A display of unity over the progress of the political talks  coordinated by Mr Michael Ancram, the Northern Ireland minister,  may be harder to engineer. London has indicated that it intends  to act, as promised, to give focus to the talks fairly soon,  although this may come in bilateral and private sessions.  Dublin is anxious not to divert attention from the peace  process.    Mr Adams recently applied for a visa at the American Embassy  in Dublin after receiving an invitation to attend a conference  in New York on Monday [31 January].    Under U.S. immigration law, he is still officially  ineligible  for a visa but a waiver can be issued by the attorney general on  recommendation from Mr Warren Christopher, the secretary of  state.    It is understood that President Bill Clinton has been  involved in the decision-making process and that a series of  meetings took place in Washington on Wednesday. A number of  Irish-American politicians have lobbied on Mr Adams' behalf.    The leaders of the Ulster Unionists and the hardline  Democratic Unionist party [DUP] have already declined an  invitation to attend the conference.    The Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the DUP, yesterday told the  organisers that he would not attend a meeting ""designed to give  credibility and legitimacy to the apologist for IRA murder."" Mr  John Hume, leader of the mainly Catholic Social Democratic and  Labour party, and Dr John Alderdice, leader of the Alliance  party, are expected to attend.     "

Hours after parliament voted 91-3 in favour of the Israeli-Jordanian declaration three Israeli fighter jets escorted King Hussein's low-flying aircraft on an unprecedented flight through the Jewish state's airspace. In an effort to gain maximum support for the declaration Mr Rabin assured parliament Israel would maintain its sovereignty over Jerusalem, despite recognising King Hussein special role over the holy city's Islamic sites. Opposition right-wing parties, which fiercely oppose the peace accord with Palestinians and any withdrawal from the Golan Heights in peace talks with Syria, supported the Jordanian agreement. 'We are in a rare moment in the people's unity in which the opposition is also in support of the government's political moves,' Mr Benjamin Netanyahu, leader of the right-wing Likud party said. King Hussein's flight yesterday was the first official passage of a Jordanian aircraft through Israeli airspace since the creation of the Jewish state in 1948. It was timed to mark parliament's endorsement of the accord and to symbolise the new era of normal relations developing rapidly between the two countries. Next Monday King Hussein and Mr Rabin will meet on their Red Sea border to open a new crossing.

During the  visit, the king will meet with His Majesty Sultan Qabus  Bin-Sa'id. On Wednesday [23 March], the king will head for Doha  on a visit to Qatar to meet with His Highness Shaykh Hamad  Bin-Khalifah Al Thani.    King Husayn will be accompanied, during this tour, by an  official delegation including Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam  al-Majali, Royal Court Chief al-Sharif Zayd Bin-Shakir, and a  number of advisers and ministers.    Yesterday, the king met with Nasir Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz,  ambassador of the State of Qatar in Amman, and reviewed with him  the fraternal ties and the current Arab situation.    Information Minister Jawad al-'Anani said that King Husayn's  visit to Oman and Qatar comes within the framework of the  fraternal ties between Jordanian and these two countries. In a  statement to AL-RA'Y, Dr. al-'Anani said: Jordan has called for  a review of the nature of inter-Arab relations, which must be  based on mutual respect, and for restoring these relations apart  from the impact of the oil era and the misinterpretation of the  Jordanian stand during the Gulf war. He added that Jordan has  explained its position many times.    Dr. al-'Anani noted that Jordanian-Qatari relations have  witnessed significant improvement since the Gulf war, adding  that the joint economic agreement has been renewed and many  agreements in the fields of education, trade exchange, and  information have been revived.    Regarding relations with Oman, Dr. al-'Anani said that our  bilateral relations are cordial and fraternal, noting that  coordination between the two countries has never stopped.    The information minister spoke about Jordan's international  role with regard to its forces taking part in UN peacekeeping  missions. He said that this role will develop with time due to  increasing respect for the reputation of these forces because of  their high efficiency, capability, and discipline.    Dr. al-'Anani said the decision to suspend the peace talks  was made after coordination among the Arab delegations following  the massacre of the Ibrahimi Mosque. He noted that the massacre  has spoiled the general atmosphere of the talks and underscored  basic issues that must be raised before continuing the talks,  the most important of which is the security of the Palestinians.  He said that the decision to return to the negotiating table  will be made after coordination with these states.    Dr. al-'Anani said that Jordan has always called for an end  to the human rights violations perpetrated by Israel against the  Palestinians, noting that these practices contradict the peace  process.    The information minister reiterated the need for continuous  consultation between Jordan and the PLO, noting that His Majesty  King Husayn has always stressed this. He added that the king  also stressed that consultation and coordination should be held  within the framework of the peace process itself, not the  post-peace stages.     "

The document analyzes  the problems with the demarcation of the border, which runs from  Hammat Gader in the north to Elat in the south, through the  Jordan and al-Yarmukh Rivers and the 'Arava. The  Israeli-Jordanian border has never been demarcated by mutual  consent, either on maps on in the field. Its current  configuration is based on general descriptions dating back to  the time of the British mandate. The joint agenda of the talks  stipulates that the border will be demarcated taking these  descriptions into consideration.    The study depicts numerous problems involved in the  demarcation of the border (which runs through the center of the  Jordan River and the Dead Sea) due to changes in the river flow  and the lake's size, and raises questions such as determining  the sovereignty over small islands in the Jordan River.    Jordan has various claims from Israel concerning the  borders,  first and foremost, to get back areas in the 'Arava occupied by  Israel after the Six-Day War. Jordan has been pressuring Israel  to discuss the demarcation of the border, posing it as a  condition for progress in the peace talks. Jordan has not yet  submitted a detailed account of its demands in the framework of  the Washington talks.    A debate about joint development projects in the 'Arava is  scheduled to be held in the next meeting of the joint Israeli-  Jordanian-U.S. economic committee. Although Israel and Jordan  have been discussing joint projects, the Jordanians demand to  discuss the demarcation of the border first, because those  projects are slated for the border area.    Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has instructed the Israeli  delegation to the talks with Jordan not to discuss the border  issue before the Jordanians agree to engage in serious  discussions on the formulation of a peace treaty between the two  countries.

0,FT944-4190 ,"FT944-4190 _AN-ELIDCADYFT 941209   FT  09 DEC 94 / The peace prize: Investment in N Ireland could benefit Britain      By STEWART DALBY   As Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, addresses the international investment conference in Northern Ireland next Wednesday, he will almost certainly be aware that Britain could reap considerable dividends from peace in the province. The UK exchequer currently subsidises Northern Ireland to the tune of Pounds 3.5bn annually. This is the net subvention after taxes and other receipts, and excludes the direct costs of the British army presence, which could add a further Pounds 500m to the bill. In total, the province is costing UK taxpayers the equivalent of about 2p on income tax. Government spending per head of Northern Ireland's 1.6m population is about 50 per cent higher than for the UK as a whole. Security does not account for all of this difference. Public spending per head is also higher in industry, agriculture, health and education. Subsidies to these areas, with spending on security deducted, accounts for approximately 20 per cent of the province's gross domestic product of nearly Pounds 12bn. The evidence of such large subsidies is manifest. The modern port at Larne is considered more efficient than Dublin's, and handles much of the Republic's exports. Some of the new housing estates in inner-city areas rate among the best in the UK. The transport system is heavily subsidised, and the capacity of the province's road network far exceeds traffic needs. The province also receives money from the European Union, under the Objective 1 programme, targeted at areas on Europe's fringes with per capita income of less than 75 per cent of the EU average. The province is due to receive Pounds 1bn between 1994 and 1999 from EU structural funds under this programme. Objective 1 finance paid for a recent expansion of Belfast International Airport, which is now handling 2.3m passengers a year on direct flights to 11 destinations. It also funded the installation of electricity on Rathlin Island, the only inhabited island in the province. The moves towards peace are generating further aid commitments. EU leaders are expected to agree new aid to bolster the peace plan at today's Essen summit. These peace grants could total Ecu300m (Pounds 233m) between 1995 and 1999. Mr John Hume, leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party, has been a tireless and successful fundraiser for Northern Ireland. He was instrumental in setting up the multinational International Fund for Ireland, which promotes cross-border co-operation with the Republic of Ireland. This fund has drawn contributions from the US as well as the EU, and now stands at Dollars 150m. Sir George Quigley, former permanent secretary at the finance department of the Northern Ireland Office and now chairman of Ulster Bank, defends the level of spending, claiming that in Northern Ireland special factors are at work. 'Given the unique situation here with sectarian divisions, and employment problems it has been necessary to spend money to achieve a degree of stabilisation. It is important to try and mop up unemployment.' In education, for example, extra spending is needed to fund three different kinds of schools: church schools, predominantly Protestant state schools and non-sectarian state schools, he says. He also points out, as do many others, that Northern Ireland has the best A-level results in the UK. Spending on health and hospitals has been necessary not just because of the violence, he says, but also because Belfast and Londonderry have suffered from inner-city deprivation, leading to higher than average levels of ill-health. However, Sir George concedes that Northern Ireland has become a largely public sector economy - described by many commentators as a dependency culture. Forty per cent of those in work are employed by the public sector, double the UK average. In particular, the security industries have been an important provider of jobs, especially for Protestants, with 12,000 full- and part-time members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary. There are also 6,300 full- and part-time members of the locally recruited Royal Irish Regiment. Jobs in the police mean income and mortgages and money pumped into local economies. And Northern Ireland has the highest level of unemployment in the UK. Its traditional industries such as shipbuilding, engineering and textiles have been in long-term decline, with manufacturing accounting for 18 per cent of employment. The violence created difficulties in attracting outside investment, and inward investment has been drawn only through the liberal use of grants. This year the Industrial Development Board for Northern Ireland will spend Pounds 148m in attracting new investment, in one of the most expensive job creation schemes in the UK. However, the alternative - unemployment - has also placed a heavy burden on government spending. At 12.7 per cent, the jobless rate in Northern Ireland reflects the higher proportion of women in the labour force than in the rest of the UK. But it has also been exacerbated by the birth rate, which is the highest in western Europe - higher even than the Republic of Ireland. This has generated a constant stream of young entrants to the labour market, even after allowing for emigration. Against this background, Sir George estimates that a lasting peace could mean a loss of 20,000 jobs, which would be a considerable addition to the 100,000 already out of work. Ultimately, peace will mean a reduction of the public sector's role. Of course, the job losses would not happen all at once; the dependency would not end overnight; and Mr Major cannot expect to cut the public bill very quickly. In the longer term, employment is likely to be created in a revived tourism industry and from closer integration with the Republic, but it will not compensate for jobs lost in the public sector unless there is considerable inward investment. Hence next week's conference.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P9532 Urban and Community Development.     P9611 Administration of General Economic Programs.

0,FT944-14551 ,"FT944-14551 _AN-EJWA8ABFFT 941022   FT  22 OCT 94 / Ulster Peace Process: Sinn Fein aims to unite in unarmed struggle - Hardline elements could still jeopardise the ceasefire      By JIMMY BURNS   An early public reaction from Sinn Fein vice president Mr Martin McGuinness yesterday gave a broad welcome to Mr John Major's announcement as a further step towards peace. 'A move in the right direction. It is quite clear we must build up on all this,' he said. However, intentions notwithstanding, there is no certainty yet that the latest measures will banish for ever the prospect of a resumption of IRA violence. This was the view yesterday of republican insiders who are sensitive to the strains within Sinn Fein and the IRA after the IRA organisation's ceasefire declaration seven weeks ago. In the coming days, the Sinn Fein leadership will aim to reassure rank and file republicans that Mr Major's announcements show there is political advantage to be gained from a cessation of violence. What Sinn Fein leaders have dubbed the 'unarmed phase of the struggle' has paved the way for a reopening of border crossings, the prospect of exploratory talks with the British government by Christmas and the lifting of exclusion orders on Mr McGuinness and Mr Gerry Adams, the party's president. These measures have been high on the list of republican demands since the ceasefire. But the Sinn Fein leadership realises that it has to continue to be seen to be gaining political ground in the coming weeks if it is to contain the restlessness of hardline elements linked to the IRA. If and when it comes to talks with the government it will aim to secure further concessions from the British government. At the same time it will seek to avoid taking any further unilateral moves towards demilitarisation which may risk a damaging split within the republican movement. While the IRA refuses to hand its armoury over, British intelligence is trying to keep a close watch on the movements of suspected terrorists. And while some IRA 'volunteers' are thought to be enjoying a period of peace, others remain determined not to allow their military efficiency to be weakened by the peace process. The IRA may not be bombing, but its capacity to bomb is firmly intact. Within republican circles, there has been some optimistic talk - both before and since the IRA ceasefire - of a new, strengthened nationalist consensus emerging from the current peace process. At the same time, there is a sceptical view that the British government is stringing the IRA along, holding out olive branches while aiming to undermine the republican movement both politically and militarily. Writing in the latest issue of the influential Irish political magazine Fortnight, former IRA political prisoner Mr Anthony McIntyre says: 'The ceasefire has come and gone, and the British have not gone . . . while an imaginative step by the republican leadership, it will be a major achievement for them to avoid this ceasefire being more disastrous than the last. The lesson of history is simple: prolonged ceasefire sounds the death knell for republican struggle.' For the moment, there is little indication of the republican leadership abandoning its public commitment to the peace process. Both Mr Adams and Mr McGuinness are thought to still be holding the IRA army council to the belief that any resumption of violence in the immediate future would torpedo the chances of talks before Christmas. But it is widely recognised that the next stage of the process will severely test the limits of republican patience. In his public appearances in recent weeks, Mr Adams has noticeably been increasing his demands for a withdrawal of British troops. He has also been uncompromising on the question of consent, rejecting the unionist position that Northern Ireland's future should be settled by the people of the province. After yesterday, the stage may be set for early talks between Sinn Fein and the government. But republicans are gearing up for some hard bargaining from which they expect results not defeats.

SHAMIR WALKS OUT OF PARTY MEETING.      By DANIEL WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER      TEL AVIV      Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir walked out of a chaotic meeting of his  Likud Party on Monday after a verbal brawl with hawkish rival Ariel Sharon, who  surprised everyone by quitting his Cabinet post to protest developing peace  talks.    During the meeting, Shamir sought a vote of confidence in his leadership while  Sharon tried to drum up votes to block compromises in peace negotiations.    Sharon demanded that the Palestinian uprising come to an end before talks begin  and that the talks be barred to Palestinians expelled from Israel and Arab  residents of East Jerusalem. Both men tried to have their way -- at the same  time -- by shouting into microphones and calling for the party's 3,000 Central  Committee members to vote.    ""You must confirm me in my work. That's my resolution to the Central  Committee,"" the bantam-sized Shamir called out as he peered over the podium.  Hands in the audience started going up.    ""Who is in favor of wiping out terror? I ask the committee,"" began the portly  Sharon, leaning into his own mike.    The crowd, gathered in a Tel Aviv exhibition hall, roared. It was difficult to  say just who was supporting whom, although Sharon supporters set off loud  chants of ""Arik! Arik!"" -- Sharon's nickname.    ""Please sit down,"" Shamir told Sharon. ""Democracy will decide who has faith in  me, who has confidence.""    ""Who is in favor of excluding deportees? Raise your hands,"" commanded Sharon,  who until Monday was minister of trade and industry.    ""Ah, nonsense! Vote only on this resolution. . . !"" yelled Shamir, thrusting a  finger into the air.    ""Who is in favor of excluding East Jerusalem Arabs?"" Sharon asked loudly.    The crowd was on its feet, booing and cheering all at once. Each contestant  declared himself the winner. Shamir adjourned the meeting and trudged off the  dais, circled by grim-faced security agents and trailed by a flock of his  Cabinet ministers. Sharon's backers taunted the 74-year-old prime minister with  hisses and calls of ""Coward! Coward!""    Sharon slapped down his memo pad, stayed on the speakers' platform and was  joined by allies from the audience.    Did Shamir get a hands-up vote of confidence and end the meeting before  Sharon's attack? Were the shouts in answer to Sharon's resolutions a defeat for  the prime minister? It was like a bout the World Boxing Assn. might rule on.    By offering his resignation, the 61-year-old Sharon shed responsibility for  Cabinet decisions and can now focus on undermining Shamir's leadership in  Likud, party observers said. Sharon himself hinted as much: ""I decided to  resign from the government to continue my struggle for reaching our national  objectives, which are now endangered as a result of the government's policy.""    Sharon, a former defense minister who led Israel into the 1982 Lebanon war,  claimed that he told Shamir of his resignation by letter Sunday. Shamir said he  knew nothing about it until the meeting got under way, and there was no  indication that he had accepted it.    The meeting, called by Sharon and two other hawkish Cabinet ministers from the  Likud Party, attracted wide attention because of its possible impact on efforts  to arrange Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.    U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III has proposed a meeting with the  foreign ministers of Israel and Egypt to work out a list of Palestinian  participants. The chosen Palestinian panel and the Israelis would discuss  Shamir's plan to hold elections in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.    For the past seven months, the peace effort has stalled over which Palestinians  will take part. Participation would either be limited to residents of the  occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip or would also include East Jerusalemites as  well as Palestinians who have been expelled by Israel.    Israel is wary that Palestinians-in-exile will front for the Palestine  Liberation Organization, which is based in Tunisia. Many Israelis believe that  if Jerusalem Arabs take part, the talks might throw into question the country's  hold on its own capital.    In his speech, which kicked off the meeting, Sharon expressed a lack of  confidence in Shamir. ""Under your government,"" he said, turning toward the  prime minister, ""Palestinian terror runs wild within the land of Israel and  causes heavy losses to innocent Jews and Arabs."" Sharon made a pitch for a  tougher crackdown on the uprising, as well as for Israel to keep all the  occupied land.    Israeli soldiers have killed 600 Palestinians during the intifada, or uprising.  Another 160 Arabs died at the hands of Palestinians themselves, mainly on  suspicion of collaborating with Israeli authorities. Forty Israelis have been  killed by Palestinians in Israel and the disputed land.    Last week, two terrorists shot up and threw grenades into a tourist bus in  Egypt and killed nine Israelis on board. Israeli officials say the killers were  Palestinians expelled from Israel during the past five years.    In a head-to-head battle with Sharon, Shamir appears to have the upper hand.

Mr Reynolds confirmed earlier that he would answer Mr  Adams's  request for clarification of the document he signed with Prime  Minister John Major in London last month.    But the Irish premier also made clear he could add little to  a series of public speeches he made about the peace initiative  and its aims.    Mr Reynolds has sought to spell out the aims of the joint  Anglo-Irish statement on a number of occasions in a bid to  provoke a positive response from the IRA and its Sinn Fein  allies.    So far, though, the hardline republican movement has  restricted itself to continuing consultations about the document  with its membership.    Sinn Fein-staged public meetings on the issue are set to  continue throughout Ireland until the middle of next month,  ahead of the party's annual conference in Dublin.    In his reply to Mr Adams -- who sent a similar letter to Mr  Major -- Mr Reynolds is understood to have spelled out the  consequences of an end to the IRA terror campaign.    This is thought to have centred on the timing of exploratory  talks with Sinn Fein as part of the political process bid to  resolve the issue of Northern Ireland.    Since the December 15 signing of the peace statement, Dublin  has been more willing than London to move towards clarification  of the document, while stopping well short of any form of  renegotiation.    But in Dublin on Friday [28 January], after a meeting of the  Anglo-Irish intergovernmental Northern Ireland Conference,  Ulster Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew appeared to suggest that he,  too, would clarify some of the issues.    Deputy Irish premier and Foreign Minister Dick Spring, who  jointly chaired the conference session, today said every  opportunity to spell out the aims of the peace declaration had  to be taken.    He believed all the neccessary clarification was in the  ""carefully and well-thought-out document,"" but stressed: ""We are  not going to foreclose on the prospect for peace on this island.""     "
0,FT943-10053 ,"FT943-10053 _AN-EHHDNAA3FT 940808   FT  08 AUG 94 / US tries to calm Mideast tensions      By JULIAN OZANNE      JERUSALEM   Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, tried to calm tensions between Syria and Israel yesterday after a weekend surge of violence on the Israeli-Lebanese border overshadowed his current Middle East peace shuttle. The renewal of Arab-Israeli violence comes in spite of dramatic recent peace moves between Israel and its neighbours, crowned today by the opening of a new Red Sea border between Israel and Jordan. Pro-Iranian Lebanese guerrillas of the Hizbollah killed two Israeli soldiers at the weekend in Israel's self-declared security zone in southern Lebanon and fired salvos of rockets into northern Israel which slightly wounded three children. The Hizbollah attacks came after Israeli jets bombed an apartment building in south Lebanon on Thursday killing seven people. Israel and Syria yesterday traded accusations. Syria said Israel had stepped up its military attacks in south Lebanon in order to sabotage Mr Christopher's efforts to break a deadlock in Israeli-Syrian peace talks. 'The escalation in south Lebanon is a firm proof that Israel is trying to direct a severe blow to the US efforts aimed at rescuing the peace process,' said the official Syrian daily Tishreen. 'The one who wants peace does not kill peace with bombardment and does not resort to destruction and massacres.' Israel earlier accused Syria of not preventing attacks by Hizbollah in southern Lebanon. 'It is clear the Syrians, if they want, are able to influence the Lebanese government to constrain the activities of Hizbollah,' said Gen Ehud Barak, Israeli army chief. 'Unfortunately, they don't want to do it until now. As long as they are not doing it we are determined to keep fighting.' Mr Christopher met Mr Rabin and Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, in Jerusalem before flying to Damascus yesterday where he held five hours of talks with President Hafez al-Assad of Syria. In Jerusalem, he said he had intervened to prevent an escalation of violence which 'underscores the need for a peaceful resolution of these problems'. Despite the hostilities he remained cautiously optimistic about making incremental progress in stalled Israeli-Syrian peace talks, which focus on a return of the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights in return for peace. Israeli officials said Mr Christopher was pursuing possible detailed scenarios of the timetable and phases of an Israeli withdrawal from the Golan and what security measures, such as demilitarisation, would be taken at what stage. Publicly, however, Syria insisted that there would be no progress until Israel stated clearly that it would withdraw fully from the Heights. Mr Christopher will attend an Israeli-Jordanian border ceremony today, 3.5km north of Eilat.   Countries:-  ILZ  Israel, Middle East.     SYZ  Syria, Middle East.     USZ  United States of America.

It raised a premeditated hue and cry over the  'Afula operation in order to cover up two serious crimes it  recently committed: The holy Ibrahimi Mosque massacre and the  subsequent Israeli Army killings, and the Zionist special  forces' execution of six Palestinians in the Jabaliya camp. The  latter was described by world circles at the time as the most  serious violation of human rights in the occupied Arab  territories. Israel also imposed a military siege on our people  in the West Bank and Gaza Strip under the pretext of providing  security to its Jewish inhabitants.    Security, as all know, cannot be provided under occupation.  If Israel was really concerned about security, it would have  accepted the Security Council resolutions governing the peace  process and it would have negotiated on that basis in a way that  leads to the withdrawal of its forces and settlers from occupied  Arab territory and to the establishment of an independent  Palestinian state where people can live a free and honorable  life. But Israel does not want to withdraw from the occupied  territories. The flimsy security pretext it uses to confront  the world will not stand up to the test. The Israeli occupation  is a source of danger to the Israelis themselves and the very  reason of the lack of security. The more the occupation steps  up its bestial acts, the more resistance escalates and violence  aggravates.    The Arabs have taken part in the Madrid conference and  presented objective proposals in the Washington talks for the  sake of establishing a real, just, and comprehensive peace  because only a just and comprehensive peace based on the  international community resolutions, charters, and principles  can provide security and stability in the region and end the  cycle of violence. Instead of responding to Arab proposals,  particularly the Syrian ones, Israel continued its maneuvers and  prevarications in a bid to avoid the principles on which the  peace process was based. These principles are land for peace,  namely, full Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Arab  territories as stipulated by the UN resolutions.    The Israeli rulers refuse to admit facts. They turn a blind  eye to developments and try to delude themselves into believing  that it is possible to achieve peace through the continuation of  occupation. If they think so, they will undoubtedly reap further  bitter fruit. Peace and occupation cannot coexist. There can be  no peace in the Middle East without full Israeli withdrawal from  all the occupied territories and without the realization of the  Palestinian people's real hopes and aspirations, led by freedom,  dignity, and self- determination.    Only a just and comprehensive peace can provide security and  stability. A just and comprehensive peace should be based on  specific international resolutions that should be implemented in  full and lead to Israel's withdrawal from every inch of the  occupied territories. Otherwise, not one Israeli will enjoy  peace or security.     "

Can you explain to us the progress that has been  achieved so far?    ['Arafat] True, we have almost reached a final agreement  during my meeting with Mr. Peres in Davos and we are very close  to signing an agreement which can be called the Davos agreement.  The Israelis, however, need a few more days before ratifying  the agreement. I will meet again with Mr. Peres and [Israeli  Prime Minister] Mr. Rabin in Cairo.    [Cochlaine] What about control over the border crossing  points with Jordan and access to the Dead Sea?    ['Arafat] We discussed these topics at length and we are now  discussing the details. I cannot say anything further at this  point.    [Cochlaine] You made concessions, for instance, over the  size of the self-rule area around Jericho--from 340 square km to  55 square km. Are you willing to make further concessions?    ['Arafat] I reject the term ""concessions"" because the  achievement of peace is more important than anything else. That  is why I speak about ""the peace of the brave."" We will  implement everything that was agreed upon with the Israelis.  Similar negotiations were held between Algeria and France in  the early 1960's and between South Africa's President Frederick  de Klerk and my friend, Nelson Mandela.    [Cochlaine] Do you think the Israelis will withdraw from  Gaza and Jericho on 13 April as agreed in the timetable of the  peace agreement that was signed in 13 September 1993?    ['Arafat] I hope the Israelis will respect the agreement and  redeploy their forces in the territories according to plan.    [Cochlaine] Will there be elections in July?    ['Arafat] I hope the Israelis will not postpone them. Rabin  had stated that there are no sacred dates, but our position is  that the agreements which were signed must be respected and  implemented.    [Cochlaine] What role will the elected council play in  comparison with that of the Palestinian National Authority?  Will there be two government agencies competing with each other?    ['Arafat] The Palestinian National Authority is a permanent  body that was set up by a Palestine National Council [PNC]  resolution in 1974, while the council will be convened for  legislative elections.    [Cochlaine] Does that mean that the council will comprise  PNC members living in the occupied territories?    ['Arafat] Certainly.    [Cochlaine] Late last year, a delegation of 118 PLO members  came to Tunis and handed you a letter, criticizing the PLO's  undemocratic practices and your single-handedness. What is your  comment on this?    ['Arafat] The mere fact that these people were allowed to  level these accusations and criticisms shows that the PLO is a  democratic institution. Would they cling to democracy in any  other organization? We are proud of the fact that we have  established democracy within the PLO, even when our struggle was  in full swing. This accomplishment is unprecedented.    [Cochlaine] Presidents Bill Clinton and Hafiz al-Asad met in  Geneva on 16 January. Do you believe that Israel can conduct  peace negotiations on two tracks; that is, with you and with the  Syrians, at the same time?    ['Arafat] Why not? Israel headed for the Madrid and  Washington negotiations, fully aware that there is no  alternative to a peace agreement between the Arabs and Israelis  in the Middle East. The negotiations on both tracks are heading  in the same direction. At any rate, the PLO's ties with Syria  are good. Only 10 days ago, I took part in the funeral of  Basil, President Hafiz al-Asad's eldest son, who died in a  tragic incident. I also keep in mind the Arab meetings held in  Washington, which will bring us closer to Arab unity.    [Cochlaine] You have recently met with King Fahd in Saudi  Arabia. You have described your meeting with the Saudi monarch  as cordial. Is that all there is to this meeting?    ['Arafat] Our talks were cordial and constructive. I am  grateful to King Fahd for the efforts he has made to achieve  peace in the Middle East. I am also grateful to him for the  support he is extending to the Palestinian people, the Palestine  question, and Arab Jerusalem.    [Cochlaine] What role do you envisage for Switzerland as a  mediator in the Middle East conflict?    ['Arafat] We appreciate the constructive role being  undertaken by Switzerland, which is maintaining good relations  with the Palestinians and Israelis alike, with the Arabs in  general, with the United States, with Russia, and with the  Western European Union. Although Norway was active in the Middle  East peace negotiations last year, the Swiss Confederation has  always played a distinctive role in Middle East affairs.    [Cochlaine] Do you think that you can benefit from the  so-called Swiss model with regard to political cooperation once  federal ties are established between Jordan and the Palestinians?    ['Arafat] You cannot export your unique model of coexistence  among various linguistic and ethnic groups. I wish this was  possible. Nonetheless, the Swiss model of coexistence will be  helpful to us in the Middle East.     "
0,FT934-10986 ,"FT934-10986 _AN-DKCDEABWFT 931103   FT  03 NOV 93 / Major orders review of Sinn Fein broadcasting rules      By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent   MR JOHN MAJOR, the prime minister, yesterday ordered a review of attempts by television stations to circumvent regulations which restrict broadcasts by Sinn Fein spokesmen. Mr Major also confirmed that he will meet the leaders of the four non-violent Northern Ireland parties shortly for a round of bilateral discussions on the peace process. In Belfast police revealed that a man is to be charged in connection with the Hallowe'en massacre of seven people in Greysteel, County Londonderry. A second is likely to be accused of withholding information. Downing Street said Mr Major called for a review of the broadcasting rules after seeing recent interviews with Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing. Mr Major was said to have been disturbed by the use of actors reading synchronised scripts, to get round restrictions preventing transmission of Mr Adams' voice. In the Commons the prime minister told Dame Jill Knight, a Conservative backbencher, that the use of actors 'stretched the present guidelines to the limit, and perhaps beyond'. The review will be carried out by Mr Peter Brooke, the heritage secretary, who has primary responsibility for broadcasting law. Mr Brooke, who is understood to have been given a free hand to recommend any changes he thinks necessary, is expected to consult Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, and Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary. However, he is not expected to bow to demands from Dame Jill and other Conservatives for a ban on all broadcast interviews with Sinn Fein. Downing Street said Mr Major would begin seeing Northern Ireland political leaders tomorrow. The first meetings are expected to be with Dr John Alderdice, leader of the moderate unionist Alliance party, and Mr John Hume, leader of the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party. The prime minister's office is trying to arrange meetings with the Reverend Ian Paisley, leader of the hardline Democratic Unionist party, and Mr James Molyneaux, leader of the Ulster Unionist party, the biggest unionist grouping. The round of meetings is intended to stress Mr Major's availability to all political leaders in Northern Ireland who reject the use of violence. It follows the prime minister's decision to accept a request for a meeting from Mr Hume, who wants to discuss his talks on prospects for peace with Mr Adams. However, the meetings will also allow Mr Major to lay the groundwork for round-table talks at which the government has promised to set out fresh peace proposals. Five men were arrested in connection with the Greysteel massacre yesterday, but two were later released.

The  talks with Federal Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic centered  on the international community's intensive efforts aimed at  finding a peaceful solution to the Yugoslav crisis, the two  countries' contribution in this respect, and certain bilateral  issues.    The Yugoslav side informed its Italian collocutors about the  constructive efforts the FRY is making toward ending the civil  war in Bosnia-Herzegovina as soon as possible by reaching a  peace agreement, with respect for the legitimate interests of  the parties involved.    Voicing support for the new Italian Government's endeavors  to  become more actively involved in the peaceful resolution of the  Yugoslav crisis, the Yugoslav side expressed its hope that Italy  -- a neighboring country and influential member of the European  Union -- will contribute to a principled approach to the crisis.  As Italy will soon be presiding over the summit of the G-7 and  Russia in Naples, hope was expressed that Italy will contribute  to the shaping of a more objective view of a resolution and a  more realistic position regarding the search for a just and  lasting peace.    Special emphasis was laid in the talks on the need for  normalizing relations between the FRY and the CSCE, with the  lifting of the ban on the FRY's activities as the final result.    The Yugoslav side underscored the necessity for lifting the  sanctions, since it has met all the conditions stemming from  relevant UN Security Council resolutions. There is a growing  awareness among international factors that the FRY is actively  engaged in the search for a peaceful solution, while the  sanctions are becoming counterproductive because they are  encouraging the advocates of the war option and rendering peace  talks more difficult. In addition to their dire consequences  for the population and the economy of the FRY, the sanctions are  adversely affecting neighboring countries and the entire  European continent. As a result of the sanctions,  Yugoslav-Italian trade has dropped from several billion dollars  to zero.    The Italian side was informed about the situation in the  Balkan region, relations with neighboring countries, and the  current process of normalizing relations with the former  Yugoslav republics -- something Yugoslavia is sincerely  interested in.    The meeting reaffirmed the traditionally friendly relations  between Yugoslavia and Italy -- relations that are not burdened  by open problems. It was mutually concluded that significant  prospects exist for the revival of all-encompassing bilateral  cooperation after the sanctions are lifted. The conviction was  expressed that the development of such cooperation will in  future be an important impetus to the overall normalization of  economic and political ties in the region of former Yugoslavia.

0,FT944-3963 ,"FT944-3963 _AN-ELLBEACRFT 941210   FT  10 DEC 94 / New tune for Irish reel: Political change has trailed social shifts      By JOHN MURRAY BROWN   Ireland's Fianna Fail, so long seen as the natural party of government, appears to be losing its grip on power. A political scandal involving the party has triggered the break-up of the government that it led, and efforts to rebuild the coalition with the Labour party have foundered. Last night, Fine Gael, the opposition party, was locked in discussions with Labour over a new administration. But in the absence of a strong alternative to Fianna Fail, the chance of stable government in Dublin looks remote. The political crisis in Ireland has been aggravated by the painful adjustment of a conservative, rural country to the new reality of an urbanised existence, underpinned by the sudden advent of prosperity from membership of the European Union. While Irish society has been transformed, the political system has been agonisingly slow to change. The two main political parties, Fianna Fail and Fine Gael, are almost equally conservative - their only serious distinguishing factor is that they were on opposite sides during the Irish civil war. Fianna Fail tends to be more rural and republican in its support and instincts, while the traditional Fine Gael 'blue shirts' are the small tradesmen and middle classes of the little market towns of the Irish countryside. The Labour party, condemned for years to a minority role on the opposition benches, was the only representative of secular European left-right politics. Today Dublin and its suburbs contain more than a third of the country's 3.5m population, after rapid urbanisation that has also caused an upheaval in the traditional political divide. It is an upheaval that could see Fianna Fail and Fine Gael forced into a conservative coalition, a prospect that causes horror to party traditionalists. Above all, it amounts to a seismic shock for Fianna Fail, which has regarded itself as the natural party of government since it was founded by Eamonn de Valera in the 1920s. The party is unashamedly populist, with an extensive grass-roots organisation. During its decades in power, it has used political patronage to reward supporters with civil service appointments. The most recent crisis was triggered when Mr Albert Reynolds, the Taoiseach or prime minister, overruled the objections of his Labour coalition partners to appoint Mr Harry Whelehan, the attorney general, as the Irish High Court president. Labour withdrew from the government and Mr Reynolds resigned as leader of Fianna Fail. But efforts by Mr Bertie Ahern, his successor, to re-establish the coalition foundered this week when new revelations emerged about the extent to which parliament had been misled over the appointment. The political turmoil that has resulted has launched an impassioned debate about official impropriety, and croneyism in public appointments. 'They've always controlled all the jobs,' says one Labour member of parliament, who compares Ireland to the corruption of Latin America. The cause of Mr Whelehan's downfall - his failure to act on a UK extradition warrant for a paedophile Catholic priest - has also raised questions about the role of the church which still exerts an influence over moral and social questions such as education, divorce and abortion. With new charges against the clergy revealed by newspapers almost every day, the church's failure to deal with errant priests has shocked public opinion in the Republic. An alternative coalition may be hard to construct. Fine Gael, the main opposition party, could form a government if it were able to persuade the Labour party and one or both of the minor parties to join it. But while Labour has entered coalitions with Fine Gael before, the latter has adopted a much more free market approach to economic policy that may prove hard for Labour to endorse. There is also bad feeling between the leaders of the two parties: relations between Mr John Bruton of Fine Gael and Labour's Mr Dick Spring were soured when Labour entered government with Fianna Fail following the 1992 election. Last night, a three-party coalition seemed the most likely arrangement, linking Fine Gael and Labour and one of the two smaller parties, Democratic Left and Progressive Democrats. The smaller parties are resisting pressure to enter a four-party coalition, that would reduce their ability to demand concessions. Democratic Left is understood to be the favoured choice of Labour. This left-leaning party is the successor to the Official IRA, from which Provisional IRA split to pursue the armed struggle in 1970. The party would have natural affinities with Labour on welfare questions, and would be more in tune on labour issues. The alternative is the right-wing Progressive Democrats, now led by Ms Mary Harney. A breakaway from Fianna Fail, the PDs would prove more difficult partners for Labour because they are more right-wing than Fine Gael. If a new coalition cannot be formed, the only alternative is a general election, which Labour in particular is concerned to avoid. The party's strategists believe the party would be hard-pressed to repeat its 1992 success, when the party won 32 seats. An election would also bring a protracted period of political uncertainty to the peace process in Northern Ireland. As UK officials began exploratory talks in Belfast yesterday with Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, the absence of a stable government in Dublin could hold up progress. Even if there is an election, there is no guarantee that this will resolve the impasse. The opinion polls suggest that no party is likely to emerge with an overall parliamentary majority. Ireland would be facing exactly the same difficulties over the formation of a coalition in a month's time. Whatever the outcome of the current negotiations, Ireland is moving slowly and painfully towards a more traditional left-right political divide. Strategic thinkers within the parties, like Mr Maurice Manning of Fine Gael, are beginning to think the previously unthinkable: that a conservative coalition may be inevitable. It would mean both Fine Gael and Fianna Fail abandoning their old civil war prejudices. It would also require Fianna Fail, above all, undergoing a thorough cleansing of its secretive, anti-democratic ways. But a transformation of southern Irish politics from sterile old republican rivalries is as much a part of the peace process as negotiations between unionists and republicans in the north.

0,FT944-13875 ,"FT944-13875 _AN-EJZDWAA9FT 941026   FT  26 OCT 94 / Southern Africa eyes prize of peace: As Mozambique and Angola edge warily toward a lasting peace, Michael Holman, Nicholas Shaxton and Peter Stanley assess the likely impact on the region      By MICHAEL HOLMAN, NICHOLAS SHAXTON and PETER STANLEY   If the 60m people of southern Africa were capable of collectively crossing their fingers, and uttering a silent prayer, they would be doing so this week. The outcome of Mozambique's elections and Angola's peace talks will determine whether the region can, for the first time in three decades, secure peace. Here, in the two countries where the old southern Africa was born some 400 years ago, the final stages in the shaping of the new southern Africa are taking place. It was on the coasts of Angola and Mozambique that the Portuguese seafarers Vasco da Gama and Bartolomeu Dias laid claim to an African empire which was to last until 1974. That year the foundations of white rule began to crack, for the coup in Lisbon in 1974 not only paved the way to independence for Portugal's African colonies, it marked the beginning of the end for minority regimes in Rhodesia and South Africa. The days ahead now see the final phase of that process, which has been hastened by the collapse of communism and the end of superpower rivalries. In Mozambique, 6.5m voters go to the polls tomorrow and Friday in the country's first multi-party elections. If they proceed without mishap, the country can begin to develop an economy shattered by civil conflict and external aggression. In Angola, talks aimed at bringing an end to the civil war may be within reach of success, according to Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, United Nations secretary-general. Should Mr Jonas Savimbi, the Unita leader who forced the collapse of the 1991 settlement when he refused to accept his defeat by President Eduardo dos Santos in the election the following year, agree to the terms negotiated over the past nine months in the Zambian capital Lusaka, the last piece of the regional settlement falls into place. And if both Mozambique and Angola manage to secure a lasting peace in the critical days ahead, it would mark a watershed for the region, led today by newly democratic South Africa. Free of racial division and civil war, without external aggressors, and accepting the principles of democracy and civil rights, and with market driven economic planning, southern Africa will have a common cause: to develop the potential of lands rich in oil and natural gas, minerals, marine resources and agricultural produce, with the bonus of thousands of miles of fine beaches encompassing Af-rica's finest wildlife res-erves. But although the foundations of the new region are in place, much can yet go wrong before the edifice is finally complete. In Mozambique Mr Afonso Dhlakama, leader of the erstwhile rebel Renamo party and the main challenger to President Joaquim Chissano's ruling Frelimo party, seems to be hinting that he, like Mr Savimbi, might not accept defeat at the polls. Meanwhile peace may yet prove elusive in Angola, notwithstanding the optimism of Mr Boutros Ghali, who in his report to the Security Council said that 'the peace talks are now in their final phase'. The collapse of Angola's transition to democracy is fresh in the minds of the Mozambique electorate. Mr Chissano, whose party has ruled Mozambique since independence, is widely expected to win, but made clear that Mr Dhlakama would be part of a coalition government only on his terms, unconditionally accepting Frelimo policies. The differences between the two parties are not ideological, however, but stem from regional, ethnic and personal rivalries. 'First we are asking whether Mr Dhlakama will accept my programme with no preconditions,' said the president. 'I think it is necessary to have opposition, but in parliament, not in the administration. . . Renamo is not an opposition in ideological terms.' Some observers suspect that Mr Dhlakama is preparing the way for a return to the bush war. He has repeated recent warnings that Renamo would not tolerate electoral fraud in the presidential and parliamentary polls. Unlike Angola, however, the integration of rival armies is more advanced and the UN monitoring force is 7,000 strong - nearly 10 times the Angola contingent - and is backed by 2,400 international observers. Both sides, however, are thought to have substantial arms caches and to have kept back soldiers in reserve. Whichever party wins the elections, only a coalition government can effectively tackle the legacy of 400 years of colonialism and 30 years of war. Meanwhile in Angola the UN secretary-general's optimism is not shared by the people in Luanda. 'If the two sides show the necessary political will, the outstanding issues can be resolved within a short time', Mr Boutros Ghali said recently, and urged the Angolan government and Unita to conclude the peace talks by October 31. Should a final deal be struck, it would involve a revival of the 1991 accords. But the collapse of the transition in late 1992 inspired new hatreds. The Unita fighters used hidden weapons stockpiles rapidly to capture much of Angola's territory, while in the main towns and cities MPLA vigilante groups hunted down and killed Unita supporters. The renewed distrust will make disarmament of both sides, envisaged under the new peace plan, a difficult exercise. The two sides do agree that Angola needs a UN force at least 6,000 strong to oversee a ceasefire. Both government and Unita officials are doubtful, however, about the world's willingness to pay for an exercise on this scale and provide the manpower required. Without a settlement, the conflict seems set to drag on as neither side is likely to win the war. Unita is able to make much of the countryside ungovernable, but is unable to capture MPLA urban strongholds. Neither side seems short of funds. For the government, proceeds come from more than 500,000 barrels of oil that flow daily from mainly offshore oilfields. For Unita, an estimated Dollars 250m (Pounds 158.2m) worth of diamonds have been leaked out from its territory, which includes the main diamond producing areas. Generals and politicians on both sides openly recognise that the war is unwinnable. And the size of the prize at stake is so great that they know they will not readily be forgiven if they squander the opportunity for peace. Angola is in the fortunate position of being able to fund its recover by using the oil and diamond wealth that currently funds the war, and take part in the wider reconstruction of the region. For the first time southern Africa is attracting the attention of emerging market funds, thanks both to political change in South Africa and economic reforms across the continent. Although the bulk of the Dollars 2bn-Dollars 3bn the market might attract will go to South Africa, nearly a dozen stock markets are now competing for business - in Botswana, Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Kenya, Mauritius, Namibia, Nigeria, Swaziland, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Traditional obstacles to investment  -ranging from artificially fixed exchange rates and exchange controls to government hostility - are being eased or removed altogether. For the first time in 400 years, the region will be free of systems of racially based hegemony, free of conflict, free of the ideological differences that marked the post independence era of Africa, and able to harness the power of South Africa. If Mozambique and Angola succeed in their transition to lasting democracy, the people of southern Africa may be able to look back on the days ahead as the start of a new and more prosperous era.  --------------------------------------------------------       THE EVENTS THAT SHAPED A NEW SOUTHERN AFRICA  -------------------------------------------------------- 1974  Portugal's dictatorship ousted.  -------------------------------------------------------- 1975  Portugal cedes independence to colonies, including       Angola and Mozambique, where guerrilla wars began       in early 1960s.

Civil war continuedm exacerbated by South African invasions and the arrival of Cuban troops.  A ceasefire resulted in elections in 1992, with the ruling MPLA defeating the opposing Unita movement.

Several diplomats in the region said right-wing opponents of South African  President Frederik W. de Klerk's efforts to end his country's racial separation  policy of apartheid are also backing the Renamo guerrillas fighting the  Mozambique government.    ""The people trying to stop the internal revolution in South Africa are the same  people destabilizing Mozambique,"" the European diplomat said. ""If you believe  the revolution in South Africa is irreversible, you must believe peace will  come back to Mozambique. War doesn't make sense anymore.""    The head of the U.N. development program in Mozambique, Peter Simkin, warned  that the country faces mass famine. Diplomats estimate two-thirds of the  population already live in absolute poverty and malnutrition is endemic.    More than 5 million people have been driven from their homes, while the United  Nations estimated there were 900,000 war-related deaths in eight years  beginning with 1980.    ""Mozambique is living on a knife edge that could easily become a disaster area  of major proportions . . . it could translate into famine later this year or  early next year and we have no resources to fall back on,"" Simkin said in an  interview. ""We are not in a position to prevent disaster or to mount a massive  relief campaign.""    Diplomats said pledges of aid dropped sharply this year due in part to the  Persian Gulf crisis, reconstruction demands for Eastern Europe and ""donor  weariness.""    Government and church leaders in Mozambique were optimistic in early September  that a peace agreement with Renamo was possible after two rounds of talks in  Rome. President Joaquim Chissano, who has promised the country's first-ever  multi-party presidential and parliamentary elections for next year, even talked  about peace by Christmas.    But Renamo's refusal to attend a third round of talks in September has deadened  optimism, with Chissano throwing the blame squarely on the rebels.    Diplomats note the ruling Frelimo Party in Maputo has basically preempted all  Renamo demands by ditching its socialist ideology and agreeing to a market  economy, political pluralism and a free press.    ""You know if you have an open multi-party system, Renamo has no hope of gaining  power,"" one diplomat said.    The shadowy rebel movement demanded withdrawal of Zimbabwe troops from  Mozambique and an end to attacks on Renamo base areas as a prerequisite for  further talks.    Diplomats estimate Zimbabwe has 6,000 troops in Mozambique, primarily to  protect the so-called Beira corridor rail link from Zimbabwe to the Indian  Ocean port of Beira.    "" . . . The achievement of peace would mean a quick withdrawal of all Zimbabwe  troops,"" President Chissano told journalists at the United Nations in New York  recently. ""All those interested in seeing the country free of foreign troops  should cooperate so that we can achieve peace as soon as possible -- tomorrow  if possible.""    Renamo, the Mozambique Resistance Movement, originally was set up by the white  minority government of Ian Smith in what was then Rhodesia as a destabilizing  force after Mozambique achieved independence from Portugal in June, 1975.    Diplomats in southern Africa said the Rhodesians recruited Renamo guerrillas  from among black members of Portugal's former colonial forces. They were used  primarily against black nationalists operating out of Mozambique against  Rhodesia.    When Rhodesia became Zimbabwe with independence in 1980, the former white  security forces handed Renamo over to South Africa, which continued to use it  against Maputo.    Pretoria and Maputo signed the Nkomati Accord of nonaggression and  good-neighborliness in 1984 and the South African government subsequently cut  all official links with Renamo.    Chissano himself has said he trusted Pretoria's good faith.    Diplomats also believe South Africa severed ties with Renamo, cutting it off  from weapons and communications supplies.    But they said it appears right-wing groups in South Africa, including  Portuguese emigres hoping to recover property they left behind in Mozambique,  continued to support the rebels.

0,FT941-16376 ,"FT941-16376 _AN-EAKC0ABJFT 940111   FT  11 JAN 94 / Salinas sacks interior minister      By DAMIAN FRASER      MEXICO CITY   President Carlos Salinas fired Mexico's hardline interior minister yesterday and put the foreign minister in charge of a commission to bring peace to the troubled southern state of Chiapas. The cabinet changes were the most dramatic response yet to last week's uprising in Chiapas, in which more than 100 people have died. While the army has gained virtual control of the area, the conflict continues in the hills and jungle around the former rebel strongholds. Mr Salinas replaced Mr Patrocinio Gonzalez Blanco Garrido, the outgoing minister of the interior, with the reputable attorney-general, Mr Jorge Carpizo. The foreign minister, Mr Manuel Camacho, resigned to take over a non-governmental commission to bring peace to the area. Mr Gonzalez, until last year governor of the state of Chiapas, has been widely attacked for failing to anticipate the uprising in Chiapas, and for his oppression of indigenous groups while running the state government. Mr Carpizo is a respected former head of the government human rights commission and national university. The cabinet change came as Mexico's stock market experienced one of its worse days in recent history. The market closed down 6.3 per cent in heavy volume, its biggest one-day fall in more than four years. 'The market is worried that the conflict in Chiapas may drag on and that it may not be confined to Chiapas,' said Mr Timothy Heyman, head of Baring Securities in Mexico City. 'The beginning of a dialogue would be construed as a very positive signal.' President Salinas said Mr Carpizo's mission would be to bring peace and respect for the law to Chiapas, and ensure that the presidential elections this August would be conducted according to the constitution and new electoral law. A government spokesman added that the removal of Mr Gonzalez sent a message of conciliation to rebel groups. 'At the same time that the stranglehold is being applied in the area of combat, the government is open to all avenues of dialogue,' he said. The government previously laid down conditions for talks with the rebels that amounted to unconditional surrender. It is still not clear if the government is willing to offer new conditions for negotiations. The Defence Ministry said late on Sunday that the military base outside San Cristobal de las Casas had come under renewed attack, and that on Friday rebels had launched another offensive against the city of Ococingo. Notimex, the state-owned news agency, reported two explosions next to a communications tower in Chiapas on Sunday night and three that damaged an electricity tower in the state of Mexico. The explosions followed four bombs in Mexico City over the weekend. Mr Samuel Ruiz, the bishop of San Cristobal, accepted a rebel request to mediate in talks aimed at ending the uprising. Mr Rigobertu Menchu, the Guatemalan Nobel prize winner for peace, rejected their offer.   Countries:-  MXZ  Mexico.   Industries:-  P9199 General Government, NEC.   Types:-  PEOP  People.

In  talks with a delegation of the Russian parliament's lower house  [State Duma], Kontic said that Russia's efforts have prevented  the escalation of the fighting in Bosnia and underscored that  the further continuation of the international sanctions against  Yugoslavia practically prolongs the crisis in the former  Yugoslav territory.    The head of the Russian parliamentary delegation, Nikolay  Bezbirodov, said that the aim of the visit is to see for  themselves the situation in Yugoslavia and the developments in  Bosnia, and thus enable the lower house of the Russian  parliament to make objective and principled decisions.  Bezbirodov, who is deputy chairman of the parliamentary Defence  Committee, said that he lower house is aware that the sanctions  should be lifted and that they do not contribute to the  resolution of the crisis in ex-Yugoslav territory. He said that  the lower house is opposed to the use of military power in the  settlement of the Bosnian crisis and that all conflicts should  be resolved through negotiations, in a peaceful way.    The Russian delegation also met with the Speaker of the  Yugoslav Parliament's lower house, Radoman Bozovic, who said  that peace in Bosnia should be established immediately along the  separation lines and then that all international institutions  should be engaged to take part in political talks on all open  issues. He said that the peace process requires the objective  and equal treatment of the Serb people, on the same footing as  all the other warring sides. Pointing out that it is senseless  to further maintain the sanctions against Yugoslavia, the  Russian delegation said that a legal project on their lifting  had been drafted in the lower house, but that the procedure had  been halted for the present due to the deterioration of the  situation in Gorazde.

The president said at a news conference he held with  President Demirel this afternoon that the talks also dealt with  various topical issues in the Arab region, in addition to  international issues.    Commenting on developments in Yemen, President Mubarak  affirmed that there is absolutely no plan to send Arab troops to  Yemen, noting that he warned the Yemeni president and his vice  president before the fighting erupted. He said that the  Egyptian Foreign Ministry had previously addressed appeals to  the Yemeni parties in this connection.    President Mubarak remarked that it is the entire Yemeni  people who will suffer from that fighting.    Touching on Egyptian-Turkish bilateral issues, Mubarak noted  that the joint higher committee involving the two countries will  meet in June or July to discuss scopes of cooperation in detail.    Turkish President Suleyman Demirel said that his visit to  Egypt reaffirms the deep ties that have linked the two  countries. He said that Egypt and Turkey are major regional  states and that they both seek to bring about peace and  stability in the region to serve the people's interests.    Demirel added that he congratulated President Mubarak on the  signing of the Palestinian-Israeli Agreement on autonomy in Gaza  and Jericho in Cairo last Wednesday. He remarked that the  Egyptian policy in this context is consistently successful.    Touching on the economic embargo on Iraq and its impact on  Turkey, and whether he had discussed this issue with President  Mubarak, Demirel said: The issue was raised during the talks.  He pointed out that the international community is not prepared  to do anything to lift that embargo at present.    President Mubarak opened the news conference with a speech  in which he welcomed the Turkish president to Egypt. He said:  We made it a habit to meet every once in a while to exchange  views on hot issues and those of common interest in the Middle  East, as well as other issues like Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Mubarak added: We focused in our talks on bilateral  relations and discussed many issues in this context. The  president noted that a businessmen's delegation will visit  Istanbul in June. He also said that they agreed to hold a  meeting of the joint Egyptian-Turkish higher committee in June  or July to be cochaired by the prime ministers of both countries  to discuss bilateral agreements. We consider these agreements  very important because we think of Turkey as a major and central  regional state and we want to maintain strong and good ties with  it, Mubarak said.    President Demirel then delivered a speech in which he  thanked  President Mubarak and said: It is my pleasure to visit Egypt as  a guest of my dear brother President Husni Mubarak. I feel I am  in my home in this great country because the close ties between  Egypt and Turkey are built on foundations of a common cultural  and historical heritage.    He said those bonds strengthen fraternal relations between  the peoples of Egypt and Turkey. He said every high-level visit  between the two countries prove the depth of bilateral  relations. He said the two countries, which he described as  crossroads for several continents, have common political  objectives.    President Demirel said Egypt and Turkey are trying to  achieve  economic development while sparing no effort to help bring about  peace and stability in their common region.    He added: During our talks today, our exchange of viewpoints  was fruitful. We reviewed all aspects of bilateral cooperation  and stressed during the talks that there is not any difference  in our views toward political issues.    Demirel went on: We agreed that the relations of economic  cooperation between Egypt and Turkey need further efforts and  support to match the strong political relations between us.    He stressed that stronger cooperation will reflect  positively  on the peoples of the whole region. He explained that Egypt and  Turkey are the biggest countries in the region, and they both  feel they are responsible for the region's peace and stability.    President Demirel said that he and President Mubarak  discussed several regional problems and reviewed the situation  in the Balkans and in the Caucasus. The former Soviet Union is  being restructured and we are interested in such matters because  they affect both Egypt and Turkey.    President Demirel said he was pleased with his meeting with  President Mubarak. He added: I congratulated President Mubarak  on the success of his efforts, which were rewarded by the  signing of the Palestinian-Israeli Agreement in Cairo. I also  told him that he should consider the signing of this agreement  his birthday present.    The Turkish president expressed hope that the 50-year-old  Middle East conflict will come to an end and that a new vista of  opportunity will open for Egyptian-Turkish cooperation. He said  that the two countries should walk ""hand in hand"" toward a new  horizon of peace and prosperity in the region.    The two leaders then fielded questions by journalists.    Answering a question on the events in Yemen, President  Mubarak said: ""I wish to make it clear that we warned the Yemeni  president of the implications of the Yemeni crisis, even before  the fighting started. I told the Yemenis that their troops are  deployed close to each other and that unless they separate them,  fighting may break out and will be hard to stop. They did not  listen.""    I sent several appeals to the Yemeni president and the  Egyptian Foreign Ministry did the same, Mubarak said. I told  Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih: ""It would be wise if you  separate the troops and try to calm down the situation. You  have to sit together and work out your differences. Otherwise,  the entire Yemeni people will suffer.""    President Mubarak added: ""Fighting then erupted in Yemen.  They are exchanging shells and accusations. They bombarded  each other's airports.""    The Arab League is today meeting at the level of  representatives, Mubarak said. He added: I do not think that  there are any plans to send Arab forces to Yemen. Newspaper  reports to this effect do not match reality. I think that all  the Arab League can do is appeal for an end to the fighting and  for a peaceful solution that would enable the Yemenis to go on  with their lives. The current fighting is a loss for all  Yemenis, Mubarak stated.    Answering a question on Egyptian-Turkish cooperation,  Mubarak  said: We have discussed several areas of cooperation, including  tourism, but I do not wish to go into detail. The Higher  Egyptian-Turkish Committee, which is cochaired by the two prime  ministers, will discuss various aspects of cooperation, such as  joint projects and banking agreements. Mubarak pointed out that  his talks with Demirel touched on trade, friendship agreements,  and the formation of a committee on tourism.    A journalist asked Mubarak if there had been progress  concerning the proposal Mubarak made during his visit to Turkey  in February concerning Egyptian-Turkish-Saudi cooperation.  Mubarak answered by saying: Let us begin with Egyptian-Turkish  cooperation. If another country wishes to join us, it is up to  that country to make its wishes known.    Asked whether Turkey can play a role in the Middle East  peace process, President Mubarak said: I would not specify  precisely this role. However, I can frankly say that Turkey is  a strong state in the region and so is Egypt. Turkey is a very  important state in the Middle East.    Asked whether he had discussed with the Turkish president  regional cooperation in fighting terrorism, President Mubarak  said: We discussed this topic. The two countries' foreign  ministers will discuss the kind of cooperation that can exist  between the two countries in this domain, in addition to  discussing the possibility of other countries joining this  cooperation. We will do this quietly in the beginning to see  what this cooperation will produce.    Asked whether he discussed with President Mubarak the  economic embargo imposed on Iraq and its effect on Turkey,  President Demirel said: We discussed this topic but did not go  into detail. As you know, the international community and the  alliance (formed during the Gulf War) are very sensitive about  the Gulf war and Iraq's stand. In my personal opinion, it is  [not further identified] against these sanctions. However, the  international community is not prepared to do anything in this  respect. Demirel said: The sanctions have harmed the Iraqi  people, not just the Iraqi president.    Asked about his concept of cooperation between Egypt and  Turkey to confront terrorism in the region, Demirel said:  Cooperation between Egypt and Turkey is excellent and there are  no problems. What we discussed today and what we will discuss in  the future will be beneficial for the Egyptian and Turkish  peoples.    Commenting on Demirel's remarks, President Mubarak said: We  are anxious to have good cooperation between Egypt and Turkey in  all domains.     "

De Leon, who attended the swearing-in ceremony of the new  Honduran president, regretted that the bombings, blackouts, and  some shootings, which took place in the capital last night, are  creating tension in his country two days before the referendum.  In Sunday's referendum, the people will decide whether to  approve a series of constitutional reforms, the most important  of which will allow new officials to be appointed to the  Congress and to the Supreme Court this year.    De Leon said he and Honduran President Carlos Roberto Reina  share the goals of fighting corruption, drug trafficking, and  poverty, as well as the search for peace and economic growth  with social justice for everyone. The Guatemalan president  noted that guerrillas have been active in his country over the  past 30 years. He said his government will resume talks with  the rebels in mid-February in a search for peace in the only  Central American country where an armed conflict persists.    De Leon Carpio said he hopes a peace agreement will be  signed  this year because a commitment has been made to the United  Nations to achieve this goal. He also said that if the parties  fail to reach an agreement, they would be showing a lack of  commitment.     "
