The announcement by Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, was made in a written parliamentary answer at the same time as Thursday's coal white paper - but not mentioned by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, in his Commons' statement. Colleagues of Sir Patrick yesterday denied that the timing of the move was deliberate. Although Mr Roy Beggs, the Ulster Unionist Party's energy spokesman, said: 'I'm very pleased that the secretary of state has responded as positively as he has.' The party's nine MPs have agreed to meet on Monday to decide how to vote that night. In October they helped save the government from defeat over the pit closures by abstaining in a Commons vote. Although their votes are now less crucial, ministers have listened carefully to Northern Ireland MPs' demands over the last five months and Mr Beggs has met Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister. Ulster Unionists have also welcomed the European Commission's decision earlier this month to give about Pounds 60m towards the cost of the planned electricity interconnector between Northern Ireland and Scotland. Mr Beggs said his party had been concerned about electricity costs which, he said, were up to 25 per cent higher for large industrial users than on the mainland.

0,FT943-3201 ,"FT943-3201 _AN-EIOC7ADCFT 940915   FT  15 SEP 94 / Survey of Northern Ireland (7): The textile base remains strong - Ulster companies are leading suppliers to British retail chains      By JOHN MCMANUS   Pyjamas and tights may not have the glamour of haute couture, but the manufacture of these staple items of clothing for British retailers, such as Marks  Spencer, keep more than 16,000 people in work in Northern Ireland. Garment manufacturing is now the most important sector of Northern Ireland's textile industry, itself the most significant manufacturing sector in employment terms, with annual sales exceeding Pounds lbn. Out of around 100,000 manufacturing jobs in Northern Ireland, around 26,000 are in the textiles industry, of which garment manufacture accounts for around 16,000. An additional 10,000 people are employed indirectly by the textile industry. The strength of Northern Ireland's garment industry is due to a combination of factors: the historically strong textile industry base; the growth of the British chain stores; and the high level of government support available since the start of the troubles 25 years ago. The skilled workforce and infrastructure developed by the linen industry allowed Northern Ireland-based garment manufactures to start supplying British retail chains, and to grow with them as they came to dominate the clothing market in Britain. 'Chain stores account for 60 per cent of clothing sales in Britain and provide the volume demand required by manufacturers to achieve economies of scale,' explains Mr Bruce Robinson, the deputy chief executive of Northern Ireland's development agency, the Industrial Development Board(IDB). The generous level of capital grants available in Northern Ireland over the last two decades - up to 40 per cent more than in the UK - has meant that local companies have been able to equip themselves with the expensive machinery needed to supply products of the quality required by chain stores. Northern Ireland's garment manufacturers would prefer to explain their success in terms of increased competitiveness. 'Our competitive edge is better design, a very close relationship with the customer, and a quick response time,' explains Mr Sean O'Dwyer, the managing director of Desmonds, a supplier to Marks and Spencer, which employs 2,700 people, making nightwear and other clothing. Northern Ireland-based suppliers, such as Desmonds, offer British retailers the facility to drop unsuccessful lines in mid-season and increase production of successful ones, so that they avoid being left with surplus stock at the end of the season. Although Far Eastern manufacturers might be more competitive on a cost basis, they are at a severe disadvantage when it comes to response time. The only way in which they can match Northern Ireland based suppliers is to air-freight their products, which is prohibitively expensive. It is an advantage which Desmonds has successfully exploited. Expansion plans The family-owned firm started supplying Marks and Spencer 40 years ago, and now sells the chain store about Pounds 100m worth of clothing a year - 'we're pretty confident that we can increase output. By 1998 we plan to have increased volume by 40 per cent,' comments Mr O'Dywer. Desmonds plans to invest about Pounds 5m under the expansion plan creating a further 600 jobs. The outlook for the garment sector is better now than it was ten years ago, believes Mr Terry McCartney, the chief executive of Charnos, which has extensive textiles interest in Northern Ireland through its Adria subsidiary. 'We have seen the industry being weakened by cheap imports, but I think that is changing and we are winning back market share through the quality of our service and design,' he explains. Adria, which produces branded and own-brand hosiery and lingerie for UK retailers has increased employment by 250 this year, opening a Pounds 5.4m lingerie factory in Derry. The company plans to open a new hosiery knitting factory in Strabane this year and hopes to employ over 1,500 people in Northern Ireland by the end of 1996. The garment industry's strength is not reflected in other parts of the industry, however - particularly carpet-making. Last month, textile group Richards announced it was closing its carpet-making subsidiary in Bangor, Spence Bryson, with the loss of 175 jobs. The closure was blamed on fierce competition in the UK carpet market. 'The performance of the carpet industry is linked to activity at retail level and the number of new housing starts,' according to Mr Desmond Morgan of the Northern Ireland Textile Association - 'these have been very slow to pick up and matters have not been helped by the entry into the UK market of the US carpet giant, Shaw International.' Textile yarns and fabric are a very important sector of the industry in Northern Ireland and are set to become more so with the decision of Taiwanese group, Hualon, to set up near Belfast. Although questions have been raised about the appropriateness of the decision to give Pounds 61m in grants to Hualon, the 1,800 jobs which the project will create in Belfast are very welcome. The fully integrated textile plant will dye, finish, weave and spin nylon, cotton and polyester-cotton fabrics. Other textile companies such as cotton spinners and weavers, Fruit of the Loom and Courtaulds Textiles, form the second largest sector in the textile industry in employment terms, accounting for the bulk of non-garment employment. The linen industry remains a significant employer, although it underwent rationalisation in the mid-1960s and 1970s. Northern Irish linen manufacturers, who produce about 20 per cent of Europe's linen, have been forced to move away from their traditional market, which was household fabrics. However, the return to fashion of natural fabrics, has given linen spinners a new lease of life in export markets.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

As Unionists prepared to join today the process of round-table talks taking place in Belfast, Mr Richard Needham, the province's economy minister, stuck by the Northern Ireland's Office plans to split the electricity utility in preparation for privatisation. His intransigence came despite pleas for a re-think in order to foster the co-operation ministers hope will see a new devolved government in the province and a replacement Anglo-Irish agreement. As if to tempt participants in the round-table talks, Mr Needham said that, if a new administration for the province was set up this summer, locally elected politicians would be able to reverse his decision. Mr Kevin McNamara, Labour's Northern Ireland spokesman, last night called for privatisation plans to be shelved while round-table talks continued. Before 'direct rule' in 1972, energy policy had been in the control of the Northern Ireland administration, he said. Mr Peter Brooke, Northern Ireland secretary, today meets Mr James Molyneaux and the Rev Ian Paisley, leaders of the main Unionist parties, for what could be the last of his bilateral meetings before full round-table discussions start - probably next Tuesday. Mr Molyneaux and Mr Paisley have joined forces with Mr John Hume, leader of the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour Party, to ask for a meeting with Mr John Major to discuss Northern Ireland electricity. At question time yesterday, Mr Hume drew parallels between the co-operation over the electricity industry and hopes for political progress. He urged Mr Needham to 'reconsider your position'.

In a meeting with Mr Nicholas Winterton, Tory MP and chairman of the Manufacturing and Construction Industries Alliance, and other textile industry chiefs, Sir Patrick said that he would 'give full consideration' to claims that the Hualon project could lead to substantial losses in the textile industry on the mainland. He would not, however, commit the government to reviewing its decision to give Pounds 61m in aid to the Taiwanese company to build its plant. Sir Patrick also pointed out that the potential for job displacement had already been taken into account by ministers, and that state support for Hualon had been ap-proved by the European Commission. Textile manufacturers say that the Hualon project would lead to job losses because of existing overproduction of textiles in Europe. Although Hualon could employ more than 1,300 people, the project has been described as a 'Trojan horse' which could give the south-east Asian textile industry a foothold in Europe. Mr Winterton emphasised at yesterday's meeting that existing textile companies in Northern Ireland risked losing jobs if the project went ahead. He also claimed that one Northern Ireland company feared it could be 'deskilled' as a result of Hualon taking its trained operatives. The Northern Ireland Office restated yesterday that there was scope for Hualon to sell products to mainland Europe and the US, and to substitute products which are now imported to Britain from south-east Asia.

The move is in spite of a government promise last week of at least Pounds 10m to curb rises. The increases come at a time when electricity companies in England and Wales are freezing or reducing prices. Domestic customers of Northern Ireland Electricity will have to pay 2.3 per cent more or 6 per cent if they use off-peak Economy Seven. Mr Nigel Smith, local director of the Confederation of British Industry, said it was very worrying. Northern Ireland Electricity, which is to be privatised in the summer, said electricity in the province was on a different system to that in England and Wales. More than 80 per cent of electricity was generated from oil in Northern Ireland and the benefits of cheaper coal, which English and Welsh consumers were enjoying, were less.

But it is still resisting any help for insurers on the UK mainland. Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, announced yesterday that he had agreed an 'insurance policy excess'. The Treasury will provide a back-up if the sums paid out in compensation in Northern Ireland exceed the amount allocated in his department's budget. The deal follows the unprecedented freezing of Northern Ireland spending programmes in the last financial year because of unexpected extra costs of the compensation scheme. However, the Treasury said no parallels should be made with the situation on the mainland where no similar scheme operates - in spite of threats by insurance companies to withdraw cover for terrorist attacks on commercial property from next year. Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, is talking with insurance companies about possible solutions. The Treasury said the Northern Ireland agreement was to make clear where the burden of any extra payout would fall. It added: 'It is not a matter of generosity. It is a matter of good control of public expenditure.' In 1991-92, the Northern Ireland Office paid out Pounds 33m in compensation but the amounts vary considerably from year to year according to the extent of terrorist attacks. With the IRA now apparently targeting commercial property, this year's total could be substantially higher. The NIO does not reveal how much is set aside each year for the scheme.

0,FT943-3205 ,"FT943-3205 _AN-EIOC7AC8FT 940915   FT  15 SEP 94 / Survey of Northern Ireland (2): A puzzle for the economists  -Prolonged peace could bring a 'peace dividend' - or, some warn, a 'peace deficit' / The Northern Irish economy is recovering faster than the British economy as a whole      By JOHN MCMANUS   It is probably not surprising that peace should be as divisive amongst Northern Ireland's economists as 25 years of violence has been amongst the population at large. The 'issue' in Northern Irish economic circles at the moment is the impact on the economy of a prolonged, hopefully indefinite, period of peace. It is best summed up by the question: 'Is there going to be a peace dividend or a peace deficit?' There are some facts about the situation accepted by both sides in the debate, including the fact that the Northern Irish economy has been buffered from the worst of the recent recession by a Pounds 3bn to Pounds 4bn a year subsidy from the British Exchequer. It is also accepted that the Northern Irish economy is recovering faster than the British economy as a whole. This is particularly obvious in key measures such as Northern Irish production output and manufacturing industries output, which, on an indexed basis, have been ahead of Britain since mid-1990. Although unemployment in Northern Ireland remains the highest in Britain, at just under 13 per cent, employment has remained stable since 1990, despite a significant decline in Britain. In fact, looking back, it is debatable whether Northern Ireland had a recession at all. If you take a decline in GDP over two successive quarters as a definition of a recession, then it definitely did not have one. However, what economists do not agree on is that peace will benefit the economy and support the recovery. Dr Graham Gudgin of the Northern Ireland Economic Research Centre is one of the doubters - 'security-related expenditure accounts for about one third of the Pounds 4bn annual subvention . . . there is a huge question mark as to whether the north would be allowed to keep that money if peace broke out.' The possible benefits to the Northern Irish economy of increased tourism and other aspects of peace, would not outweigh the effect of losing the subsidy, he believes. Up to 20,000 well-paid jobs in the security forces and related areas could be lost, predicts Dr Gudgin. The type of jobs that are supposed to replace them, particularly in areas such as tourism, will be relatively low-paid, he points out. The government, not surprisingly, is much more positive and the Minister of State at Northern Ireland's Department of Economic Development, Mr Tim Smith, has cited unpublished research showing that 'over a number of years' the net effect of peace will beneficial in job terms. A similar stance has been taken by the Confederation of British Industry in Northern Ireland, which estimates that job growth through inward investment will quadruple from about 500 per year to 2,000 over a two-to-three year period, while perhaps another 70,000 jobs will be created in the tourism industry. One economist who is very positive about the impact of peace is Mr Douglas Hamilton, who works with the Government policy advisory group, the Northern Ireland Economic Council. Mr Hamilton believes there would be a tremendous boost to industry from operating in an environment not tempered by a political climate of violence and conflict. 'The troubles did not really lead to companies pulling out, but to a situation where they do not operate under normal conditions,' he claims. Mr Hamilton also believes that there would be pressure on the British government to let the Northern Irish economy down gently, by phasing-out the payment gradually and creating a reconstruction or redevelopment fund. Although the British government has not committed itself to such a fund, there have already been suggestions of increased aid from the United States and the European Union. The US is considering donating up to Dollars 150m over two to three years through the International Fund for Ireland. The fund was established by the British and Irish governments in 1986 and raises money in North America and Europe for projects that encourage reconciliation and economic regeneration. The president of the European Commission, Mr Jacques Delors, has said the European Union may increase the size of the donation it makes to the International Fund. There will be fundamental changes in the Northern Irish economy, which has many structural weaknesses, if peace becomes permanent, believes Mr Hamilton. Paradoxically, it was the structural weakness that led to the admirable performance of the Northern Irish economy during the recent recession, according to Mr Hamilton. The under-developed nature of Northern Ireland's financial services industry and the dynamics of its property market, with no appreciable shortage of private sector housing, meant that the boom in personal credit that led to the British recession, bypassed Northern Ireland. The absence of speculative pressure on house prices meant that people in Northern Ireland had nothing like the level of personal debt that people in the South of England had when high interest rates hit at the end of the 1980s. The distorted nature of Northern Ireland's employment patterns, with the government employing roughly 200,000 out of a total workforce of about 800,000, had a strong buffering effect also, explains Mr Hamilton. In addition, the exceptionally high level of grants that have been available in Northern Ireland since the start of the troubles - up to 40 per cent of capital expenditure - meant that Northern Irish companies went into recessions very well capitalised and with less debt than most British competitors. The strong performance of Northern Ireland's manufacturing industry is not merely accidental, points out Mr Gudgin. As a sector, it is less dependent on the British market than most companies in the UK. Sales to Britain only account for one third of output, compared to two thirds for most British industry. In addition, wage levels in Northern Ireland have fallen by about 10 per cent below British levels in the last ten years, due mostly to unemployment and the end of collective wage bargaining, says Dr Gudgin. One area in which Dr Gudgin and Mr Hamilton do concur is in their caution when it comes to predictions for the Northern Irish economy. In the absence of any appreciable peace dividend, both economists find it hard to accept that the North will out-perform Britain in the long term. 'Northern Ireland follows the British cycle,' explains Dr Gudgin, but he adds: 'If wage advantage and other advantages can be maintained, there is evidence that there will be something of a long-term improvement in the competitive position.'

0,FT923-1766 ,"FT923-1766 _AN-CIUDDAFJFT 920921   FT  21 SEP 92 / Survey of Northern Ireland (10): Hackles rise over sell-offs  -Unions say privatisations will hit the consumer in the pocket      By JIM FLANAGAN   PRIVATISATION reached Northern Ireland later than it did the rest of Britain. The process of transferring government-owned companies and public utilities to the private sector only got going just over three years ago. The management-employee buy-out of Harland and Wolff, the Belfast shipbuilder and the sale of aircraft and missiles manufacturer Short Brothers to Bombardier, Canadian transportation giant, signalled the start of privatisation in earnest. In spite of fierce trade union opposition, the sales were completed and saved the UK government from paying substantial annual subsidies to keep the businesses afloat. While privatised companies have not had it easy since then, Harland has a reasonably healthy order book and Shorts, the region's largest private company, was profitable enough two years ago to enable a dividend to be paid on shares for the first time in years. Successful transfers to the private sector encouraged the government to press on with its timetable. The first part of the privatisation of the electricity industry was completed with the sale of the province's four power stations to British Gas, NIGEN (an American/Belgian consortium) and a management-employee buy-out team. However, completing the flotation will not be so easy. Last week Mr Robert Atkins, the province's economy minister, unexpectedly announced that the flotation of the transmission, distribution and supply business of Northern Ireland Electricity (NIE) - planned for November - would be postponed. Mr Atkins said a number of outstanding matters needed to be resolved, the most important of which related to the funding of a proposed interconnector to Scotland. NIE and ScottishPower reached agreement on the Pounds 200m interconnector project earlier this year, and the government is believed to be seeking about Pounds 70m from the European Commission towards the cost of construction. Unions argue that, as well as leading to large scale redundancies, the sale will hit consumers in the pocket. The Federation of Unions Supplying Electricity believes the provision of an efficient service will be secondary to the requirement to keep shareholders happy by making profits. The government dismisses such fears and says legisation will be introduced to protect consumers. While the power industry sell-off is almost complete, another project in its early stages is already causing concern. The privatisation of water and sewerage services in Northern Ireland has set alarm bells ringing, although it is not taking place for another three years. Opponents point to experience elsewhere in the UK where bills have been rising. Two months ago, Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland Secretary, revealed that the government was dispensing with a plan to transfer the Department of the Environment's water and sewerage functions to a government-owned company before privatisation. The new proposal will take the services directly into the private sector in 1995/96, earlier than would otherwise have been the case. A customer billing system for water and sewerage will have to be introduced. Since domestic water charges are currently included in rates charges in Northern Ireland, the changes mean the calculation of the regional rate will have to be adjusted. The Northern Ireland Public Service Alliance (NIPSA) which represents 1,200 employees in the water industry, is angry at the sell-off proposals. Mr Sid McDowell, NIPSA deputy general secretary, said: 'Experience in England clearly shows that farming, industry and other commercial interests will face substantial increases in water charges. Northern Ireland will suffer those charges over a much shorter timescale than in England.' One of the big concerns is just who will pay the Pounds 500m being spent in the province over the next eight years to bring Ulster's water and sewerage facilities up to EC standards. Mr McDowell has no doubts about where the money will come from: 'Years of failing to invest in the water industry means that the vast amounts of money needed to make good that negligence will now be found by privatising and shifting the burden from the taxpayer to the consumer.' The General Consumer Council for Northern Ireland has called for a system of strict, independent regulation. Several other privatisations are in the pipeline. Northern Ireland Airports, which runs Belfast International Airport, is to be transferred to the private sector and a study has been commissioned on introducing a private element into the management and operation of Northern Ireland Railways - either in its entirety or on certain routes. Legislation on compulsory competition tendering is also to be introduced affecting all 26 of Northern Ireland local authorities. Councils will have to put out to tender their main services, such as refuse collecting and street cleaning. Again the unions say the cost will be a poorer service and job losses as companies vie for the work by under-cutting each other. In spite of the oppositon, however, there seems little chance of turning back the tide of privatisation. As one senior civil servant put it: 'The philosophy is enshrined in government policy. The sales will continue and the question is no longer whether to move to the private sector but how.'  The Financial Times   London Page 15  "

0,FT942-5686 ,"FT942-5686 _AN-EFCDVACMFT 940603   FT  03 JUN 94 / 'A respectable and respected public corporation': Statement by Tim Smith, economy minister for Northern Ireland, about the controversial Pounds 160m Hualon project      By TIM SMITH   The Hualon project to be located outside Belfast in Northern Ireland is a fully integrated textile plant involving dyeing, finishing, weaving and spinning of polycotton, cotton and nylon polyester fabrics. The plant will be established in four distinct phases over a period of eight years, and will involve total investment of almost Pounds 160m. Because of its size, and the need to obtain European Commission approval for state aid, it has created particular interest. I welcome the opportunity to clarify some issues. Independent scrutiny: Before submitting the proposal for consideration by the EC, the Industrial Development Board (IDB) subjected the Hualon business plan to a rigorous appraisal process. This involved a detailed review of the four main components of the business: marketing, production, technical, management and finance. The IDB also examined the project under the headings of viability, additionality and efficiency. In considering the nature, scope and size of the plan, it was considered that there were fundamental issues on which expert consultancy advice was needed. Specialist marketing and production/technical advice was provided by Kurt Salmon Associates, a leading independent internationally recognised textile consultancy firm. KSA addressed the following issues: the specific production and sales targets, the impact on European industry and the marketplace, the size and cost of the capital expenditure programme, the level of employment, and the costing structure. KSA's evaluation drew on key sources among potential customers, manufacturers and other industry interests throughout Europe. Its market assessment report included the following comments: 'Based on its wide knowledge and experience of the European textile and clothing industries, and supported by specific interviews to investigate market aspects related to the Hualon project, KSA believes that there is a realistic market opportunity for a Northern Ireland production facility and in the context of the changes occurring in the EC, Hualon's strategy is valid. 'The market for clothing will continue to grow. Despite predicted import penetration of 70 per cent by 2001, the manufacturing base in EC  - and more particularly in Eastern Europe and North Africa - will still be substantial and will benefit from a reliable, low-cost source of fabric such as that proposed by Hualon.' The consultants also confirmed that Hualon is a major successful world-class textile company with an impressive track record, and that its product range will compete predominately in the sector currently served by imports. Perhaps I could emphasise the point that the market for these products is not shrinking. Hualon will be competing from a European base in what is by any standards a substantial and growing market. In assessing this project we were aware of the previous interest of the Irish government in securing a project from the Hualon organisation and my officials have been in touch with their counterparts in Dublin. However, it should be made clear that the project originally announced for the Limerick area during October 1990 by the then minister Mr Des O'Malley was much smaller than the four-phase project destined for Northern Ireland. A statement dated March 25 1991 by Mr O'Malley, on his return from Taiwan, stated that this project had been 'put on hold'. Technology: The project is very much high-tech. Hualon propose to invest in the latest 'state of the art' weaving machinery. Waterjet and airjet looms from Tsudakoma will provide Hualon with the ability to produce high-quality, high-volume fabrics at the lower end of the market. Traditional European producers are generally moving towards weaving more complicated fabrics at the higher value end of the market which involves shorter runs and requires greater flexibility as provided by slower rapier-type looms. Hualon's success in Asia is built on its ability to operate at the leading edge of weaving technology by running its airjet and waterjet looms at greater efficiencies and speeds than its competitors can achieve. Indeed an article in the Technology section of the Financial Times of August 6 1993 referred to the 'greater speed and efficiency' of the waterjet looms. European Commission: In presenting our case to the European Community we emphasised the economic arguments in favour of the project. We also pointed out that the project would have a significant impact on a region which suffers from the highest unemployment figures in the United Kingdom and is recognised as an Objective 1 region in the European Union. Our representations to Europe were actively supported by the Unionist, DUP, and SDLP Northern Ireland members of the European Parliament, and the decision by the European Commission was welcomed by all shades of political opinion in Northern Ireland. The proposed location for the project, which has been known for some time, is a greenfield site accessible to all areas but particularly to North and West Belfast. The Oung family: As minister for the economy in Northern Ireland I have direct responsibility for the IDB, which is part of my Department of Economic Development. Both Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, and I have been closely involved with the Hualon case. We were fully aware of the allegations, which have been in the public domain for some time. I wish to emphasise that the IDB has been negotiating with a respectable and respected public corporation. As a matter of interest, we have not had any dealings with the persons charged. Safeguards: Northern Ireland does have the highest unemployment rate in the UK. However, this does not remove from government the obligation to consider most carefully each case which requires public funding. Invariably we build in appropriate safeguards. In the case of Hualon these safeguards will include continuing in-depth monitoring and the successful achievement of objectives in each of the four phases will be necessary before approval is given to grant-aid the next phase. There is absolutely no question of grant aid of up to Pounds 60m being made available on an 'up front' basis. It is a real challenge for ministers and for the IDB to attract industry to Northern Ireland but success on this front is being achieved. In the financial year 1992-93, for example, the IDB obtained ten internationally mobile projects against very severe international competition. These projects represent an investment into Northern Ireland of about Pounds 167m. This achievement was followed by a further very successful year in 1993-94, when 13 projects involving Pounds 259m investment were secured. These successes have been achieved in the face of considerable difficulties. Not least of our burdens have been continuing references to De Lorean which occurred 13 years ago. Since then no less than 112 inward investment projects have come to Northern Ireland and have established successful businesses here. The Northern Ireland project is a commercial venture and is not therefore risk free. However, the willingness of the Hualon corporation to invest about Pounds 160m in Northern Ireland is a welcome indication that successful Asian companies regard us, and Europe, as a good location for extending their businesses. In doing so they join Japanese, Korean, Indonesian and Hong Kong companies already in Northern Ireland.   Companies:-  Hualon Corp.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

The listing by the Northern Ireland Tourist Board of the 'curiosity factor' as an important strength was condemned by politicians and business - even if it was only acknowledging an unspoken truth: that most tourists have previously seen Northern Ireland only in grisly news pictures. Tourist board officials hurriedly made clear that its three-year corporate plan did not propose the marketing of bus tours to terrorist-hit areas of west Belfast, or listing bed and breakfast accommodation along the 'peace line'. The emphasis would be on increasing understanding about the 'troubles', they said. The corporate plan says many visitors 'may be motivated to visit simply to see why there should be such conflict in modern society'. Mr William Hastings, chief executive of the Hastings hotel group, said the board was mistaken. 'The conflict still exists. Were it over, then some places, like the walls which divide the Shankill and the Falls may be of some interest. But I think we have many other things of much greater interest to offer the tourist,' he said. Mr John Taylor, Ulster Unionist MP, said: 'You don't help the tourist industry by drawing attention to the troubles.' The Northern Ireland Office is keen to promote tourism, believing there is scope for growth - some 263,000 holidaymakers are estimated to have visited last year. But until now explicit mention of conflict has been shunned in favour of Northern Ireland's scenic beauty.  The Financial Times   London Page 8  "
0,FT933-4350 ,"FT933-4350 _AN-DIIB8ADAFT 930909   FT  09 SEP 93 / Survey of Northern Ireland (5): Chilling commercials do not help - Tourist industry now offers too many attractions for too few tourists      By ROBERT RODWELL   On September 22 a small, narrow-gauge steam train will make its last journey around Lord O'Neill's Shane's Castle estate on the shores of Lough Neagh in County Antrim. Lord O'Neill, who installed the railway in 1971, says that with only 30,000 passengers each year, it did not pay its way. Northern Ireland now offers too many attractions for too few tourists. 'Unless peace breaks out, some of them won't be sustainable. We need to watch the total number and we have to go for quality, not quantity.' He is himself a former chairman of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board (NITB). His remarks strike a chord in the industry. Promotors and proprietors bemoan Ulster's wettest, most sunless summer since reliable records began. Thousands of what would have been the industry's home-trade visitors scrambled for last-minute bookings to seek sunshine elsewhere. Has the province, in a frenetic burst of development activity enthusiastically supported by the NITB and funded with big subventions from both the EC and the International Fund for Ireland, over-catered for the level of tourism it can reasonably expect while its external image remains so poor? Presenting his 1992 annual report, Mr Hugh O'Neill, the present NITB chairman, unabashedly announced that the board was currently involved in the development of some 350 projects. The NITB has just published a brochure on no fewer than 24 developments either just opened or to open by the end of this month. They include multi-million pound 'star attractions' such as the Pounds 4.5m interpretative centre at Navan Fort outside Armagh - the Emain Macha of Gaelic legend, seat of the ancient kings of Ulster. Then there is the Tower museum in Londonderry, which capitalises on the rich history of western Europe's last fortress city with ancient walls intact. A big 'discovery centre' on Lough Neagh will be a success if it does not drive the ambient bird life away. Carrickfergus, on the Antrim coast, hid its magnificent Norman castle behind a screen of enormous oil tanks and paid scant regard to its archaeological heritage - until recently. In July this year the innovative Pounds 2.5m 'Knightride' monorail opened, carrying visitors through tableaux of Carrickfergus's history from 531 AD almost to the present day. Northern Ireland's 26 district councils, deprived of most of the powers enjoyed by their mainland counterparts, have clamoured for grants to exercise their muscle in one of the very few sectors where their writ can run. The upshot is that while the province is not exactly rich in 'heritage and interpretive' centres, provision is unbalanced and some long-standing Ulster assets are ignored. (It remains very difficult, for example, to find a public slipway giving a boat owner easy access to the tidal waters of the 18-mile long Strangford Lough.) With an 80 per cent increase in inquiries this year compared with 1992, the NITB is forecasting an all-time high of 1.5m visitors against last year's total of 1.255m - which itself was a 6 per cent increase on 1991. These figures include business visitors and what the trade calls VFR (visiting friends and relatives) traffic, with the number of purely discretionary 'real' holidaymakers in the minority. In this category, visitors from both Britain and the Republic declined by 7 and 17 per cent respectively last year. Ulster's tourist trade pales into insignificance beside that of competing regions. Its estimated tourism earnings of Pounds 162m last year accounted for just 2 per cent of Ulster's gdp. Scotland's accounted for 9 per cent of regional gdp against an estimated overall figure of 5 per cent for Great Britain. The Republic's tourist industry contributed 7 per cent to the Irish gdp. If its image were not such a depressant, on a pro rata basis Northern Ireland could reasonably expect more than 5m visitors a year. If there is little recovery in the numbers of visitors originating from or passing through the Republic of Ireland this year, the Northern Ireland Office should take some of the blame. In an astonishing display of what some tourist interests call witlessness, the Northern Ireland Office began running a series of chilling commercials on Ulster Television, featuring make-believe terrorist murders (ironically, filmed in Scotland), in the hope of persuading more Ulster people to become police informers by means of the confidential recording telephones. 'Don't suffer it. Change it', ran the punchline. Transmission began just as the NITB launched its most ambitious high-season TV advertising campaign yet: two handsome commercials transmitted throughout the Republic of Ireland and Scotland. But the terrorism commercials - designed purely for Northern Ireland consumption - would have been received and viewed by millions in the larger, more populous part of the Republic. The deterrent effect on intending visitors can only be imagined. It may not have been quite as bad, however, as the effect of this year's appalling summer. 'Trade from the Republic is particularly susceptible to the weather. We have reports of people booking and not showing up, or leaving early because of constant rain,' says Hugh O'Neill. As Mr Geoff Hill, travel editor of the Newsletter, a Northern Ireland morning paper, wrote recently: 'Booking an Ulster summer holiday has always been like looking for a job in the tourist board. 'Wimps' need not apply.'   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P9611 Administration of General Economic Programs.     P79   Amusement and Recreation Services.

Last year the go-ahead was given for a gas pipeline from Scotland to Ulster. Sir Patrick said: 'The European Commission will be contributing 35 per cent of the costs of the interconnector as it fits in very well with the policy of trans-European networks.' He said an interconnector would end the isolation of the Northern Ireland electricity system and increase security of supply. But he stressed the go-ahead was subject to planning permission. Mr William Ross, Ulster Unionist MP for Londonderry East, said it was vital that Northern Ireland's electricity industry was allowed to compete fairly via the interconnector in supplying power. Sir Patrick said it would be advantageous if there was competition introduced into the supply of electricity to Ulster. But Labour's Mr George Foulkes (Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley) protested: 'It will bring expensive electricity from Scotland, rather than cheaper electricity generated in Northern Ireland from lignite, coal and gas.' Sir Patrick said the claims of lignite would be taken into account.   Countries:-  QRZ  European Economic Community (EC).     IEZ  Ireland, EC.   Industries:-  P1623 Water, Sewer and Utility Lines.

Mr Nicholas Winterton, Conservative MP for Macclesfield, is seeking a meeting on the subject with Mr Tim Smith, the Northern Ireland minister. Mr Winterton, chairman of the Manufacturing and Construction Industries Alliance, an industry pressure group, said he was 'bitterly disappointed' by replies from Mr Smith to a series of parliamentary questions. He described the decision to earmark aid for the Pounds 157m project as 'one of those great civil service blunders that have affected British industry for several years'. Mr Christopher Whitehouse, the alliance's chief executive, said: 'We want it stopped.' Mr Winterton's remarks came a week after it emerged that the recently established Commons Northern Ireland committee is to probe aspects of the project as part of its inquiry into employment creation in the province. The plant - to be built by a Malaysian division of Hualon, a Taiwanese conglomerate - will represent the largest industrial investment in Northern Ireland since the failed De Lorean car venture. It became the subject of controversy in May, when it emerged that the European Commission overrode strong objections from its own officials in approving the UK government grant. In his answers Mr Smith said the government had no plans to review its decision to assist the project, which it had concluded would not cause any significant job displacement in the UK. Sir David Alliance, chairman of Coats Viyella, Europe's largest textiles company, has warned that 'as many as 1,000 jobs in Lancashire' could be lost because of the project.

0,FT922-10581 ,"FT922-10581 _AN-CD3BPADQFT 920430   FT  30 APR 92 / Survey of Relocation in The UK (16): A centre for advanced communications - Northern Ireland now claims to have one of the most advanced fibre-optic telecom networks in Europe      By TIM COONE   A PERSON dialling directory enquiries in London might be somewhat bemused these days to find the operator answering in a broad Ulster accent. The reason is that around 10 per cent of all London directory enquiries, or 40,000 calls per day, are now routed through Portadown, 20 miles outside Belfast. Thanks to fibre optics, 200 operators in Northern Ireland, linked to a computer database in Sheffield, can do the job more cheaply and as efficiently as a similar number in London. Northern Ireland now claims to have one of the most advanced fibre-optic telecommunications networks anywhere in Europe. It is one of the chief selling points that Northern Ireland's Industrial Development Board (IDB) is keen to impress upon visiting business executives curious about relocation or inward investment in the province. British Telecom's Pounds 100m investment in the network, which began five years ago, and is continuing with an additional Pounds 40m per year in upgrading, has converted all the trunk routes to optic fibres. The system can thus cope with high density data transmission and conference networking. A BT spokesman says that the network puts Northern Ireland on a par with London and other leadinging European capitals 'with the difference that the network extends throughout the province. No opportunity for inward investment need be lost for the lack of advanced telecommunications.' 'It cuts away this idea of peripherality,' says Ms Janet McIver the director of the Northern Ireland Business Centre in London, an IDB marketing arm. She says that the transfer of 'back-office' data processing activities to Northern Ireland is now a prime focus of IDB's marketing effort. 'This has been our main success story in the British market and is a very important and exciting possibility for the future,' she says. Around 1,500 jobs have been created in Northern Ireland in the past two years as a result of relocation of data processing activities. Besides BT, the UK's Department of Social Security has relocated its claims processing to Belfast from its offices in seven London boroughs including Brixton and Lewisham. Five hundred staff process some 160,000 claims per week. The passport office is processing nationwide passport applications out of Belfast. In the private sector, Nationwide Anglia is processing UK mortgage accounts out of Northern Ireland, and Prudential Assurance has transferred its UK life assurance claims processing activities to Belfast. Mr Keith Bedell-Pearce the chief executive of Prudential Financial Services says: 'A combination of staff shortages and the fact that we were simply running out of space at our Reading offices forced us to look for alternative solutions.' He adds that the choice of Belfast has been an 'outstanding success.' Better-qualified staff availability, and low personnel turnover has meant that the same volume of work is now being handled by fewer employees - 'the cost of recruitment, induction and on-going training is minimised,' he says. Computer training begins at an early age in Ulster's schools. Some 500 graduates in computer studies emerge from Ulster's two universities each year. Together they provide a large pool of computer-literate labour. Ms McIver says that wage costs in the data processing industry are some 10-20 per cent lower in Northern Ireland compared with UK. Relocation of manufacturing industry has been less of a success story than in the services industry, although according to Mr John McGuckian, the newly appointed chairman of IDB, 'for internationally mobile projects we are competitive with anywhere.' Capital grants of up to 30 per cent are available, as well as additional 20 per cent grants in high unemployment areas of Northern Ireland. Assistance is also available for RD, training and marketing and certain relocation costs of staff and Mr MrGuckian says 'we pride ourselves on our after-sales service. Some of our best envoys have been those that have already established themselves here.' AVX, a leading electronic components manufacturer last year chose the port of Larne in Northern Ireland, as the base for its European distribution centre. According to Mr Greg McMahon, AVX's European Distribution Manager, 'far more important than geography in a distribution operation these days are management skills - skills in inventory control, in negotiating the most efficient and economical form of transport, and in meeting the precise requirements of customers.' Company executives who have moved from the mainland to Belfast point to the good schools, cheaper housing, (as much as half the cost of that available on the mainland), and uncongested roads as well as the variety of outdoor leisure activities - such as golf, sailing, hill-walking and horse-riding - that are available within 30 minutes' drive of Belfast. Their surprisingly sanguine view of the 'troubles' perhaps has something to do with the police statistics which reveal that the risk associated with terrorist-related crime in Northern Ireland is substantially less than the risk of being a victim of violent crime in most cities on the mainland. Mr McGuckian comments: 'It is true we are a divided community, but enormous efforts are being made to solve that problem. The reality is that it has little or no impact on running a successful industry here.' Trying to convince outsiders of that though is IDB's most formidable task, and no-one doubts that political stability would provide the 'missing ingredient' to make Northern Ireland a highly attractive region for relocation. Fresh hopes for a political solution await the next round of inter-party talks, due to begin next month.  The Financial Times   London Page IX  "

He said tourist numbers to Northern Ireland rose last year for the fifth consecutive year. Final figures for have still to be compiled, but tourist inquiries and hotel occupancy rates showed increases over 1992 for the first half, with inquiries up 70 per cent. Last year the NITB launched a marketing campaign which, for the first time, used television advertising in the Republic of Ireland, Scotland and northern England. The NITN has also expandedoffice representation in Europe, North America and Australasia. Investment in the tourist industry in the province is estimated at Pounds 200m over the past five years. Mr O'Neil said: 'While much of this development has been provided by the public sector we expect it to be a stimulus to investment from the private sector in 1994, particularly in new accommodation.' In 1992, the last year for which complete figures are available, there were 1.25m visitors to Northern Ireland. One in five of these were purely for holiday purposes, 500,000 were visiting friends or relatives, while 500,000 were on business or for 'other purposes'. Larne, the main commercial and passenger port between the UK and Northern Ireland, reported a record of 1.8m passengers last year, an increase of 10.4 per cent. Car and caravan numbers rose 12.7 per cent to 414,000, while commercial vehicles rose to 364,000 and cargo handled reached 4.3m net tonnes, all breaking previous records. The government is to spend Pounds 2.5m refurbishing Northern Ireland's parliament building at Stormont in Belfast. The building, opened in 1932, needs work including new water and electrical services. The parliament was dissolved in 1972 when London introduced direct rule.

0,FT944-18429 ,"FT944-18429 _AN-EJDDVACJFT 941004   FT  04 OCT 94 / Ayrshire pylons inquiry opens      By JAMES BUXTON   The plan to run a line of pylons across south Ayrshire to take power from Scotland to Northern Ireland is to be considered at a public inquiry which opens in Ayr today and is likely to last more than two months. The 40-mile line of pylons is part of a proposed interconnector whereby ScottishPower will supply Northern Ireland Electricity with 250MW of power. The project will cost Pounds 175m. The European Union has promised a grant of Pounds 61m and ScottishPower will invest Pounds 20m. The project has attracted strong opposition in Ayrshire from a campaign group called Stop the Overhead Powerlines - otherwise known simply as Stop - which argues that the pylons will ruin some of the finest scenery in Scotland, pose a hazard to health and damage the local economy. They will also contend that Northern Ireland Electricity has cheaper alternatives to importing power from Scotland. The inquiry will consider the environmental arguments, and examine the need for the interconnector and its consequences for the national and local economy. Northern Ireland Electricity believes that the interconnector is the best solution for meeting its projected shortfall in power after 1997. Scottish Power sees the project as a way of increasing output and maximising utilisation of its coal-burning power stations. It will argue that the project should thus benefit the Scottish economy, especially by providing increased demand for coal from the Scottish coalfield, shortly to be privatised. The interconnector would involve building more than 200 pylons from a site near Ayr to Ballantrae in south-west Ayrshire. There will also be a cable across the Irish Sea. Kyle and Carrick district council, across which the pylons would run, is one the leading objectors. However, a consultants' report commissioned by the council concluded that the project would bring substantial economic benefits to Scotland and was the only way to meet Northern Ireland's power shortfall. The government is not obliged to adopt special precautions under European law to safeguard children from exposure to possible health risks from new underground power cables, two High Court judges ruled yesterday. Three children from London, acting through their fathers, applied for court orders requiring Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, to fulfil his duty to protect the public and direct the National Grid to ensure that fields from new cables do not exceed levels which latest research suggests are safe. The children live in South Woodford, where National Grid is laying a high-voltage underground cable. Their parents fear dangerous electromagnetic fields could increase the risk of childhood leukaemia and other cancers. Their lawyers argued that changes in European law required member states to act on 'precautionary' principles when carrying out legal duties. But Lord Justice Farquharson and Mrs Justice Smith refused their application for judicial review. The parents are considering an appeal to the Court of Appeal and then, if still unsuccessful, taking their case to the European Court of Justice.   Companies:-  ScottishPower.

While the Industrial Development Board, the province's main jobs agency, has recently reported successes in attracting overseas investment, a number of local companies are experiencing difficulties in securing orders. Harland and Wolff, the Belfast shipbuilder which currently employs 2,000 people, has said recently it is prepared to build a ship at a loss in order to protect continuity of employment. Province-wide estimates suggest that employment in the security sector, which includes the Royal Ulster Constabulary and private security firms could fall by as much as 20,000. Conversely, the tourism industry in Northern Ireland is expected to thrive on the prospect of peace. At present the industry employs about 10,000 people and is worth about Pounds 130m to the local economy. It is felt these figures could double if peace is genuine. It has always been clear that the achievement of peace would lead to a reassessment of public spending priorities in the province. Yesterday the Northern Ireland Economic Council, in its Autumn Economic Review made clear that the government should not consider removing money from Northern Ireland. Its report said: 'To argue that 'peace' will bring more costs than benefits seems perverse in the extreme . . . What is important is that the adjustment problems that will arise are dealt with carefully, sensitively and gradually. 'With regard to the substantial opportunities that would open up in the longer term, it is imperative that these are exploited to the full.' The report maintained that the latest economic indicators appeared to suggest that local manufacturing output was continuing to outperform Britain.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

0,FT933-4357 ,"FT933-4357 _AN-DIIB8AC3FT 930909   FT  09 SEP 93 / Survey of Northern Ireland (1): Signs of change are in the wind - Terrorist violence continues, but the economy is looking up, business confidence is strong, and cross-border economic co-operation brings hope for better political relations      By TIM COONE   'There have been no bombings or sectarian-linked murders in Northern Ireland now for the past five years. 'The so-called 'permanent ceasefire' by the IRA and Loyalist paramilitaries has held, and British troop levels in the province have been reduced to only 10 per cent of what they were in 1993. 'Negotiators from the unionist and nationalist camps, together with representatives of the British and Irish governments, under EC chairmanship, are now entering their final phase of negotiations for a permanent settlement of a dispute that has divided the people of the island since 1921. 'The settlement plan is expected to be put to a simultaneous referendum in both parts of Ireland within six months of the signing of the agreement by all parties'. OF course such a scenario is futuristic fiction. But it is not fantasy. For this vision of a future settlement is central to the only publicly-acknowledged political dialogue taking place in Northern Ireland since the round-table talks between the main political parties in the province broke down with no agreement last November. That dialogue is between Mr John Hume, the leader of the Social Democratic Labour Party (SDLP), and Mr Gerry Adams, the leader of Sinn Fein - the political wing of the IRA. Attacked by the Unionists for what they say is an effort to form a 'pan-nationalist front', Mr Hume says the dialogue is 'about agreeing an overall strategy for a lasting peace - and an overall strategy includes everybody. 'It is not a joint strategy as some people have tried to make out . . . what I want is a complete and utter cessation of violence on all sides . . . Gerry Adams is very serious, and the people he represents are very serious about these talks and their objectives'. So Mr Hume says: 'I have never felt more hopeful in 20 years than I do now.' There are other grounds for believing that some change might be in the wind. While the IRA's bombing campaign and the Loyalists' killings of Catholics show no sign of letting up, the language of Sinn Fein has taken on a decidedly more moderate and conciliatory tone over the past year. Sinn Fein spokespersons now talk of 'inclusive dialogue' and 'recognition of the Unionist identity'. They even say that a united Ireland - their preferred option - might not necessarily be the end result of a negotiating process. Presbyterian ministers have been holding secret talks with paramilitary leaders on both sides over the past year, while the outlawed Loyalist Ulster Defence Association (UDA) recently announced that it is prepared to meet and talk to Archbishop Cathal Daly, the Catholic primate. The Opsahl Commission, an independent body set up in 1992 to sound out a broad range of public opinion from across the province, concluded earlier this year that there is a strong desire for political compromise to end the violence - a message from the constituencies which, apparently, many of the province's politicians have still not heard. Intriguing reports have also appeared, over the summer, of secret negotiations between the army and the IRA on a 60-point military de-escalation plan. These have been strenuously denied by both the Northern Ireland Office and Sinn Fein, but they add to a more general impression that although the mainstream political process has ended up in limbo, nonetheless intensive efforts are being made behind the scenes to broker a peace. The key to whether Mr Hume can now succeed in his more public efforts to achieve a cessation of hostilities, as a means of getting everybody around the negotiating table, will be whether the British government's stated position that it has no strategic interest in Northern Ireland, that it is neutral in the conflict, and has no preferred option for a settlement, will stand up under the strains of Westminster politics. Just before the summer recess at Westminster, the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) led by Mr James Molyneaux, voted with Mr John Major and his Conservative party on a finely-balanced Maastricht vote. Mr Molyneaux announced that the UUP would be giving its support to the Conservatives for the remaining life of the present parliament, but simultaneously denied that any deal had been struck with the Tories. But there now exist high expectations among Unionist politicians in the province that long sought after changes in the administration of Northern Ireland will take place over the next two years. These include the establishment of a parliamentary select committee on Northern Ireland, and for more powers to be handed over to local councils from the Northern Ireland Office (NIO). One UUP councillor in Londonderry says: 'We have discussed and been lobbying for this at Westminster for some time.' If such changes were to be implemented unilaterally, the Irish government has already indicated that it would consider this tantamount to a violation of the 1985 Anglo-Irish Treaty. Mr Hume says: 'Any secret agreement between the British government and one party in Northern Ireland would have no chance of succeeding, particularly if it is related to restoring power to local authorities before it has been clearly established that any such power would be exercised fairly . . . To play party politics of that nature with Northern Ireland in order to stay in power is utterly irresponsible. Everybody will end up paying a price for it including the government that enters into such an agreement.' Abandonment of the talks process, and the adoption of a more unilateralist approach by the UK government, would deal a severe blow to Anglo-Irish relations. Ministers from the two governments meet this week in London to review whether there is any life remaining in the talks process, and indeed whether they can still claim to share a bipartisan approach. The Republic has indicated it might now take a different tack and seek the appointment of a US special envoy to the province. It is thought that such an envoy would not be as constrained about talking to Sinn Fein as would the Irish and British governments. So while fresh approaches may be imminent on the political front, there is also optimism emerging on the economic one. The clouds of recession have already broken up over Northern Ireland and business confidence is now the strongest in years. Unemployment is beginning to fall and retail sales are growing. All these act as spurs to new investment such as that in Londonderry, where Pounds 65m is being spent on a new shopping and office complex in the city which will serve an economic hinterland on both sides of the border. Several important new foreign and local investments have been announced in the past year, and continuing infrastructural improvements in the roads, ports and airports are making the province an increasingly attractive location for both business and tourism. Last year a record number of 1.25m visitors came to Northern Ireland, and a further 20 per cent increase is forecast for this year. Meanwhile, Northern Irish farmers are enjoying rising incomes, despite reforms to the common agricultural policy. The food processing industry appears to be adapting well to the cutbacks in intervention buying; instead, it is successfully exploring new markets within Europe. The continuing importance of agriculture to the economy can be appreciated from the fact that about 50 per cent of exports through the busy ro-ro (roll on, roll off) port of Larne are of agricultural produce. Economic analysts believe that any sustained recovery must await recovery elsewhere in the UK and Europe, and that the severe problem of long-term structural unemployment in the province has still to be adequately addressed. A regeneration of manufacturing industry is considered particularly important, to balance the declines in traditional industries such as shipbuilding, heavy engineering and textiles. The government insists that it is doing all it can; indeed, its Pounds 3bn annual subsidy to Northern Ireland has resulted in a housing and communications infrastructure that is now superior - or at least comparable  -to many other parts of the UK. Ministers argue that it is the IRA bombing campaign and the political violence which are holding back economic growth and the necessary private inward investment. Evidence for that can be found in the city of Londonderry - once the symbol of the 'troubles'. Here, local businessmen are brimming with confidence, 'power-sharing' on the local council has got the politicians working together for the city, and IRA bombs have not been heard for years. That is the picture of Northern Ireland which Mr Hume would like to see replicated in the rest of the province. If, indeed, his talks with Mr Adams are progressing as satisfactorily as he claims, then it need not be so far-fetched to imagine a very different outlook facing Northern Ireland in another year's time.

Excluded from the deal is Express Ireland's 80 per cent interest in Carbery Milk Products, which is to be sold to Carbery Creameries, the minority shareholder which is owned by four Irish dairy co-operatives. The deal is estimated to be worth IPounds 100m (Pounds 93.6m) to GrandMet and ends weeks of speculation over the future ownership of Express Ireland: GrandMet last November revealed plans to reduce its dairy interests in the UK and Ireland to concentrate on more strongly branded segments of the food industry. Last December GrandMet sold its Express Dairy liquid milk business in the UK and its Eden Vale chilled products business to Northern Foods for Pounds 359m. Since then, as many as 10 contenders have been negotiating the takeover of Express Ireland in a battle between Irish food groups for scale and market share. Express Ireland comprises: Carbery milk products, the Republic's biggest cheesemaker; Virginia Milk Products, which supplies cream to Bailey's, the GrandMet subsidiary which makes cream liqueur; Premier Dairies, the main liquid milk supplier to the Dublin market; and an Italian-style cheese production plant in Northern Ireland. Waterford's main interests are in: Premier, in which it already has a 50 per cent stake; Virginia, which purchases about half of Premier's milk supplies; and the Northern Ireland plant at Magheraglin, although this last may subsequently be sold off. As part of the deal, Virginia will continue to supply cream for the production of Bailey's Original Irish Cream. The deal comes at a difficult time for Waterford, which last October bought United Co-operative Dairies in the north of England for Pounds 37.5m. This followed the 1989 acquisition of Healds Foods, also based in the north of England. The two deals left Waterford with a considerable debt burden of some IPounds 45m. The Express Ireland acquisition is expected to be financed by a rights issue of about IPounds 30m together with long-term debt, and is likely to cost Waterford between IPounds 50m and IPounds 60m after subtracting what Carbery will fetch, and cash reserves within Express Ireland. Stockbrokers in Ireland have been recommending Irish food industry stocks in recent months, and analysts say that a Waterford rights issue would be well-timed now, despite the company's debt.

The number in work in Northern Ireland fell by very little and has remained close to its historically high peak of 1990. Such rise in unemployment as there was can generally be attributed to the arrival of newcomers on the job market. Such are the demographic realities that Northern Ireland has to run fast in its job creation even to stand still in terms of its unemployment rate. From Belfast, observers have been able to take a fairly relaxed view of the tribulations of the British economy since 1989. Although measured from a lower datum line, Ulster's dive was less steep. The big rise in unemployment nationally, particularly in southern England, was no more than what Northern Ireland had gone through in the early 1980s with the disappearance of much of its manufacturing base. Two factors in particular explain the gentleness of Ulster's dive. One is its heavy dependence for employment on the relatively recession-proof public sector. It accounts for some 40 per cent of employment, according to Doctor Vani Barooah, professor of applied economics at the University of Ulster. 'The spending of that 40 per cent means that about 70 per cent of jobs are ultimately dependent upon the public sector.' Equally important is the absence of the speculative property boom which occurred in Great Britain during the late 1980s. It simply did not happen in Northern Ireland. House prices rose steadily, but there was none of the dramatic surge which led so many people into high mortgages and, with market slump, into the negative equity trap. There have been no significant repossessions: if you have a job at all in Northern Ireland you are unlikely to be crippled by a mortgage you can no longer afford. Disposable incomes have not, therefore, been under such heavy pressure; the Northern Ireland public has continued to spend to an extent which causes many first-time visitors to express surprise at apparent prosperity where the image had been one of deprivation. But confidence has been bruised by the national gloom. It is rated low-to-medium rather than medium-to-high by Paddy Murphy, chief executive of the Bank of Ireland in Northern Ireland: 'We are seeing a very slow pick-up  -slower than we would have expected.' While the Bank of Ireland reports a 60 per cent increase in mortgage business this year over last, some of this is accounted for by considerable growth in its market share. But credit demand among companies is also markedly up. Mr Murphy says: 'There have been a lot of approvals recently, but borrowers are slow to draw the money. They're getting ready for expansion, but the trigger to make them go is still not there.' That cannot be said for Ulster's largest family firm, Desmond and Sons, garment manufacturer, which recently announced a Pounds 24m expansion which will add 600 jobs and a new plant to the 2,700 workers in 11 locations already. The announcement gave particular satisfaction to economic planners in Belfast because this investment is in the province's poorest region, west of the river Bann. Moreover, it is being made by an indigenous, locally-owned company rather than some remote multi-national with no deep commitment to the province. 'A number of people we're working with are looking at projects, at acquisitions. They haven't all acquired them, but six months ago they weren't even looking. There is a re-awakened interest in new activity,' says Mr Tony Hopkins, managing partner in Northern Ireland of Touche Ross, accountants. Mr Hopkins brings a particular perspective to a region where, he says, the close intermeshing of public and private sector decision makers is unique in the UK. For 10 years until June last year, he was on the staff of the Northern Ireland Industrial Development Board - the last four years as its chief executive. He pays tribute to the way in which successive governments have shaped policies, for 20 years, to the local need rather than the national dogma of the day. Mr Hopkins claims that Northern Ireland managers are now considerably more professional and competent than a decade or so ago: 'The message of competitiveness is now well embedded. They have got out into the export markets and overcome the diffidence factor. The business basics are now right, and there is a great bank of talent coming out of the schools and universities. The province is well poised - and the last year has been good for inward investments.' No local observer would argue with Professor Barooah's contention that closing the big employment gap between Northern Ireland and mainland Britain will require radical restructuring and regeneration of the province's manufacturing base. 'As an engine for employment generation, the public sector has run out of steam. The only sector which isn't reliant on public largesse has to be manufacturing and that is the sector which has run down most in the past 40 years.' The years are long gone when Belfast alone was a world centre in several industries now much diminished: shipbuilding; linen; ropes; textile machinery and tobacco. There must be closer links between finance and industry and a pro-active policy to back winners - on the lines of East Asian 'tigers' (Japan, Korea and Taiwan) - says Professor Barooah. He and others look enviously at the Irish Republic's success in attracting the so-called 'sunrise' industries despite an industrial infrastructure much less advanced than that in Ulster. It is a reminder of what might have been achieved were it not for the effects of more than 20 years of political instability and terrorism. Business interests are themselves trying to produce some easing in the political stalemate on which terrorism thrives. The Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry has for some months been holding unpublicised working breakfasts with the various party leaders; sell-out occasions at which the politicians have been implored by the assembled membership to work together for the province's economic good. 'First results have been encouraging but we have a long way to go. There is an amazing amount of agreement between them on economic issues and how to achieve our aims,' says Paddy Murphy, in his other role as the chamber's vice-president. 'So far we've only hosted them apart. The next step will be to get them together.'   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P9311 Finance, Taxation, and Monetary Policy.

Gone are the times when a trip to market was little more than an outing to a provincial town 20 miles away. Today the world is smaller: produce from the province's farms and factories is sold in far flung places. And greater interest is being taken in what the industry has to offer, not only in the way of foodstuffs, but also in livestock on the land. For example, buyers from as far away as Korea have made no fewer than four visits to Northern Ireland in search of pedigree pig breeding lines. On their most recent trip, last month, they picked up 120 high quality boars, bringing the number ofanimals they have bought in the province to a total of 500. It was an outbreak of Blue Ear disease among the mainland pig population in Britain that first focused Korean attention on Northern Ireland pig farms. Like many visitors before them, the Koreans have discovered that Northern Ireland has an enviable animal health record. Because it is part of a small island, Northern Ireland's 'clean and green' image is second to none. This has been reinforced over the past couple of years, since the introduction, by the Northern Ireland Livestock Marketing Commission, of a Farm Quality Assured Scheme for beef and lamb. To date the scheme has attracted some 3,251 farmers who between them account for 69 per cent of the annual beef slaughterings in Northern Ireland. Beef from the province is now marketed in Holland under the Greenfields label, through the Albert Heijn supermarket chain which dictates that supplies are from Quality Assured farms. A party of six Northern Ireland representatives of meat companies, on a mission to find niche markets, flew to Brussels two months ago, taking with them local beef and lamb for a special dinner. As a result of their trip they have identified significant sales outlets for both products; they intend to increase sales orders to Belgium. With the prospect of a steep decline in the level of EC Intervention buying, an increase in marketing missions from Northern Ireland is to be expected. Three years ago, some 40 per cent of all slaughterings in Northern Ireland were sold into Intervention, and the fact that this facility could drop to about 10 per cent in two to three years is a sobering thought for those who market meat. On a more cheerful note, Northern Ireland farmers have been offered an opportunity to supply two important continental supermarket groups with bull beef. Mr Brendan McGahan, chief executive of the Livestock Marketing Commission, says: 'The Edah group, which specifies young bulls, is presently beingsupplied by Dutch and French farmers. It sees supplies from its own country becoming scarcer as stocking rates, fertiliser use restrictions and quota considerations begin to reduce stock numbers on their supply farms.' For years, dairy farmers throughout Great Britain and Northern Ireland have used their own milk marketing boards. Now that is coming to an end. Something of a 'milk war' has developed in the province between Nestle, the international giant, which has a factory at Omagh in Co Tyrone; Strathroy Milk Marketing, which is based nearby; Pritchitt Foods of Newtownards; Dale Farm, which is part of the Northern Foods operation; and Leckpatrick Dairies, which is now owned by Cork-based Golden Vale. All have one thing in common: they want to link up with the province's dairy farmers - there are more than 6,000 - in direct purchase contracts. As it dies, the Milk Marketing Board (MMB) is asking producers to help form a voluntary co-operative - but the future of Dromona Quality Foods, the MMB's marketing arm, is a bone of contention. The MMB wants to retain it, under the umbrella of the new co-operative; the Northern Ireland Dairy Trades Federation and several processors want a divorce between the MMB and Dromona. The Office of Fair Trading's opinion is that 'the continued retention of Dromona Quality Foods within the new co-operative would be unwelcome in competition'. Dairy farmers can speak no ill of Dromona Quality Foods - its profitability brought them a handout of Pounds 1.8m in July this year. Furthermore, Dromona has just announced a 26 per cent increase in its annual profit, to Pounds 3.4m, having enjoyed its best-ever trading performance - its turnover increased by Pounds 10m to Pounds 78m despite the MMB paying 16 per cent more for milk supplies. Mr Jim Noble, Dromona's managing director, says: 'The past year was one of challenge and opportunity in the dairy market both at home and internationally.' Expanded sales to Great Britain and Europe, coupled with aggressive marketing on the international scene through Halib Foods International, has contributed to the success. Halib, the wholly-owned, exporting subsidiary of Dromona Quality Foods, has just clinched orders worth Pounds 1.6m to supply milk powder to three important new overseas outlets in, respectively, El Salvador, Bangladesh and a Central African state. It is hoped that this could develop into long term business worth Pounds 6.5m a year. Looking at Northern Ireland's farms during the past year, the most recent government statistics show gross output rising by 9 per cent to Pounds 935m in 1992, while expenditure rose by 3 per cent to Pounds 513m. Total income from farming in the province - a land area about the size of Yorkshire - rose by 24 per cent to Pounds 224m. The Department of Agriculture says that in real terms, after allowing for inflation, this represents a rise of 20 per cent to a level well above the 1980s average. Provisional estimates of gross annual capital investment in agriculture indicate little change from the relatively low level of investment in 1991. At Pounds 103m, total investment was less than 1 per cent above the level of the previous year. While investment in plant, machinery and vehicles fell by 7 per cent to Pounds 45m, investment in buildings and works rose by 7 per cent to Pounds 58m, almost all the increase taking place under the Agricultural Development Operational Programme. The beef breeding herd increased by 4 per cent, to 264,000 cows, during the past year; but numbers of dairy cows fell by 2 per cent, to 269,000. A slower rate of expansion in the sheep flock continued in 1992, with a 2 per cent increase in both the breeding flock and total sheep numbers. (But at 2.6m there are still more sheep than people in Northern Ireland.) Cattle account for 33 per cent, sheep for 8.9 per cent of Northern Ireland's total receipts. The dairy sector at 26.3 per cent, the poultry and eggs sector at 10.6 per cent and the efforts of pigs producers, with 9.1 per cent, make up much of the remainder. Horticulture, at 4 per cent, contributes more than crops, which produce only 3.4 per cent of farming receipts; other small items make up 4.7 per cent. Ulster farmers will say that things on the land are just as difficult as they ever were . . . but they will continue to make a living from it. In the wider context, Northern Ireland expertise in food and farming is widely used around the world, especially in the Middle East, where the Masstock Organisation has been 'greening the desert' for more than a decade. Now the spotlight falls on Russia. Researchers from the faculty of agriculture and food science at Queen's University, Belfast, are spearheading an EC-funded project aimed at improving the efficiency of the supply of fresh produce and dairy products in Russia. The Queen's team is part of a consortium which has won funding of Pounds 650,000 under the Community's Tacis programme - Technical Assistance to the Commonwealth of Independent States and Georgia - to lead an investigation co-ordinated by Northern Ireland Public Sector Enterprises Ltd. The consortium will carry out a study of the milk, fruit and vegetable sectors and establish a food control programme in the Serpukhov district and Pushchino municipality, part of the Moscow region, about 100 kilometres south of the capital. The project is seeking to help with the privatisation of Russian farms and food distribution organisations.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

0,FT944-4190 ,"FT944-4190 _AN-ELIDCADYFT 941209   FT  09 DEC 94 / The peace prize: Investment in N Ireland could benefit Britain      By STEWART DALBY   As Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, addresses the international investment conference in Northern Ireland next Wednesday, he will almost certainly be aware that Britain could reap considerable dividends from peace in the province. The UK exchequer currently subsidises Northern Ireland to the tune of Pounds 3.5bn annually. This is the net subvention after taxes and other receipts, and excludes the direct costs of the British army presence, which could add a further Pounds 500m to the bill. In total, the province is costing UK taxpayers the equivalent of about 2p on income tax. Government spending per head of Northern Ireland's 1.6m population is about 50 per cent higher than for the UK as a whole. Security does not account for all of this difference. Public spending per head is also higher in industry, agriculture, health and education. Subsidies to these areas, with spending on security deducted, accounts for approximately 20 per cent of the province's gross domestic product of nearly Pounds 12bn. The evidence of such large subsidies is manifest. The modern port at Larne is considered more efficient than Dublin's, and handles much of the Republic's exports. Some of the new housing estates in inner-city areas rate among the best in the UK. The transport system is heavily subsidised, and the capacity of the province's road network far exceeds traffic needs. The province also receives money from the European Union, under the Objective 1 programme, targeted at areas on Europe's fringes with per capita income of less than 75 per cent of the EU average. The province is due to receive Pounds 1bn between 1994 and 1999 from EU structural funds under this programme. Objective 1 finance paid for a recent expansion of Belfast International Airport, which is now handling 2.3m passengers a year on direct flights to 11 destinations. It also funded the installation of electricity on Rathlin Island, the only inhabited island in the province. The moves towards peace are generating further aid commitments. EU leaders are expected to agree new aid to bolster the peace plan at today's Essen summit. These peace grants could total Ecu300m (Pounds 233m) between 1995 and 1999. Mr John Hume, leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party, has been a tireless and successful fundraiser for Northern Ireland. He was instrumental in setting up the multinational International Fund for Ireland, which promotes cross-border co-operation with the Republic of Ireland. This fund has drawn contributions from the US as well as the EU, and now stands at Dollars 150m. Sir George Quigley, former permanent secretary at the finance department of the Northern Ireland Office and now chairman of Ulster Bank, defends the level of spending, claiming that in Northern Ireland special factors are at work. 'Given the unique situation here with sectarian divisions, and employment problems it has been necessary to spend money to achieve a degree of stabilisation. It is important to try and mop up unemployment.' In education, for example, extra spending is needed to fund three different kinds of schools: church schools, predominantly Protestant state schools and non-sectarian state schools, he says. He also points out, as do many others, that Northern Ireland has the best A-level results in the UK. Spending on health and hospitals has been necessary not just because of the violence, he says, but also because Belfast and Londonderry have suffered from inner-city deprivation, leading to higher than average levels of ill-health. However, Sir George concedes that Northern Ireland has become a largely public sector economy - described by many commentators as a dependency culture. Forty per cent of those in work are employed by the public sector, double the UK average. In particular, the security industries have been an important provider of jobs, especially for Protestants, with 12,000 full- and part-time members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary. There are also 6,300 full- and part-time members of the locally recruited Royal Irish Regiment. Jobs in the police mean income and mortgages and money pumped into local economies. And Northern Ireland has the highest level of unemployment in the UK. Its traditional industries such as shipbuilding, engineering and textiles have been in long-term decline, with manufacturing accounting for 18 per cent of employment. The violence created difficulties in attracting outside investment, and inward investment has been drawn only through the liberal use of grants. This year the Industrial Development Board for Northern Ireland will spend Pounds 148m in attracting new investment, in one of the most expensive job creation schemes in the UK. However, the alternative - unemployment - has also placed a heavy burden on government spending. At 12.7 per cent, the jobless rate in Northern Ireland reflects the higher proportion of women in the labour force than in the rest of the UK. But it has also been exacerbated by the birth rate, which is the highest in western Europe - higher even than the Republic of Ireland. This has generated a constant stream of young entrants to the labour market, even after allowing for emigration. Against this background, Sir George estimates that a lasting peace could mean a loss of 20,000 jobs, which would be a considerable addition to the 100,000 already out of work. Ultimately, peace will mean a reduction of the public sector's role. Of course, the job losses would not happen all at once; the dependency would not end overnight; and Mr Major cannot expect to cut the public bill very quickly. In the longer term, employment is likely to be created in a revived tourism industry and from closer integration with the Republic, but it will not compensate for jobs lost in the public sector unless there is considerable inward investment.

Northern Ireland Electricity, which is set to become a public limited company at the end of March, with possible flotation towards the end of the year, lost its Yorkshire-born chief executive Tony Hadfield who was lured to Newcastle last October as the new managing director of Northern Electric. NIE has now found a replacement in 41-year-old Ulsterman Patrick Haren (below left), who has been in Dublin in recent years as new business investment director of the Electricity Supply Board in the Republic. As NIE battles its way between the competition-minded department of economic development and an array of Ulster politicians fearful of job losses and fighting to defend the 'public sector ethic', it is far from clear quite what sort of organisation Haren will head from March 31. Meanwhile, economist Geoffrey Horton (below right) is to become director general of the province's electricity regulator which is designed to come into being on April 1. Stephen Littlechild, director-general of Offer, the electricity regulator in England and Wales, had declined the northern Ireland post saying his workload was too heavy. The Northern Irish Offer will be a separate entity, but with close links enabling it to tap into the experience of the longer established regulator. Horton himself will be based in Birmingham, spending perhaps two days a week in the province. Horton, who is 40, has also been working part-time as a consultant to the National Economic Research Associates although he will give this up when he takes on Northern Ireland. He previously worked at the Department of Energy and played a significant part in the re-organisation and privatisation of the electricity industry in England and Wales, as well as being involved in setting up the regulatory regime for Northern Ireland.

This compared with Pounds 15m on Pounds 433.5m in 1992 and Pounds 44.1m on Pounds 403.6m in 1991. But the prospectus warns that comparisons are misleading because of the restructuring of the Northern Ireland electricity industry that occurred in 1992. Restructuring costs also accounted for the low result in 1992. The bulk of the 1993 result came from the transmission and distribution business which contributed Pounds 49.3m. But the company made a Pounds 5.1m loss on its appliance retailing business. In its latest financial year, NIE paid a total dividend of Pounds 16.5m. The directors say that they intend to adopt a 'progressive' dividend policy which, all being well, should produce an increase in real terms. The pathfinder reveals that the government will be taking Pounds 70m of the Pounds 85m of cash currently in NIE's balance sheet as repayment for earlier injections into the company. The government, which will retain a special non-voting share, will also have the right to half of any capital gains on asset sales made by the company over a ten-year period. The NIE issue, which is expected to value the company at between Pounds 300m and Pounds 400m, will be priced on June 3. Applications for shares must be in by 10am on June 16. The basis of allocation will be announced on June 21 and dealings are expected to commence at the same time. The government is hoping that up to two thirds of the shares will be bought by retail investors. People who register by June 1 will be entitled to one free share for every ten they hold for three years. NIE customers will have the alternative option of electricity vouchers. Over 600,000 people have registered so far. Payment for the shares will be in two instalments, the first on application and the second on June 28 1994. NIE is the last of the state-owned non-nuclear electricity companies to be privatised. Unlike regional companies in England and Wales, it is also in the transmission business, and it has a different regulator.   Companies:-  Northern Ireland Electricity.

After four months since the signing of Ireland-Britain peace  initiative this is the first time ever that the two countries'  senior officials have launched a fresh effort for overcoming the  existing obstacles. Britain, which is one of the old parties to  the Northern Ireland dispute, through setting certain  preconditions for the participation of Sinn Fein, the political  wing of the Irish Republican Army, at their peace talks has  resulted in prompting this army to view their future peace talks  with pessimism, thus continuing its armed struggles [sentence as  received].    Britain, through setting a precondition for the Irish  Republican Army for putting an end to the armed struggles  without determining any obligation for London in connection with  the withdrawal of its forces, has drawn these talks to a  stalemate.    Political observers believe the presence of 12,000 British  troops as well as a 7,000 strong Ulster police in Northern  Ireland, which are considered as major opposition forces  antagonizing the IRA, are regarded as major obstacles to the  continuation of the peace talks process.    The British Government, contrary to its claims, based on its  interests in resolving the Northern Ireland dispute, still  insists on certain stands which are typical of the continuation  of Britain's dominance in Northern Ireland.    The British Government has hinted at the issue of self-rule  for Northern Ireland in its plan for peace initiative which  means that London refuses to accept the right to sovereignty for  Northern Ireland and is attempting to keep Northern Ireland as a  region under British dominance. Meanwhile, the Protestant  majority residing in Northern Ireland, that enjoys all-out  support and protection of Britain, is yet another obstacle to  the process of peace talks. In order to overcome it, Britain  has to adopt a stance taking into consideration the existing  realities.    Assuredly the British Government is no longer able to resort  to the past methods to suppress the IRA and seek to exercise  military power for the materialization of its political  objectives.    In the meantime, one should note that the IRA, in turn, now  does not see continuation of the armed struggle to be enough for  achieving its goals. That is because the Conservative and Labor  Governments in Britain have demonstrated that they have made  themselves invulnerable to the blows of the army and will  neutralize the effects of such measures and the government's  political decisions. With regard to the fact that the two sides  have obtained great experiences during more than two decades of  struggle, and also in view of the difficulties faced by each  side, it appears that one can assess the future of these talks  optimistically through the presentation of peaceful views by  each side.

0,FT943-3199 ,"FT943-3199 _AN-EIOC7ADEFT 940915   FT  15 SEP 94 / Survey of Northern Ireland (6): Invisible barriers start to fall - North/South trade / Trade links are expected to be substantially improved over the next five years as they are a priority in the Republic's IRPounds 7bn National Development Plan      By JOHN MCMANUS   Trade between Northern Ireland and its nearest neighbour, the Republic of Ireland, is abnormally low - and skewed heavily in favour of the Republic. Northern Ireland's exports to the Republic represent just under eight per cent of the total. Goods and services flowing the other way represent about six per cent of the Republic's total exports. The north's main exports to the Republic are live animals and food products, including beverages, which accounted for around 40 per cent of the Pounds 468m exported in 1992. Other leading exports include fertiliser, textiles and clothing. Food products and live animals account for around 46 per cent of Northern Ireland's imports from the Republic, which were Pounds 825m in 1992. Manufactured goods, including chemicals, industrial machinery and road vehicles, accounted for 47 per cent of imports. The reasons for the low level of trade are both infrastructural and historical. The antipathy of certain parts of the Northern Irish business community to trading with the Republic, and the apprehension of companies in the Republic about trading in Northern Ireland, are widely acknowledged, but unquantifiable. Current political developments may go a long way towards breaking down these invisible trade barriers and complement the efforts made in recent years to overcome the tangible, infrastructural barriers. Over the last three years the two leading business organisations in Ireland, the Confederation of British Industry in Northern Ireland, and the Irish Business and Employers Confederation (Ibec) in the Republic, have undertaken a number of joint initiatives aimed at boosting cross border trade. Between them, Ibec and the CBI represent 4,000 companies and around 90 per cent of manufacturing jobs in Ireland. The advent of the single market in 1992 is seen by many as the catalyst that led the two organisations to look at ways of overcoming obstacles to trade. The single market swept away the biggest of the the physical obstacles: delays at the border for customs and security checks could at one time add up to five hours to the three-hour journey between between Belfast and Dublin. The CBI and Ibec established a joint council in 1991, which drew up a three year North-South market development programme. The programme set out to address what the joint council perceived to be the four biggest obstacles to trade, according to Mr William Poole, the Confederation of British Industry's director of business development for Ireland. The biggest problem, according to Mr Poole, was the lack of available information, in both the Republic and Northern Ireland, about opportunities on the other side of the border. The second main obstacle was perceived to be the poor state of road and rail links between the two parts of Ireland. The two other big problems identified by the joint council were the sort that would be associated with any export market: the risk of adverse currency movements and the difficulties of pursuing payment in a different jurisdiction. The problem of lack of information was addressed through the collation and dissemination of as much information as was available, and the organisation of contact meetings for various industry sectors. 'The core of activity was to bring together companies from North and South, matching buyers with sellers and identifying and promoting market opportunities,' explains Mr Poole. In total, 25 meetings were held, involving 530 companies split more or less evenly between Northern Ireland and the Republic. 'The key sectors in which we believed cross border trade could be encouraged were textiles, food, engineering - including software - and selling to the public sector,' Mr Poole explained. The programme has been highly successful and highlighted the potential for increased cross border trade, Mr Poole maintains. Six Northern Irish food companies won orders worth Pounds 386,000, while four engineering companies have got Pounds lm worth of business. More than 60 sales leads and Pounds 390,000 worth of business were generated by the software companies which took part in the programme, he adds. The joint council is now completing a second programme, which will run for five years and look particularly at the possibility of increasing cross-border trade by small businesses, which are seen as vital creators of new jobs. Northern Ireland's small business sector represents the province's best opportunity for job creation and economic expansion. 'In marketing terms, it makes sound business sense to look at developing export business with a trading partner on our doorstep,' explains Mr Bill Jeffrey, chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses in Northern Ireland. The joint council also commissioned management consultants to produce a study on the potential for the development of an economic corridor between Dublin and Belfast, and this is due for publication shortly. Such a scheme has been mooted by businessmen for many years, with estimates of the number of jobs it could create ranging from 7,000 to 70,000. The report is expected to highlight once again problems in the area of infrastructural links between Northern Ireland and the Republic. The links, however, are expected to be substantially improved over the next five years as they are a priority in the Republic's IRPounds 7bn National Development Plan for spending the next tranche of European Union structural funds. The report is also expected to show that 'what is really lacking is normal relationships between companies because of a lack of interaction,' explains Mr Geoff MacEnroe, the director of IBEC's North-South Business Development Programme. The development of a corridor would give Northern Ireland companies better access to the island's largest concentration of consumers, in Dublin and its surrounding towns. Such a corridor might go some way to to help redress Northern Ireland's trade deficit, which is a relatively recent development. In 1981, Northern Ireland actually enjoyed a small, Pounds 2m trade surplus with the Republic.   Countries:-  IEZ  Ireland, EC.     GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Mr Michael Ancram, Northern Ireland minister, is offering to meet Tory MPs with specific concerns about the province individually or in small groups from next week. Many Conservatives are keen to add their weight to mounting unionist calls for a security clampdown in response to the latest surge in mainland terrorism by the IRA. They are understood to be disappointed with the government's response to date. A top-level committee of cabinet ministers met secretly at Westminster this week to discuss the security situation. The Northern Ireland Office is thought, however, to be reluctant to countenance radical new counter-terrorist measures at such a delicate point in the Anglo-Irish peace initiative. Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, will have a fresh opportunity to gauge the strength of backbench feeling today, when he meets the generally pro-unionist officers of the Tory backbench Northern Ireland committee. This routine get-together will come immediately after Northern Ireland questions in the Commons, when members of the opposition parties will grill Sir Patrick on recent events. The backbench Northern Ireland committee will meet at Westminster later in the afternoon, after which it is thought MPs might press for a meeting with Mr John Major, the prime minister. Meanwhile, the cross-party Commons selection committee expects to decide next week which MPs are to sit on the new Northern Ireland select committee in a move which could pave the way for the body to start work soon after Easter. The decision to set up the select committee is widely seen as a reinforcement of the government's commitment to the province's unionist majority.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

But even the province's most ardent flag-wavers must have dropped their heads in their hands on hearing of the bomb that killed 10 people in Belfast at the weekend. Persuading people to invest is tough enough and the latest atrocity will not help Northern Ireland's Industrial Development Board to attract private investors, whether indigenous or from overseas. Yet persuade them it must, for even though the economy is in better shape now than it was during most of the last decade, Northern Ireland remains the UK's poorest region. It can ill afford an intensification of sectarian violence. Northern Ireland was less affected than any region by the UK recession. In the worst year of the downturn - 1991 - its output was flat, compared with a drop of 2.4 per cent for the UK in total. Similarly, employment was barely affected by the nationwide fall. One helpful factor was the high level of government spending in the region. In 1991-92, government spending per head, including security costs, was Pounds 4,191 in the province, compared with Pounds 2,963 in England, Pounds 3,506 in Scotland and Pounds 3,268 in Wales. But the region was also cushioned by the prudence of its manufacturers and consumers, who entered the recession with a lower burden of debt than their counterparts on the mainland and were thus less exposed to the very high interest rates of 1989-90. As a result, some of Northern Ireland's industrialists are feeling upbeat about prospects. 'Things have suddenly brightened after years of gloom,' said Mr Norman Stewart, company secretary of James Mackie and Son, a west Belfast-based manufacturer of textiles machinery. With orders from China and Africa swelling the order books, Mr Stewart believes the company may soon expand its 300-strong workforce. The company's smart new factory overlooks the Springfield Road, which separates Protestant and Roman Catholic areas. The road is boarded on either side by high barriers to keep the two sides apart and is sometimes referred to as Belfast's Berlin Wall. Mr Stewart admits that the company is a 'political animal' and only survived the 1980s because the government was determined to see the big west Belfast employer survive. But in spite of the company's sensitive location Mr Stewart is more concerned about getting help from the government for overseas contacts and seeing an end to the recession in Europe than he is with the problems of security. At Desmonds, a textiles factory in Derry that supplies exclusively to Marks and Spencer, Mr Sean O'Dwyer, deputy director, said he believed Northern Ireland's troubles could be costing the economy up to 20,000 jobs, but he is optimistic that if places such as Derry - an awkward spot, close to the border and with a large Catholic community - can shake off its bad image, then so can the rest of the country. 'Derry has done very well over the last two years - it has improved its image and there is a lot of optimism in the town,' said Mr O'Dwyer. But in spite of the optimism of individual companies, the Northern Ireland Economic and Research Centre, an independent research organisation, has estimated that output in Northern Ireland would have to grow at about 10 per cent a year to reduce unemployment to the UK average within a decade. That is not likely while the violence continues. Productivity was only 83 per cent of the UK average last year, according to the centre. And although the region's wage levels are low, they are not low enough to outweigh the productivity gap - unit labour costs in manufacturing are 5 per cent to 6 per cent above the UK average. But political problems can only be part of an explanation of the economy's weakness. Mr Tony Dignan of the centre points out that between 1971 and 1991 average gross domestic product growth per annum in the province actually exceeded the UK average. Referring to Saturday's bombing, he said: 'Over the last 20 years you have had more than enough incidents of this type, but Northern Ireland has kept apace. Political uncertainty is something that investors don't like, whether they are foreign or indigenous, but people still get up in the morning and go to work, as they have been doing for the past 20 years.' The deeper problems include the size of the private sector, which last year employed 23.9 per cent of male employees in manufacturing compared with a UK average of 28.6 per cent. By contrast, males in the public sector in Northern Ireland accounted for almost one third of the workforce, compared with one fifth in the UK. For women the figures are even more startling. Last year, 53.9 per cent of female employees worked in public administration in the province compared with a UK average of 44.6 per cent. Many of Northern Ireland's industrialists complain that the overwhelming presence of the public sector holds back development of the private sector. 'The public sector is a very safe haven for a lot of people,' said Mr Nigel Smyth, director of the Confederation of British Industry in Northern Ireland. 'It would be nice to see some of them working in the private sector, but somebody at a reasonable level in public administration can live very pleasantly in Northern Ireland.' Manufacturing is concentrated in old-fashioned areas such as textiles and aerospace, with limited chances of growth. The small-business sector is also relatively underdeveloped. And, according to the CBI, 35 per cent of Northern Ireland's employees have no qualifications - compared with 29 per cent in Great Britain - while the province's population grew twice as fast as the UK average at 0.6 per cent last year and higher than any other UK region except East Anglia. Such growth puts pressure on the economy and government-funded training schemes. Yet in the past financial year the province claims to have attracted almost 2,000 jobs through inward investment. This was the development board's second best performance since it began in 1982. 'The most important thing is to get people to come here,' said Mr George Forster, executive director of the board's international investment division. 'If they only go on the media, then they won't want to know Northern Ireland.' At best, Saturday's bombing will prove a temporary discouragement for overseas investors. At worst, it will have stopped the latest peace initiative in its tracks. This will leave the province still struggling to overcome a host of deep-seated structural problems, but without any hope of shedding perhaps the worst image of any region in Europe.

The British Government, in order to divert public attention  from its failure to settle the Northern Ireland issue, does not  refuse to engage in any trick and propaganda artifice in and  outside Britain.    A glance at the past history of clashes in Ireland has  symptoms of the defeat of British policies, both military and  political, in this region and the continuous notoriety earned by  responsible persons in England.    The shooting of any person suspected of terrorist operations  is one sample of these policies. Perhaps the most conspicuous  sample of British policy was the killing of three Irishmen  suspected of membership in IRA in Gibraltar by British security  forces in 1988.    After killing them, the British police found out that the  three Irishmen were not busy laying bombs as suspected but in  fact had no weapons with themselves.    The accident caused the families of the three murdered  persons to file a complaint at European courts against the  British Government for trampling on the second paragraph of the  human rights convention of Europe.    The British Government does not have a good record at the  European courts and since 1950, of the 52 files presented  against Britain, the country has been condemned in 30 cases.    On the other hand in the opinion of many non-aligned  observers the government of Britain has itself been one of the  main causes of political chaos and violent actions in Northern  Ireland. The secret researches performed by the government have  also proved this true.    For example, the daily 'INDEPENDENT' last June disclosed  certain aspects of these secret researches which portrayed the  depth of discrimination against those Catholics of Northern  Ireland who want independence from British colonialism.    On the basis of this report London's political-military  control of Northern Ireland, has over the past 20 years led to  gross inequality and the strengthening of the Protestants who  support prolongation of British rule.    Statistical comparison between the two societies of Northern  Ireland indicate high level of unemployment among Catholics at a  rate that is twice as much as Protestants, in addition to  striking differences in housing, hygiene, and education among  the two groups.    In the opinion of the writers of this report, this is the  direct result of the deliberate policies of London for enacting  discrimination against those who want an end to its presence in  the northern part of Ireland.    On the other hand despite the claims of the British  Government for stopping clashes and armed encounters among the  two groups in Northern Ireland, the statistics of those killed  in these incidents indicate another bitter truth.    Statistics show that for the past seven years until 1993  about 220 Protestants were killed by the republicans. This is  while over the same period 368 republican Catholics were killed  by armed groups who are advocates of English rule.    The British Government while showing itself inclined to  peace  to end the bloody clashes in Ireland has in fact, on many an  occasion entered into coalition with rightist parties that are  opposed to negotiations with the Catholics, and has considered  many concessions for the Protestants in controlling Northern  Ireland.    For instance, British Prime Minister John Major late last  summer, in order to benefit from the support of the extremist  Irish Protestant parties in the parliament and specifically the  Ulster Unionists Workers Party, granted them many privileges  including the establishment of a special selection committee in  parliament.    This issue at that time caused independent observers to  raise  objections and voice concern over the grave results of this  political give-and-take and the probable invalidity of the  present political agreements between England and the Republic of  Ireland in connection with the future of Northern Ireland.    According to observers consider the only probable way for  creating a stable peace in Northern Ireland is for the British  Government to stop its discriminative policies against Catholics  and participate in direct negotiations to be attended by all  sides involved [sentence as received].    London for various reasons has thus far evaded this issue  and  occasionally by bringing up diversions and imaginary claims has  tried to mislead public opinion in and outside the country  especially among the powerful Irish community in the United  States.    Last year, too, an independent committee for investigating  the problem of Northern Ireland named UPSAL had said that any  peace agreement in relation to Northern Ireland without  considering the Catholics and Protestants as equals and with  equal rights for declaring their positions was doomed to fail.

The party's frontbench team published a pamphlet accusing those who supported organisation of tactics 'not dissimilar' to those of the Militant Tendency. The argument came as the Tories - who began organising in Northern Ireland in 1989 - demonstrated the difficulties the mainland parties can experience there. Dr Laurence Kennedy, a Conservative councillor, resigned from North Down Borough Council after attacking his party's policy towards Northern Ireland. Dr Kennedy said Mr John Major, the prime minister, and Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, seemed to want to 'connive in the perpetuation of the religiously divisive politics which have cost Northern Ireland so dearly'. Both events come within days of the understanding reached last week between the Ulster Unionists and the government, which led the nine Ulster Unionist MPs to support Mr Major in the Commons vote on the social chapter. Labour's pamphlet, 'Oranges or lemons?', argued that organising in the province would undermine the party's policy of actively seeking the unity of Ireland through consent. It said that Northern Ireland was different to the rest of the UK because of competing national allegiances. The paper, published by Mr Kevin McNamara, the shadow Northern Ireland secretary, called Labour-supporting electoral integrationists 'dishonest', and accused them of 'entryism' because they really wanted Labour to become a unionist party. Labour MPs who want the party to organise expressed disappointment that Mr McNamara 'should allow such a mischievous and scurrilous document to be published'.

In the latest indication of the concern which the project has aroused in the British textile industry, a delegation of business leaders has said that it will meet Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, on Thursday. The delegation, led by Mr Nicholas Winterton, the Tory MP and chairman of the Manufacturing and Construction Industries Alliance, will urge Sir Patrick to suspend backing for the Pounds 157m Hualon project until the government has canvassed the views of other business leaders. It will also demand that the government should consult British industry about the economic consequences of all future inward investment decisions before they are taken. Mr Christopher Whitehouse, chief executive of the alliance, said: 'We want to ensure that what has happened over Hualon will never happen again. Ministers and civil servants should not feel they have a right to put people out of a job just for political considerations.' The plant - to be built by a Malaysian division of Hualon, of Taiwan - will represent the largest industrial investment in Northern Ireland since the failure of the De Lorean car venture in the 1970s. The project is expected to create about 1,000 jobs in the next 10 years. But leading figures in the British textile industry believe it could lead to the closure of factories amid signs of overcapacity in the European market for fabrics. Earlier this year Sir David Alliance, chairman of Coats Viyella, said that 'as many as 1,000 jobs in Lancashire' could be lost because of the project. Mr Whitehouse said yesterday that he was concerned about the way in which the government took decisions on inward investment in general. His organisation was inviting British companies to inform it of times when government decisions had adversely affected their industry. He said: 'What we want is a change in the Department of Trade and Industry's policies so that the interests of manufacturers are taken into account.'   Companies:-  Hualon Corp.

Before a reception at Hillsborough Castle, the prime minister said: 'We would like the political talks to start again as soon as possible. They made more progress than some people realised.' He said that getting the various constitutional parties back to the table would require 'persuasion and discussion' and that was the way forward. Earlier Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, indicated that the government may take the initiative to restart talks. The last round of discussions between Unionists, the nationalist SDLP and non-sectarian Alliance party broke up without agreement in November. Sir Patrick said yesterday that the time may have come for the British government to propose a plan to enable the talks to be taken forward. Unionists have said there is no prospect of them becoming involved in negotiations again until the Irish government changes its stance on its constitutional claim to Northern Ireland. But last week Mr John Hume, SDLP leader, urged London and Dublin to press ahead with their own plans in the absence of dialogue between the province's parties. Addressing Northern Ireland Conservatives last night, the prime minister said he looked forward to the day when a Conservative Northern Ireland secretary was drawn from a constituency in Ulster. He said he wanted to see elected 'as many people in Northern Ireland as possible supporting Conservative values and policies. 'Northern Ireland is part of the UK, but until recently the people of Northern Ireland had no opportunity to elect representatives of national parties rather than those parties that are purely local in character.

To move products to the main population centres of Europe requires one, and often two, sea crossings. Bad weather can disrupt sailing schedules of the ferry services, and for companies working on 'just-in-time' inventory control, this can signify unexpected and possibly unacceptable delays in delivery times. Nonetheless, this has not prevented more than 1,000 foreign companies establishing manufacturing bases to service the EC market in the Irish Republic and scores more in Northern Ireland over the past 20 years. Leading industrial names in diverse manufacturing sectors such as Coca-Cola, Apple Computers, Motorola, Intel Corporation, Fruit-of-the-Loom, and Microsoft, have all chosen to establish continental-scale production facilities in Ireland. The shopping list of grants and incentives on offer are those that can be expected in most regions throughout Europe seeking to attract mobile inward investment. Capital grants, training, R  D and marketing grants, advance factory facilities, and tax incentives are available in both parts of the island, although these vary considerably from project to project. A standard corporation tax rate of 10 per cent for manufacturing until the year 2010, is an attraction for many companies to the Republic, as is the government's commitment to a stable exchange rate policy and the country's earliest possible inclusion in a single currency area within the EC. Improvements in telecommunications on both sides of the border have facilitated the development of service industries especially in 'back-office' data processing in the public and private sectors. Northern Ireland now claims to have one of the most advanced fibre-optic telecommunications networks anywhere in Europe, with all trunk routes converted to the new technology. Practically any location in the province can have special fibre-optic cable laid to the office or factory door at reasonable cost, signifying that all present and planned technologies, including High Definition TV (HDTV), Integrated Services Data Networks (ISDN) and ultra-high speed data communications will be available through the network. Similar developments are taking place in the Republic, although the fibre-optic network is not yet widespread. On both sides of the border, schools and universities give a high priority to training in information technology, resulting in well-trained workforces with high levels of computer literacy. High-technology and high value-added industries such as electronics and software development have thus been attracted to Ireland, as have the 'back-office' service industries looking for lower-cost locations and lower staff turnovers. Many employers have found that staff loyalty is much greater in Ireland than in large urban centres such as London or New York, and that emigration in search of higher salaries is often not the preferred option for most employees. Indeed, the quality of life is widely considered to be an important location factor for many companies conscious of staff morale. The clean environment and easy access to the countryside and coastline, offers recreational opportunities that are not easily matched in other parts of Europe. The transport infrastructure still shows deficiencies in the Republic in spite of large infusions of cash from Brussels over the past decade. Transport planning has the appearance of being piecemeal and overly influenced by powerful lobby groups at local and national level, leading to the construction of little-used dual carriageways in locations such as Shannon on the west coast, while main trunk routes still wind their way through the high streets of market towns just a few miles outside the capital. A motorway ring route around Dublin is unlikely to be completed before the end of the decade, while planners still appear unable to decide whether to go ahead with building a light-rail transport system for the capital, in spite of predictions of an exponential worsening of traffic congestion in Dublin in the immediate years ahead. Northern Ireland, in contrast, has a well-developed road and rail network, and port facilities which are envied in the Republic to the extent that many road hauliers in the south prefer to use Belfast and Larne rather than Dublin, as their sea route to the UK mainland. Northern Ireland, however, continues to suffer from its 'image problem', as a result of the political violence which this year claimed its 3,000th victim since 1969. Although only very few people and firms are directly affected by the violence, the Industrial Development Board (IDB) recognises it is an uphill task to convince foreign companies to risk their employees or investments in the province. Industrial policy is undergoing a thorough reappraisal on both sides of the border. Economic efficiency is being increasingly stressed in the use of grant-aid for industrial developments as opposed to simple job-creation criteria. The IDB in Northern Ireland spends some Pounds 80-Pounds 100m a year in financial assistance to industry, but this year 'the rise in unemployment in July alone exceeded the combined annual job promotions of the IDB and the Ledu (a small-enterprise promotion body) in 1991-92', according to the autumn economic review of the Northern Ireland Economic Council (Niec). The Niec says that the 46 per cent fall in job promotions over the past year, is largely due to the IDB's new efficiency criteria but notes that the 'implementation of the new strategy was causing a significant degree of confusion both in local industry and within the development agencies themselves as to how the 'backing winners' approach was being implemented'. In the Republic, where IPounds 130m is spent per year in industrial promotion, the government announced last month that in future it is to give greater emphasis to the promotion of Irish indigenous industry. This follows criticisms made in an industrial policy review published earlier this year, that Ireland has become over-dependent on overseas-owned industrial enterprises in developing its industrial base. 'The balance needs to be redressed to achieve greater output and employment growth in the indigenous sector. Existing policies and promotional arrangements have not succeeded in doing this,' said Mr Des O'Malley, the industry and commerce minister. This does not mean that new inward investment will not still be welcomed in Ireland, but it will have to compete more closely with Irish industry for grants and may be subject to tighter performance targets.

The Centre for the Study of Regulated Industries reports today that the average return on historical capital employed in the non-nuclear electricity industry was 23.4 per cent over the period. This compared with 15.2 per cent in telecommunications, 13.6 per cent in gas, 10.9 per cent for airports and 10.6 per cent for water. The report follows last week's agreement by the electricity generators to cap wholesale electricity prices after complaints about rising electricity charges. Since then electricity distributors have started to cut prices in their long-term contracts with industrial users. The report shows that Scottish Power earned the highest return on capital of the privatised utilities with 33.6 per cent, followed by the National Grid Company, which is jointly owned by the electricity distributors, with 28.9 per cent. The report also showed that the state-owned nuclear generators, Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear, have a long way to go before earning private-sector returns. Nuclear Electric's return on capital was 7.4 per cent, and Scottish Nuclear's was 4.7 per cent. A public inquiry has been ordered by Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, into the application by Scottish Power to build a 40-mile line of pylons across Ayrshire as part of the planned interconnector to supply power to Northern Ireland, James Buxton writes. The application is opposed in Ayrshire. It would involve building more than 200 pylons from near Ayr to Ballantrae in south-west Ayrshire, which protestors say is one of the county's most beautiful areas. The interconnector, which is expected to cost Pounds 175m, also involves a cable across the Irish Sea. It will permit the transmission of 250MW of power to Northern Ireland Electricity, which is paying all but Pounds 20m of the scheme's cost. National Power, the electricity generator, was fined Pounds 7,500 and ordered to pay Pounds 13,250 costs for causing an oil spill in the river Thames.

0,FT923-1801 ,"FT923-1801 _AN-CIUDDAEEFT 920921   FT  21 SEP 92 / Survey of Northern Ireland (5): New links forged - North/South Trade      By TIM COONE   SUNBATHERS on Howth Strand in Dublin can look north on a sunny day and clearly see the mountains of South Down 50 miles away. There begins Northern Ireland. If traffic conditions are favourable, it is a mere one-hour drive to the border. If they are not, which is more likely, it can take over three hours to cover the 100 miles to Belfast - the same as the ferry trip to Holyhead across the Irish Sea, and the British market lying beyond. The train journey takes two-and-a-half hours, while an airline service simply does not exist. The underdeveloped transport links between Northern Ireland and the Republic are always a surprise to the newcomer arriving from another European city. No two cities of comparable size and separation elsewhere in northern Europe now lack the high speed road, rail and air links that are vital to successful trade and commerce in the competitive environment of the 1990s. It should be of no surprise therefore, as the EC moves towards the completion of the Single Market, that this geographic anachronism - a result of the 70 years of political distrust and antagonism between the two parts of the island - is finally coming under scrutiny, as is the entire subject of north-south trade. The Confederation of Irish Industry (CII) calculates that manufacturers in the south sell only one-third as much per capita in Northern Ireland as they do in their home territory in spite of the proximity of the market. Manufacturers in the north, meanwhile, sell only one-sixth as much per capita in the south as they do in Northern Ireland. Only 5 per cent of the south's total exports go to the north, while the north supplies only 4 per cent of the south's imports. The possibilities for enhanced trade would seem to be considerable. According to the CII, a total of 75,000 additional jobs on both sides of the border could be achieved by exploiting more fully the market potential within the island of Ireland. It is a theme to which politicians north and south are increasingly warming. In May, amid much fanfare, Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, launched a 200-page government study on cross-border economic co-operation. The central message of the study is this: 'In an increasingly integrated Europe, the costs of the current one-island/two-economy basis of operation will have an inhibiting effect on economic progress.' In a keynote speech in July, Mr Robert Atkins, Northern Ireland's minister for the economy and environment, echoed Mr Reynolds' views. He pointed to growing links between business federations on both sides of the border and the challenge of the European Single Market. Such developments, he said, 'add up to a fundamental change in circumstances and open up the real prospect of a quantum change in the economic relationships between Northern Ireland and the Republic'. Both governments have made commitments to upgrade the road and rail links between Belfast and Dublin. Infrastructure will not be sufficient in itself, however. The fact that around 20 per cent of the Republic's foreign trade is already transported across the border for onward consignment by road to Britain and Europe, suggests that infrastructure is not necessarily a limiting factor to improved north-south trade. Some are also highly sceptical of the CII's estimate of 75,000 additional jobs coming from improved trade. Dr Graham Gudgin, the director of the Northern Ireland Economic and Social Research Centre (NIESRC), says that a recent survey based on 870 Northern Ireland manufacturing companies, accounting for 80 per cent of manufacturing employment in Northern Ireland, found that two-thirds of these firms are already involved in some trade with the Republic, and that Northern Ireland firms already export three times more on a per capita basis to the Republic than they do to mainland UK. 'I am sceptical of large short-term gains but I support the efforts to improve trade,' said Dr Gudgin. 'We certainly should increase trade to increase long-term competitiveness but we should not create over-optimistic expectations. Greater trade and access to each other's market means job losses as well as gains.' Of immediate benefit, however, will be the plan by the two governments to establish a joint tender information system, whereby firms on either side of the border will be invited to tender for contracts of both governments. The creation of a new database detailing all the manufacturing firms in the island of Ireland, their products and capabilities, will be made available to the public, possibly next year. Joint trade fairs and roadshows are also planned. Such initiatives will never, independently of the EC process of integration, result in Northern Ireland's economy becoming as integrated with the Republic as it is with the rest of the UK. Wage bargaining systems are different, and the fiscal structures and public expenditure programmes remain independent of each other. But that is not the primary goal. In the words of Mr Atkins, 'the benefits of increased cross-border trade will go beyond the purely economic. The more contact people in both parts of Ireland have with each other, and the more they see their interests bound up together, the more likely it is that understanding and tolerance will grow'.  -------------------------------------------------------------------                   CROSS-BORDER TRADE COMPARISONS  ------------------------------------------------------------------- 1989                                             Pounds m  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Imports to the Republic of Ireland from Great Britain                                  4,538 from Northern Ireland                                 489  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Exports by the Republic of Ireland To Great Britain                                    4,120 To Northern Ireland                                   776  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Central Statistics Office, Dublin  -------------------------------------------------------------------  The Financial Times   London Page 14  "
0,FT932-5128 ,"FT932-5128 _AN-DFFAXABLFT 930605   FT  05 JUN 93 / Unlikely alliances bring aviation success: Paul Betts on the success of Shorts under Catholic ownership in a Protestant bunker      By PAUL BETTS   IN THE industrial sprawl of east Belfast's docklands, the world's oldest mass producer of aircraft faces a double test. Short Brothers is trying to rejuvenate a business that was all but given up for dead four years ago. Its new Roman Catholic ownership, operating out of a traditional Protestant bunker, is striving to encourage harmony and co-operation in a split community. Since its privatisation in 1989 and its sale to the French-Canadian Bombardier transport equipment group, Shorts, Northern Ireland's largest employer outside the public sector, has become the largest private-sector employer of Roman Catholics in Belfast. Mr Roy McNulty, president of Shorts, says the proportion of Catholics employed by the company has risen to about 13 per cent from only 5 per cent a few years ago. The unlikely alliance between Bombardier, which is relatively new to the aerospace industry, and one of the most historic names of aviation, rooted in Protestant Belfast, has produced one of the few recent success stories in the aerospace industry. 'Four years ago we had no money, no modern equipment,' says Mr McNulty. 'We were doomed.' Since privatisation, sales have doubled. From a loss of Pounds 46.9m in 1988, Shorts made Pounds 26.5m in 1991 and Pounds 28.5m in 1992. Mr McNulty predicts a 'another good solid profit' this year. As part of its recovery strategy, Shorts has worked to develop harmonious working relations inside its plants in order to remove religious animosity from the factory floor. Encouraged by Bombardier, the company has invested in internal training, in education programmes for Protestant and Roman Catholic schools throughout Northern Ireland - including programmes on aerospace and other advanced technologies for primary schools - and the endowment of a new university chair of aeronautical engineering. Mr McNulty says the company is spending 2 per cent to 3 per cent of its annual Pounds 392m turnover on training. While maintaining tight control on costs and overall strategy, the French-Canadian conglomerate has traditionally left subsidiaries to manage their own affairs. 'They don't buy companies to change them but let the management in place get on with it,' says Mr McNulty. He says Bombardier has adopted a sympathetic approach to the problems of manufacturing in Northern Ireland. 'They are as confused as most people about the political situation here, but they also have tensions in Quebec that are not so different.' The fact that Bombardier was prepared to take over and maintain Shorts as a corporate entity was one of the main reasons why the government agreed to sell it to the French Canadians. An alternative joint bid by the UK General Electric Company and Fokker, the Dutch aircraft manufacturer, was rejected because of fears that Shorts might be split. 'The crucial thing to remember,' said a UK aerospace industry analyst, 'is that should anything happen to Shorts, it would have a huge economic and political impact on Northern Ireland. Shorts has been a pillar of stability for the Northern Ireland economy, and if the pillar started crumbling it would have shattering repercussions.' Although Shorts has not escaped the recession, its workforce has increased by nearly 10 per cent during the past four years from 7,700 at the end of 1988 to around 8,300 today after reaching a peak of 8,982 last year. This has been at a time when the UK aerospace industry as a whole has suffered a 25 per cent decline in employment. 'Privatisation was the essential catalyst for the transformation of Shorts,' says Mr McNulty, admitting it was an expensive exercise, costing the government about Pounds 800m to write off debts and recapitalise the company before selling it for Pounds 30m. 'For a decade our government owners put nothing in the business,' Mr McNulty says. 'Capital investment per employee was the lowest in the industry; we were getting an average of Pounds 3m a year from the government, which had to approve any investment over Pounds 100,000; our plants were still operating with second world war machines and technology.' Bombardier's strategy was 'to fix what we've got' rather than start afresh. 'We've been living in a continuous building site since privatisation, upgrading and investing in new machinery,' says Mr Ken Brundle, head of Shorts' aircraft division. In the past, the company had to sub-contract much high-value-added machining and other work outside Northern Ireland because of lack of adequate equipment. Investment has enabled it to reverse that process. 'We used to have as many as 110 machinery sub-contractors all over the world: we now have only 12 of which eight are in Northern Ireland employing a total of about 4,000 people,' says Mr Brundle. Improved motivation and work practices as well as new equipment have brought a big boost to productivity. In 1989 it took Shorts 40,000 man-hours to complete a wing set for the Fokker 100 regional jet. Last year, according to Mr Brundle, it took just under 17,000 man-hours to complete the same wing set. Next week, Shorts is expected to try to capitalise on its new relations with the French-Canadian company at the world's biggest air show in Paris and win new business. In so doing, it hopes to continue restoring Northern Ireland's reputation as a centre of aerospace manufacturing activity.   Companies:-  Short Brothers.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

He also hinted that the government could be close to proposing the establishment of a Northern Ireland select committee. Such a move would be seen as reinforcing the government's commitment to the province's Unionist majority. In his second Commons appearance this week Sir Patrick was asked by Mr Kevin McNamara, shadow Northern Ireland secretary: 'Do you acknowledge the value of the goal of a united Ireland?' The question was similar to one in a leaked draft Dublin position paper which is privately acknowledged to be among the principal sticking-points over an agreed framework for a settlement. Sir Patrick's reply - that the government could not 'join the ranks of the persuaders' - underlined London's unwillingness to back down on the issue. He said: 'We believe that it should be for the people of Northern Ireland to determine for themselves without persuasion from us whether they wish to remain in the UK or no.' Sir Patrick offered encouragement to supporters of a Northern Ireland select committee. In a carefully worded answer to Mr John Hume, Social Democratic and Labour party leader, Sir Patrick said: 'It might be said that there is some value in having a select committee looking at the affairs of Northern Ireland, rather than having six separate select committees taking part of Northern Ireland's affairs into their ambit. 'There has been much said here about the need to reduce the democratic deficit in Northern Ireland.' But Sir Patrick disagreed with an assertion by Mr James Molyneaux, the Ulster Unionist party leader, that restoring accountable democracy to Northern Ireland was 'a necessary first step' to restoring stability 'and subsequently peace'. He acknowledged that there was 'a good measure of agreement' on the need for new political institutions in the province. Mr Major later spoke of an 'overwhelming feeling' that the government should strive for peace in Northern Ireland, but added: 'There are parameters to those discussions - and that must be understood.'

He is absolutely right to point out that the dispute in Northern Ireland is about nationality but wrong to see this as a choice between being British and being Irish. The people of Northern Ireland, in both communities, have never shown any desire to be British, as can be demonstrated by their consistent failure to elect British mainstream party MPs to Westminster; all of the electorate have repeatedly voted for local fringe candidates and every sitting Ulster MP is a fringe politician. Mr Powell should reflect that the choice facing the people of Northern Ireland is between being Irish and being Northern Irish. The majority may well choose to be Northern Irish, but they should understand the full implications of that. He, like every unionist politician this century, does the people of Ulster a grave disservice by continuing to speak of Northern Ireland as part of the UK when that relationship has never existed outside legal fiction. He should also reflect that, were the people of Britain to be asked, by referendum, whether they wished Northern Ireland to be part of Britain, they would overwhelmingly vote against this. The 'loyalist' and 'unionist' community must eventually face this reality. They must decide whether they can go it alone as an independent state within the European Union or join the rest of the population of the island of Ireland in forging one secular state. But they have so consistently opposed the British option that this can no longer be a real possibility for them.

In a veiled warning to the government he said Ireland's traditional cycle of one paramilitary force replacing another could recur if there was no progress towards peace. He told the Boston Herald newspaper during his US visit: 'None of us can say two or three years up the road that if the causes of conflict aren't resolved, that another IRA leadership won't come along. Because this has always happened. The history of Ireland is filled with phases of armed struggle and then of quiet.' Mr Adams, who is on a tour of the US, tempered his warning with a reaffirmation of his hope there would be a lasting peace. 'I want to see the gun taken permanently out of British politics. I mean that is our intention. Who's interested in temporary? We live there.' Mr Michael Mates, the former Northern Ireland minister sent by the government to shadow Mr Adams's tour, said the Sinn Fein leader's remarks about a permanent peace 'take us a little further. I happen to believe that the intention is that the end should be permanent, but he cannot say it'. The government has promised to start preliminary talks on how to admit Sinn Fein to the political process within three months of a permanent end to IRA violence. David Owen writes: Conservatives from Northern Ireland are moving to rock the boat before next month's Tory conference by urging the party 'actively to persuade' the people of the province that their best future lies within the UK. They are trying to force a vote on this by canvassing support among Tory constituency organisations. Their amendment to the motion on Northern Ireland that will be debated at the conference also calls for the deletion of a reference to the courage of Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister. A letter to constituency chairmen from Mr Leonard Fee, the senior unpaid Tory in the province, argues that it would be 'distasteful to ask the party conference to praise Mr Reynolds'. Tory party rules vest the 'absolute right' to decide whether to call amendments with the conference chairman, making it unlikely the Northern Ireland amendment will be voted on. However Mr Fee, chairman of the Tories' Northern Ireland Area Council, believes the party's high command could be embarrassed if a significant number of constituencies write in to express their support. He points out that although most motions submitted on Northern Ireland are concerned with 'strengthening the union and governing Northern Ireland as the rest of the United Kingdom,' these sentiments are not reflected in the motion selected for debate.

He cheered Unionist MPs by saying Conservatives stood 'four square' behind the union with Britain. But the prime minster's comments infuriated nationalist MPs and could set back still further the chances of round-table talks on Northern Ireland resuming this year. Mr John Hume, leader of the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party, said Mr Major was 'playing politics' while lives were being lost. Last night Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, wrote to Mr John Smith, Labour leader, asking for clarification of Labour's Ulster policy. Earlier Sir Patrick said uncertainty about Northern Ireland's constitutional status 'must make the task of the security forces harder.' The government has in the past tried to act as a neutral 'facilitator' in negotiations and has enjoyed backing from Labour for its efforts. It has said Northern Ireland will remain part of the UK as long as a majority of the population want that.

Sir Patrick told the Commons he was keen to assist in reopening a political dialogue and build on the advances made in talks over the last two years. But he acknowledged: 'Regrettably a lot more progress must yet be made before direct rule will no longer be needed in the interests of all the people of Northern Ireland.' There were issues that required 'further, private consideration' between the British government, the Irish government and Northern Ireland parties. Sir Patrick was introducing the Northern Ireland Act (Interim Period Extension) Order, which extends direct rule for another year. Mr Kevin McNamara, the shadow Northern Ireland secretary, said he was moving away from a 'neutral agenda' towards an internal settlement. He said: 'It's now time for both the British and Irish governments to reinvigorate and deepen their co-operation within the Anglo-Irish Agreement. The two governments should seek to make whatever progress is possible and seek ways to share responsibility and ensure the needs of the people of Northern Ireland are met. 'If the parties themselves are not able to meet together and talk together . . there is increasing responsibility on both governments to sit down and resolve their differences.'

It suspects information it received from UK authorities was inaccurate. Mr Karel Van Miert, the competition commissioner, will write to the UK Department of Trade and Industry, asking it to clarify evidence given by the government about the project and its likely impact on the European textiles market. Commission officials said if the department failed to provide satisfactory answers, the case would be reopened. That might lead to Brussels prohibiting the grant and ordering the government to recover any money paid to Hualon. The Commission approved the subsidy to Hualon, one of Taiwan's biggest industrial groups, in May, after intense lobbying by UK ministers. They were supported by Mr Jacques Delors, outgoing president of the European Commission, in the interests of underpinning the Northern Ireland peace process. Brussels accepted the UK government's arguments that the plant would not disrupt the European textiles market, in that it would supply synthetic fibre to low-cost clothing manufacturers in Europe, and that its output would substitute for imports from outside the European Union. However, Mr Van Miert is now seeking further assurances that the plant will not add to excess capacity in the European textiles industry by producing high-quality products that will undercut existing manufacturers and create unemployment. 'At the time (of the approval) we were convinced that production was at the lower end of the market,' said a senior commission official yesterday. 'But some doubt has come up and now we want reassurances. If not, we will have to look into the files.' Last week, European textiles and clothing manufacturers challenged the Commission's decision in the European Court. They argue that the Pounds 157m plant will threaten jobs in an already over-supplied sector. Britain has long prided itself on a rigorous application of EU competition rules and regularly complains when state aids in steel and the airline industry are handed out in other member states. The timing of Mr Van Miert's re-examination is doubly sensitive, as the UK government is expected to win at least Pounds 250m in special EU aid to Northern Ireland at this week's European Council in Essen.

Labour and the Scottish Nationalist party seized on the decision to demand that the controversial plan for the privatisation of Scottish water also be postponed - a call rebuffed by Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary. Northern Ireland water privatisation was promised in the government's election manifesto. But Mr Michael Mates, Northern Ireland minister, told MPs late on Tuesday that for 'technical reasons' the sell-off had to be postponed. Ministers said yesterday that a report by consultants Touche Ross had concluded that the time needed for reforming water charges and to collate data on consumer and environmental issues ruled out privatisation before the next election. The NIO favours privatisation via flotation rather than a trade sale. Ministers insisted that the commitment to privatisation remained. The delay will help Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, restart political talks on province's future following local elections on May 19. Unionist and nationalist parties are opposed to water privatisation and welcomed the move. 'We hope it will be the harbinger of things to come,' said one Ulster Unionist MP who believed the delay was intended to help win his party's support for political talks. In the past year the government has looked to Unionist MPs to help avert Commons defeats on coal and, to a lesser extent, on Maastricht. The decision will not have been hard for Northern Ireland ministers who are not among the most enthusiastic supporters of privatisation. Reform of water charges is expected to lead to controversy, with many of the less well-off households affected being in nationalist communities. Scottish water privatisation has been linked by the government to restructuring of Scottish local authorities. Mr Lang said: 'The circumstances in Scotland are different from those in Northern Ireland.

Relaxing opposition to a committee could help win the votes of nine Ulster Unionist and three Democratic Unionist party MPs - and head off a defeat on Labour's amendment on Maastricht's social chapter. The chances of a government defeat, which could wreck the bill, heightened this week as Euro-sceptic Tories and Liberal Democrat MPs indicated they would back Labour. Sir Peter Emery, chairman of the Commons procedure committee, is seeking views on whether a committee on Northern Ireland, with powers to launch investigations, should be established. All other main Whitehall departments have a corresponding select committee. Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, has argued that a committee should only be part of a wider settlement between Unionists and nationalists. But he has stressed to colleagues that, technically, any decision on setting one up is a matter for MPs, not the government. In practice, however, the government's view would be decisive. One Northern Ireland Office insider said Unionists had a list of demands that would increase their say on the province's affairs. 'Things crop up from time to time which may make it necessary to accede to one,' he said. No offer would be made by the government until nearer the vote, at least four weeks away, and then only if the government was convinced it would otherwise lose. But it is far from clear whether a select committee would convert enough Unionists, who are strongly opposed to Maastricht. Mr James Molyneaux and the Rev Ian Paisley, the two Unionist leaders, may refuse to offer support at any price. Ministers accept that there is no logical reason why the Northern Ireland Office should not be made accountable to parliament such as other Whitehall departments, including the Scottish and Welsh offices - possibly as a justification for relenting to Unionist demands. Agreeing to a select committee, however, would undermine government policy on Northern Ireland by angering the Irish government and nationalists in the province. It could lead to further delay to resumption of 'round-table' talks on Northern Ireland. Separately, the Northern Ireland Office is preparing to come under attack from Unionist MPs when the government publishes its white paper on the future of the union between Scotland and the rest of the UK. That document is expected to be strongly pro-union and opposed to devolution  -almost the opposite of government policy on Northern Ireland. Sir Patrick wants a devolved government in Northern Ireland and says it will remain part of the UK only as long as a majority of its population so wishes.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland Secretary, has  indicated  he will publish proposals within the next fortnight to devolve  power to the province and set up cross-border policy bodies.    But Mr Peter Robinson, deputy leader of the Democratic  Unionists, said any new arrangements based on the principles of  the Downing Street declaration on Northern Ireland were  unacceptable.    In the Commons, Mr Major said progress on a political  settlement would not wait upon Sinn Fein which has yet to  respond to the invitation to join talks.    He confirmed that ideas designed to give ""focus and  direction"" to the talks process would be brought forward soon,  despite signs of a rift with Dublin over the timing of the  initiative.    Mr Major took his first public opportunity to denounce the  propaganda campaign waged by Mr Adams on his trip to America.    ""I don't believe people in Britain or in Ireland have been  deceived by Adams's performance,"" he said. The way to peace in  Northern Ireland was ""in Gerry Adams's hands and I believe he  could and should do it,"" Mr Majo added .    On his return to Dublin, Mr Adams again declined the  opportunity to announce a permanent cessation of violence.  However, he said ""we are now in the final phase of this  conflict"" -- a message which observers took to be directed at  the IRA rather than the Government.    Following Mr Adams's visit to New York, the Government has  decided to try to wrest the initiative from Sinn Fein. But the  initial response from the Democratic Unionists was hostile, if  predictable.    Mr Robinson said on BBC radio: ""The whole constitutional  position of Northern Ireland has been transformed.    ""The self-determination of the people of Northern Ireland  has  been handed away from it being vested entirely with the people  of Northern Ireland to the whole of the people of the island of  Ireland.""    The DUP [Democratic Unionist Party] response demonstrates  how  difficult it will be to make any progress in the foreseeable  future and there were indications that Dublin is not convinced  that the time is right for Sir Patrick to table his proposals.    Mr Dick Spring, Ireland's Foreign Minister, said he trusted  that the initiative would be directed towards the achievement of  the objectives the governments had jointly set themselves.    Mr Seamus Mallon, deputy leader of the nationalist SDLP  [Social Democratic Labour Party], maintained it was clear from  what Mr Adams had said in America that Sinn Fein ""does not  accept the principle of self-determination based on consent.""

Ministers have insisted for weeks they are not waiting for  an  IRA/Sinn Fein response but are pushing ahead with efforts to  find agreement between political parties on a predominantly  internal settlement.    In an interview in today's BELFAST TELEGRAPH, however,  Michael Ancram, the Northern Ireland minister responsible for  developing the suspended inter-party talks, concedes that peace  and a political settlement are ""inextricably linked.""    ""The declaration and the talks are part and parcel of the  same process,"" he said. ""I don't believe you can have peace  without a widely acceptable political settlement and I think you  probably can't have a widely acceptable political settlement  without peace."" His comments imply that without the IRA  renouncing violence, the prospect of inter-party talks reaching  agreement are slim.    Mr Ancram's comments come on the eve of the meeting between  the Irish Taoiseach, Albert Reynolds, and John Major at Downing  Street to review progress of the inter-party talks as well as  Sinn Fein's response to the joint declaration signed by both  governments before Christmas.    Yesterday, the Northern Ireland Secretary, Sir Patrick  Mayhew, said that he was hoping to see new institutions of joint  co-operation between the North and south of Ireland set up as  part of his package designed to bring agreement between Dublin,  London and the four constitutional parties in Northern Ireland.    He welcomed ""any step that is intended to develop  co-operation on economic and other matters."" He thought that  the new institutions ""could be undertaken...without impinging on  the sovereignty of Northern Ireland.""    Sir Patrick, speaking in the Commons, was pressed by his  shadow, Kevin McNamara, on whether new North-South bodies  dealing with issues like as the economy or infrastructure should  have an executive role, based on ground rules laid down by both  governments.    Sir Patrick argued that ""any organisation, call it a board  or  a structure, should have clear objectives, with clearly defined  lines of authority, coming from wherever it is appropriate,  whether it is Westminster, Dublin, or any subsequently  established legislative body.""    The British Government sent secret outline proposals to  Dublin this month on the extension of co-operation between the  two parts of Ireland.    The Ulster Unionists would like the bodies to be almost  exclusively consultative, but are willing to see the British  representatives drawn from a Northern Ireland assembly.    James Molyneaux, the Unionists' leader, indicated that  representives of a proposed Ulster assembly could talk to the  South, as long as ""the sovereignty of Northern Ireland remained  undiminished.""

The allegations, published in today's Guardian newspaper, concern Mr Neil Hamilton, the trade and industry minister, and Mr Tim Smith, the Northern Ireland minister. Mr Stuart Bell, a Labour trade and industry spokesman, said in the Commons that, according to the report, a leading parliamentary lobbyist was paid thousands of pounds for parliamentary questions to be tabled by the two men at Pounds 2,000 a time. The questions were about the takeover of Harrods, the London department store, and were reported to have been tabled in the late 1980s at the height of the battle between Lonrho and the House of Fraser. Mr Hamilton and Mr Smith were backbench MPs at the time. Mr Bell added: 'They were both named in the article as recipients of payments passed to Ian Greer Associates by Mohammed al-Fayed, the owner of Harrods, on top of Pounds 50,000 on a parliamentary lobbying campaign.' He called for an urgent statement from the prime minister on the report. Mr Hamilton could not be reached for comment last night. The Northern Ireland Office said Mr Smith had no comment. A Downing Street spokesman declined to make any immediate comment on the accusations. The report came as a parliamentary inquiry into allegations that Tory MPs Mr Graham Riddick and Mr David Tredinnick accepted payment for tabling parliamentary questions was thrown into chaos after seven Labour MPs withdrew because it is not to be be held in public. Meanwhile, another powerful committee of MPs decided not to investigate allegations that Mr Mark Thatcher, the son of the former prime minister, received Pounds 12m in commission from an arms deal negotiated by the British government in the 1980s.

His remarks came the day after a fresh meeting between Ulster's main party leaders and Mr Peter Brooke, the Northern Ireland secretary. Mr Peter Bottomley (C Eltham), a former Northern Ireland minister, urged Mr Major to 'send a message to the Provisional IRA and the 'disloyalists' that the mindless, aimless use of bullets and bombs will not be as successful as parliamentary debates and normal political campaigning'. Mr Major replied: 'The whole House will share your view on that latter matter. 'I warmly welcome the decision of the Northern Ireland political leaders to start their talks again.

British government policy for the last two decades has been to help society in Northern Ireland to develop and, 'enable it once again to become self governing, to the extent at least that it was when Stormont had jurisdiction. That is our objective,' Sir Patrick said in an interview with the Financial Times. The government is committed to finding agreement with the main constitutional parties in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland on new forms of government for the province. But Sir Patrick's comments give the clearest insight yet into his own thinking since he took over the job three months ago. They contrast with the support of some unionists and Conservative MPs for an 'integrationist' policy, in which Northern Ireland would by ruled much like other parts of the UK. Unionist and nationalist politicians are due to begin talks on Monday with the Irish and UK governments on 'strand two' of the nine-week-old inter-party talks process. This is the point at which the Irish government enters negotiations to talk about relations between north and south Ireland. Before the imposition of 'direct rule' of Northern Ireland from Westminster in the early 1970s, Stormont had responsibility for most policy areas, including, critically, internal security. Westminster retained control of national defence, foreign affairs, major taxation items, and customs and excise. Sir Patrick has also indicated that he would not oppose a bill of rights for Northern Ireland - a proposal backed by all the main constitutional parties in the province during the talks process. There is, however, a dispute between unionists and nationalists about what such a bill of rights might contain. Sir Patrick said he opposed incorporating the European convention on human rights into English and Welsh law but added: 'It doesn't flow from that that I would necessarily oppose a bill of rights for Northern Ireland.'

The deal will make AIB the third largest banking group in Northern Ireland, after the Northern Bank and the Ulster Bank. At present it has 45 branches in Northern Ireland. The two banks have an estimated combined share of about 25 per cent. Mr Peter Sutherland, AIB chairman, said the TSB acquisition was an important ingredient in AIB's strategy of increasing its strength in its core market. 'It is one of the biggest ever private sector investments in Northern Ireland and is a vote of confidence in its economy,' he said. TSB said yesterday that it had been approached by AIB about the sale. 'It is good for TSB Group shareholders, whose investment in TSB Bank Northern Ireland is being sold for a price well in excess of book value,' said Sir Nicholas Goodison, TSB chairman. AIB has paid Pounds 42.5m in goodwill, above the Pounds 68.5m book value of the operations, which last year made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 17.7m, including a pensions holiday benefit of Pounds 1.25m, on total assets of Pounds 697.2m. It has given an undertaking that there will be no compulsory redundancies in Northern Ireland among the 1,400 employees of the two banks as a result of the TSB takeover. Mr John Taylor, an Ulster Unionist party MP, said yesterday that AIB still did not employ people on a basis which reflected the religious composition of Northern Ireland and called on the bank not to discriminate against Protestant employees in any rationalisation. In the past there have been allegations that both banks contravened fair employment rules in Northern Ireland with AIB alleged to employ a disproportionate number of Roman Catholics while TSB allegedly leaned towards Protestant employees. Mr Gerry Scanlan, AIB chief executive, said that there would 'definitely not be a rights issue' to fund the TSB purchase. Last year AIB made an IPounds 160m (Pounds 145m) rights issue to finance a Dollars 217m (Pounds 125.8m) bid for Baltimore Bancorp in the US. However, the bid was eventually abandoned because of the parlous state of the US banking sector. TSB Group has struggled to contain losses on bad debts by Hill Samuel, its merchant banking subsidiary. In March, Sir Nicholas told shareholders that the bank faced a sharp cut in interim profits this year because of continuing losses on corporate lending by Hill Samuel.

The government said yesterday that the National Heritage Department had decided to continue with the ban, which came into force in October 1988. Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, is the only legal political organisation affected by the ban. Whitehall officials said the Northern Ireland Office had questioned the effectiveness of a ban which allows actors to speak the words of Sinn Fein representatives over pictures of them speaking. Lifting the restriction would have caused an outcry from Ulster unionists and rightwing Conservatives. TheThatcherite Conservative Way Forward yesterday launched its policy for Ulster calling for preventive detention north and south of the border with an appeal system. The group said: 'The worst thing now would be for policy in Northern Ireland to drift on aimlessly in the forlorn hope that the terrorists will change their minds.' Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, renewed his appeal to Sinn Fein to join the other political parties in talks which could involve a significant transfer of power to Northern Ireland. Sir Patrick repeated the British view that the UK-Irish joint declaration, which was intended to stand the test of time, could not be renegotiated as, he said, was now the intention of Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein leader. He said: 'That was the message we sent to them last year. It is repeated unequivocally in the joint declaration. The governments have set out where they stand.

In a speech clearly aimed at Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, and Northern Ireland's unionists, he told an audience at Trinity College in Dublin yesterday evening, that there will be no 'short cuts' to an agreement for new constitutional arrangements in Northern Ireland and that there will be no backtracking on the Downing Street declaration. In what appeared to be an indirect response to Sinn Fein's concerns, expressed at its annual conference last weekend, that the declaration gives unionists a means to block the pathway to any political progress, Sir Patrick said: 'No one will be allowed to erect impassable procedural barriers to progress. The path of peaceful persuasion is open to all, on the basis of their democratic mandates. 'But those who choose to stay in their cul-de-sacs can have no veto over progress.' The Sinn Fein leader, Mr Martin McGuinness, told the FT last weekend, that if the British government were to clarify that unionists do not have such a veto, then this could break the current stalemate and lead to an IRA ceasefire. Sir Patrick emphasised that any change to Northern Ireland's constitutional status, can only come about with the consent of the majority living there, and not as a result of the majority wish in the island of Ireland as a whole. He said that an 'overwhelming majority' of people on the island supported this view, as evidenced by recent opinion polls. But there remained no predetermined outcome to any future talks and nothing would be ruled in or out. 'If Northern Ireland is to cease to be part of the UK (or) if there is to be a united Ireland, then that is a question which can only be determined by all the people living in Ireland, North and South,' he said. Agreement and consent of a majority in Northern Ireland would be necessary for any change, as stated in the joint declaration, Sir Patrick added. 'It is self-determination, in other words democracy, that shall prevail . . . no one should claim a veto to override that,' he said.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Sir Patrick told the Commons he was keen to assist in reopening a political dialogue and build on the advances made in talks over the last two years. But he acknowledged: 'Regrettably a lot more progress must yet be made before direct rule will no longer be needed in the interests of all the people of Northern Ireland.' There were issues that required 'further, private consideration' between the UK Government, the Irish government and Northern Ireland parties. Sir Patrick was introducing the Northern Ireland Act (Interim Period Extension) Order, which extends direct rule for another year. Mr Kevin McNamara, the shadow Northern Ireland secretary, said he was moving away from a 'neutral agenda' towards an internal settlement. He said: 'It's now time for both the British and Irish governments to reinvigorate and deepen their co-operation within the Anglo-Irish Agreement. 'The two governments should seek to make whatever progress is possible and seek ways to share responsibility and ensure the needs of the people of Northern Ireland are met. 'If the parties themselves are not able to meet together and talk together . . there is increasing responsibility on both governments to sit down and resolve their differences.' Earlier, Sir Patrick underlined the Government's resolve to defeat terrorists who, he said, remained a serious threat in the province. There were 75 murders by terrorists in Northern Ireland last year and 33 so far this year. He said he found 'inspiring the staunchness and resilience' of those who met 'their cruel attacks' and added: 'Our own commitment is no less implacable.' Last year 405 people were charged with terrorist-related offences - including 101 with murder and attempted murder. By June this year, 158 people had been charged, he said.

The votes of the nine Ulster Unionist MPs and three Democratic Unionist MPs could be crucial to win Commons approval for the proposals to be set out by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary. The two unionist parties made clear yesterday that they are anxious to help Northern Ireland's electricity users. MPs from the parties have already met Mr Tim Eggar, the energy minister. 'We will be looking at the impact of the government's energy review on the whole of the UK,' said one Ulster Unionist MP. Northern Ireland MPs complain that large electricity users in the province face charges up to 25 per cent higher than on the mainland. When MPs voted on the proposed pit closures in October, the DUP voted with Labour and the Ulster Unionist abstained - but only after a government assurance that its energy review would include Northern Ireland. The MPs could demand financial support for the proposed electricity inter-connector with Scotland, although the government is already backing an application for a European Community subsidy for the project. Unionists also want to boost the local lignite industry, perhaps by being awarded contracts for electricity generation.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Ireland electricity share sale: Last non-nuclear power company to be privatised in June      By MICHAEL SMITH   THE government is to privatise Northern Ireland Electricity in June amid City expectations that it will seek to raise between Pounds 300m and Pounds 400m in the flotation. Following this sale of the last non-nuclear power company in the public sector, the next step in the government's privatisation programme is expected to be the disposal of its remaining shares in British Telecom. Yesterday's NIE announcement reinforced City speculation that the BT sale will be in late July. The government yesterday launched the privatisation of NIE, the first flotation to be targeted specifically at the Northern Ireland public, with a series of television advertisements featuring Finn McCool, the legendary Irish giant. The offer for sale will be in early June, with share trading expected to start in the week beginning June 21. Potential investors will have to wait until mid-May before the company publishes its pathfinder prospectus, including accounts for the year just ended and profit forecasts. The share price will be announced in early June. Mr Simon Linnett, a director of N. M. Rothschild, advising the government, said yesterday he could not yet say how much the government would realise. But he expected the order of magnitude to be 'about the same' as the Pounds 350m realised last year through the sale of the four Northern Ireland generating plants. The disposal of NIE, which procures, supplies and transmits electricity throughout Northern Ireland, represents the penultimate stage in the government's privatisation of non-nuclear electricity companies. The final stage is likely next March when the government is expected to sell its remaining 40 per cent stakes in National Power and PowerGen. Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, said yesterday that one of the government's objectives was to widen and deepen share ownership in Northern Ireland. At least half of the shares will be available to small investors who, like institutional investors, will be asked to pay for the shares in instalments over about a year. About 570,000 customers in Northern Ireland will be mailed directly about the flotation along with another 750,000 potential investors in Great Britain. UK institutions will be given presentations in April and May. The initial allocation to them will be reduced if there is substantial demand from small shareholders. NIE customers will be eligible for incentives including bonus shares and bill-discounts if they register with the NIE share information office. Non-customers who register will be eligible for bonus shares, although on less favourable terms. Four banks - AIB, First Trust Bank, Northern Bank and Ulster Bank - have been appointed to operate share shops. Investors will also be encouraged by Finn McCool who, according to Irish folklore, bestrode the Giant's Causeway around 250BC. In one of two television commercials, McCool is shown emerging amid lightning and crashing boulders from a cliff-face. Investors in the rest of the UK will have to be content with newspaper advertisement images of McCool, as television advertisements are not being shown outside Northern Ireland.

Only a handful of MPs from mainland constituencies expressed reservations about the declaration, and Mr John Major, the prime minister, was given strong support by key backbenchers on both sides. Conservative MPs cheered as Mr Major challenged Sinn Fein, the political arm of the IRA, to accept the challenge to condemn violence and join the political process. Reaction from the Conservative back benches was largely positive, although a handful of MPs suggested that the agreement represented a weakening of Britain's commitment to Northern Ireland. Others called for assurances that the fight against terrorism would continue, and urged the government to insist on a surrender of weapons and explosives by the IRA before entering into talks with Sinn Fein. In Belfast last night Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, signalled on a television discussion programme that the IRA might be required to surrender its arsenal of weapons before being accepted into the political process. Mr Andrew Hunter, the influential chairman of the Conservative backbench Northern Ireland committee, said the declaration was 'a positive step forward'. But there were cheers as he urged the prime minister to 'ensure that there is no let-up in the hunt for those who perpetrate violence'. Mr Peter Temple-Morris, a senior Conservative backbencher, said the declaration was supported by the UK-Irish Inter Parliamentary Body, of which he is joint chairman. Mr Tom King, a former Northern Ireland secretary, said the declaration contained nothing to seriously threaten the interests of any part of the Northern Ireland community. Few MPs expressed concern about the permanence of the links between Northern Ireland and the UK. However, Mr Tony Marlow, the Conservative MP for Northampton North, said there was 'a danger that people will say that the prime minister of the UK is careless with regard to the integrity of the UK'. Mr Nicholas Winterton, the Conservative MP for Macclesfield, welcomed the prime minister's commitment to peace, but urged him to go to Northern Ireland to campaign for the union. The declaration was welcomed 'with enthusiasm' by Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, and by Mr Alan Beith for the Liberal Democrats. Most Labour backbenchers also welcomed the declaration. Mr Doug Hoyle, MP for Warrington North - in whose constituency two boys were killed by an IRA bomb this year - said the terrorists would never be forgiven if they failed to respond. 'It is time for all the paramilitaries to lay down their arms,' he said. The declaration was criticised by some Labour leftwingers. Mr Tony Benn, a former cabinet minister, said public opinion in Britain would support talks with Sinn Fein in advance of a cessation of violence.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

The Action Group on Northern Ireland Electricity Prices, which includes many of the larger industries in the province, says the tariff will mean increases of 15 per cent to 20 per cent, in addition to the 18 per cent price differential which exists between Northern Ireland and the mainland. Mr Michael Oliver, manager of Blue Circle's Northern Ireland operations, said: 'We're incensed by this. We cannot understand it in a recession. It can only mean that we shall have to lay people off.' Mr Oliver said he was taking the matter up with the government. The new tariff was approved by Offer, the electricity regulator, as part of the approach to the privatisation of Northern Ireland Electricity in November. It was designed to give NIE a sufficient rate of return to reflect the higher cost of power in the province. Electricity has traditionally been more expensive in Northern Ireland because of the shortage of locally produced fuels and its heavy dependence on imported oil. The new pricing formula will, however, oblige NIE to raise its prices at less than the rate of inflation in future. The province's Department of Economic Development said the new tariff would be introduced gradually and would not result in price rises for all consumers. It said some companies, which it declined to name, might see prices fall. Following the sale of Northern Ireland's four power generators earlier this year the forthcoming privatisation will consist of Northern Ireland's power distribution network. It will be sold in one piece and the intention is to introduce more competition in time by linking the province's grid to those of the Irish republic and Scotland.

TeleWest, the largest UK cable company, which intends to float on the London Stock Exchange before Christmas, is already planning a bid for the Northern Ireland 'local delivery licence', as cable franchises are now called. A consortium is being put together by TeleWest - a joint venture between TCI of Denver, the largest cable operator in the US, and US West, the regional telephone company. It is likely to include both Mr Tony O'Reilly's Independent Newspapers of Ireland and RTE, the Irish national broadcaster. The Irish Independent is already involved with a consortium, Princes Holdings, which operates cable networks in Cork and Limerick and a microwave broadcast service in the west of Ireland. The other shareholders are TCI and United International Holdings, a US cable operator. UIH is also likely to be involved in the Northern Ireland bid. The TeleWest consortium will be challenged by a consortium that includes Ulster Television, which is determined to be part of a bid although under broadcasting legislation it can have no more than 20 per cent. Ulster TV is believed to be talking to Comcast, the quoted US cable operator which is the eighth-largest cable group in the UK with wholly owned franchises in Teesside and Darlington and large stakes in franchises in London, Birmingham and East Anglia. Comcast and Ulster hope to bring in another local Northern Ireland investor before bids have to be in on January 23 next year. Applicants for the licence have to specify which parts of Northern Ireland they plan to cable and on what timetable. At least one of the other large cable operators in Britain is understood to be looking at the Northern Ireland licence. Normally the licence will go to the the highest bidder. Although the licence is for the whole of Ulster only cities and larger towns are likely to be cabled. Rural areas could be serviced by microwave broadcasting, but little equipment is yet available for the frequencies specified.   Companies:-  Telewest Communications Group.     Ulster Television.

Texmaco-Polysindo, the Indonesian manufacturer of polyester filament yarn and garments, is locating production facilities at a site in Antrim formerly owned by Akzo, the Dutch chemical company. It hopes to create 900 jobs over the next three years. The Antrim site, near Belfast airport, is to have two factories. The first company, Norfol, will make yarn from polyester chips, and has an annual production target of 20,000 tonnes expected to be reached by the end of next year. The second, Pan European Textiles, will focus on weaving and processing fabrics from the yarn with a production target of 5,000 tonnes within the next two years. The UK government, through the Northern Ireland Industrial Development Board, is to contribute Pounds 14.6m in the form of training and capital equipment grants and in facilitating a low interest loan. Industry analysts say Texmaco has been seeking a European site in anticipation of the EC raising tariffs and introducing anti-dumping measures against the third world. It chose Northern Ireland after looking at potential sites on the UK mainland (Leeds and Bradford), Spain, and France. Northern Ireland officials yesterday heralded Texmaco's announcement as a boost to confidence following a year in which the government's record for attracting overseas investment has been criticised. Dr Graham Gudgin, head of the Northern Ireland Research Centre (NIERC) said last night, however, that on past experience of overseas investment it was possible 'not all the promised 900 jobs will be created'.

0,FT943-4800 ,"FT943-4800 _AN-EIGDVADLFT 940907   FT  07 SEP 94 / Personal View: Ulster - not an issue for compromise      By J. ENOCH POWELL   Peace is preferable to war, and persuasion is preferable to force. Those are truisms which politicians need to respect - as much as, or more than, anyone else. But those who voice doubts about so-called progress (progress to what?) being made as a result of the IRA ceasefire are not breaking that rule. They have solid reasons for their scepticism. The beginning of wisdom in approaching Northern Ireland is to clear the mind of everything conjured up by the term 'sectarian'. If terminology there must be, it is not Catholics who are confronting Protestants - on that basis one could make no sense of the voting pattern at elections - but Irish nationalists confronting unionists. It is nationality, not race, not religion, which is at stake. On the issue of nationhood - that is, the question by whom are we to be governed - there cannot be peace through compromise or negotiation, and in Northern Ireland that is the great paramount issue. The British parliament ruled Ireland - or, what comes to the same thing, Ireland was ruled under the British parliament - from long before the parliamentary union of 1800 seated Irish representatives at Westminster. At the general election of 1918 the inhabitants of the north east of Ireland continued to send representatives to parliament, while the inhabitants of the rest of the island refused. The south voted itself out. Just as surely, the so-called north, meaning the six counties of Ulster, voted to stay in. That determination has not changed on either side since then. Listen to Gerry Adams, and you hear that. Look at the voting at general elections in Ulster, and you see that. The dispute is about nationality - about whom we are to be governed by. That is why it can only be ended if one side or the other is set upon giving way. The impression that there has been a deal done in secret which has not yet been revealed is thoroughly logical. The unionist people of Ulster are not fools. They know that what is at issue is an absolute, and they treat those, from the prime minister downwards, who talk about talks, about political progress, and about compromise and concession, as necessarily dishonest. Short of inventing a method whereby 'a man can serve two masters' there can be no peace in Northern Ireland so long as the right of the majority to their nationality is open to question. All down the years the perception that the British government really wanted rid of Northern Ireland has caused, maintained and fuelled violence. The Irish nationalists are not fools any more than the unionists. They know that the ballot'box will not put them into the nation to which they claim to belong. Ergo alternative methods must be used to bring the desired result about. The true disturber of the peace in Northern Ireland is the stance of British governments which have continually behaved as if they wished Ulster out of the UK. The Anglo-Irish agreement of 1985 was a prime example. Under it, Britain agreed to govern Northern Ireland only in combination with the Irish Republic. Certitude as to the future is the precondition of peaceable living in Northern Ireland. The superficially hard-faced reassertion, in practical terms, that Northern Ireland belongs for good and all to the UK is the sole condition on which tranquility will return. In the end it may be hard to foresee the UK formally withdrawing from the citizens of the north east of Ireland the right they have possessed from time immemorial to be governed within the UK. The day is long past for looking for a wheeze to disguise or to deny that right. That way lies more bloodshed and not less.

The Pounds 157m Belfast factory will be one of the largest investment projects in Britain in recent years. The aid was approved after the commission ruled that the factory, for the Hualon company, would not seriously distort the European Union's textile sector. The decision follows a 10-month commission investigation into the state aid package. It represents a considerable victory for the British government, which has been lobbying hard for the project in the face of opposition from some member states. The government, which argues that the project is badly needed to alleviate unemployment in Northern Ireland, had proposed providing the Pounds 61m worth of aid, or 38 per cent of the total investment. Although this level of state aid does not contravene European Union regulations for regional assistance, some member states have complained that the project would create an unfair distortion in the European textile market which is facing increased pressure as a result of international trade liberalisation and excess capacity. With Northern Ireland's low cost manufacturing base apparently one of the key attractions for Hualon, textile producers in South Europe have also expressed fears that the investment could draw jobs away from the rest of Europe in the sector. However, the commission yesterday said in a statement that it had weighed the positive regional impact of the aid against its effect on the EU textile sector and decided the aid met exemptions in state aid rules. Mr Karel Van Miert, EU competition commissioner, said: 'This project will be of prime importance for a region particularly affected by unemployment. 'It will reinforce the competitiveness of the European industry and considerably reduce the unemployment level in the Belfast area.' The project, which will be carried out in four phases spread over a seven-year period will centre on the weaving, dyeing and finish of polyester, polyamide and cotton fabrics. With the total industrial workforce in Northern Ireland currently standing at about 100,000, the new factory, which will be based in the outskirts of Belfast, could boost the workforce by 2 per cent.

In a letter to about 1,000 prominent Conservatives including the prime minister, Mr Leonard Fee, the senior unpaid Tory in the province, claimed Mr Major could 'destroy us all' by allowing himself to be enticed by 'media-hype, Irish blarney' and 'honeyed words'. His warning emerged as the government moved to reassure Unionists on the Major-Reynolds initiative by signalling that it may decide to give the go-ahead for a Northern Ireland parliamentary select committee within the next month. Under current plans, clearance for the committee could be given as a gesture of reassurance to Unionists if London succeeds in agreeing a joint declaration with Dublin to persuade the IRA to give up its campaign of violence. It is thought that a government undertaking to set up a body which has been long sought by Unionists would make them less likely to reject text that emerges from the Major-Reynolds process. An early decision to press ahead with the committee would risk antagonising nationalists, however. Mr John Hume, leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party, warned this week that such a move could endanger the Ulster talks process. London and Dublin are voicing mounting confidence that a joint declaration can be agreed before Christmas. Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, yesterday gave cabinet ministers their first briefing on last Friday's Dublin meeting between Mr Major and Mr Reynolds. In his letter to fellow Tories, Mr Fee, chairman of the party's voluntary wing in Ulster, said: 'If the government agrees to any form of devolved legislative government for Northern Ireland, it will be ensuring the break-up of the United Kingdom. 'The impression is given that 'talks' are designed to produce a solution which will appease the IRA. We do not see how this can be done without going back on the guarantees about Northern Ireland's place in the United Kingdom  -nothing less would satisfy the IRA.' He said last night that the letter - which he cleared with the Conservative Northern Ireland area council which he chairs - had produced favourable responses from a 'significant' number of Tory MPs. There was further reassurance for Unionists last night when Mr Andrew Hunter, the pro-Unionist MP for Basingstoke, beat Mr Peter Temple-Morris, MP for Leominster, for the chairmanship of the Tory backbench Northern Ireland committee. In Dublin, a spokesman for the Irish government said it was prepared to make a written commitment to downgrade its territorial claim to Northern Ireland to an 'aspiration' as part of an overall settlement package.

Labour officials said the report for Mr Kevin Mc-Namara, shadow Northern Ireland secretary, had been prepared before the general election. It had not been seen by the shadow cabinet, Mr Neil Kinnock, then party leader, or by his successor, Mr John Smith. The paper, which angered Unionist MPs was now 'invalid', Labour said. There was no question of Mr McNamara being sacked, it added. Mr McNamara confirmed that the options explored were not Labour party policy and he would not be offering his resignation. He also ruled out Labour backing an independent Ulster. However some of the leaked proposals were consistent with Mr McNamara's thinking on Northern Ireland - which has consistently infuriated Unionist MPs. Labour's 1992 manifesto pledged to work within the 1985 Anglo-Irish agreement 'to achieve our policy of unity by consent'. The discussion paper sets out a number of ways that objective might be achieved - including 'shared responsibility' between Britain and the Irish republic, and the Irish president and the Queen having joint sovereignty over the province. Mr McNamara plans to publish this autumn a discussion paper on Northern Ireland that will build on the leaked paper's proposals. He backs 'round-table' talks between nationalist and unionist politicians but believes unionists should not be allowed a veto, and that if negotiations break down, the two governments should look to set up new political institutions. The prime minister said the leaked proposals for joint rule were 'a recipe for disaster'. The Labour leader had 'an obligation to tell the people of Northern Ireland whether or not that is the policy of their party,' Mr Major said. The Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionist party, said the proposals were a recipe for 'civil war worse than anything we have experienced in the north of Ireland or the south of Ireland'. Unionist MPs' attacks on Mr McNamara diverted attention from his criticism earlier this week of Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, under pressure for a 'gaffe' at the weekend when he joked with reporters after a terrorist attack.

Ms Mowlam used her first Commons appearance in her new role to advise others involved in attempts to forge a durable settlement in the province not to dig in their heels in the hope that a Labour government would soon be elected. She said: 'No one will have anything to gain by prevarication and procrastination in the hope of a change of government. 'We have got to keep on trucking.' In a wide-ranging speech summarising Labour's position on recent developments, Ms Mowlam highlighted the party's support for the Downing Street declaration and the principle that there could be no change in Ulster's constitutional status without the consent of a majority of its people. But she also reaffirmed Labour's commitment to the unification of Ireland by consent. Promising that Labour would 'facilitate and encourage' a balanced constitutional settlement, she set out five required features for such a package. These were: Provisions ensuring that constitutional legislation in Britain and Ireland was 'mutually consistent' and consistent with the principle of majority consent. Strong devolved government in Northern Ireland elected by proportional representation. Parity of esteem and equity of treatment for both communities, reflected in fair employment, policing and the administration of justice. Deepening cross-border co-operation. Secure guarantees from both governments for any new constitutional arrangements. She called for assurance that the Treasury would 'keep its hands off' public spending in the province. In the first Commons debate on the province since the IRA and loyalist ceasefires, Mr Nicholas Scott, a former Tory Northern Ireland minister, called for long jail sentences of terrorist prisoners in the province to be reviewed. His contribution sparked an angry response from Mr David Wilshire, Conservative MP for Spelthorne, who said some Tories 'would find it absolutely impossible to go down the track you are suggesting'.

The nine Ulster Unionist MPs reckon their votes may well determine whether the government is defeated. But the expectation at Westminster is that no agreement would be reached until hours before the vote when the government would calculate if it was worth brokering for the support or abstentions of the nine Ulster Unionist MPs. The government's campaign to secure Ulster Unionist support may be linked to a complex agreement struck with Brussels over Northern Ireland's share of special EC assistance funds. Security policy and a Commons committee on Northern Ireland may also be part of any deal. In the early hours of yesterday morning the UK government mounted a desperate effort to preserve Northern Ireland's share of special EC assistance reserved for poorer areas of high unemployment. EC officials said the UK campaign appeared driven less by a desire to secure extra money to sweeten the Ulster Unionists, but more by a fear that Northern Ireland's position could be squeezed vis a vis Ireland. Ireland is the biggest per-capita beneficiary of the Community's special Objective One assistance. In the previous round, Dublin received two to 2 1/2 half times more funds per head than Greece, Portugal and Spain, who make up the EC's 'Poor Four'. This amounts to around Ecu1,000 per Irish head over the past five years - more than double Northern Ireland's share. The UK argued, apparently successfully, that the gap between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland was likely to grow even further as a result the 1994-99 EC budget deal which includes an Ecu15.5bn Cohesion Fund for the Poor Four. Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, agreed to take account of the UK demands to preserve Northern Ireland's position. He offered assurances that the UK would receive 2bn, the bulk of which is to be divided between the poorest regions: the Highland and Islands, Merseyside and Northern Ireland. Unionists are also looking for and more powers for local councils in the province, better scrutiny of Northern Ireland legislation in the Commons and a commitment on Northern Ireland's constitutional position. Although there appears to be no formal 'shopping list', the party's MPs had little inhibition in setting parameters for any deal. The Rev Martin Smyth, MP for south Belfast, said that for his colleagues to expect any movement by the government on the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement  - hated by Unionists because of the role it gives Dublin in Northern Ireland - was probably 'too high a price' and could 'hamper their own negotiating position'. Mr James Molyneaux, UUP leader, has deliberately kept a low profile over the past week, doing little to dampen speculation that he is looking for a deal. Three UUP MPs are due to meet Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, tomorrow before the voting beings. But any deal is more likely to be agreed in private negotiations between Mr Molyneaux and Mr Richard Ryder, the government chief whip, and Mr John Major.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

He cheered Unionist MPs by saying Conservatives stood 'four square' behind the union with Britain. But the prime minster's comments infuriated nationalist MPs and could set back still further the chances of round-table talks on Northern Ireland resuming this year. Mr John Hume, leader of the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party, said Mr Major was 'playing politics' while lives were being lost. Last night Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, wrote to Mr John Smith, Labour leader, asking for clarification of Labour's Ulster policy. Earlier Sir Patrick said uncertainty about Northern Ireland's constitutional status 'must make the task of the security forces harder.' The government has in the past tried to act as a neutral 'facilitator' in negotiations and has enjoyed backing from Labour for its efforts. It has said Northern Ireland will remain part of the UK as long as a majority of the population want that. But Mr Major firmly rejected 'shared responsibility' which, he said, would have to be imposed against the wishes the province's population. Separately, Sir Patrick provided further encouragement for Unionist MPs, telling the Commons that round-table talks could replace the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement with a pact that included a 'unambiguous statement' on the future of Northern Ireland. Mr Major's comments put the Labour leadership on the defensive. A spokesman said the document prepared for Mr Kevin McNamara, Northern Ireland spokesman, was 'invalid' as a policy paper - although he did not deny proposals for 'responsibility sharing' were under consideration. Mr McNamara later made clear that Labour was sticking to its 1992 manifesto of unification by consent. But he believes that, in the absence of agreement between local Unionist and nationalist politicians, London and Dublin would have a duty to set up new political institutions to replace 'direct rule' from Westminster.

Unexpectedly Mr Robert Atkins, the province's economy minister, said a number of outstanding matters needed to be resolved. 'The most important of these relates to the funding of the proposed interconnector to Scotland and an application which the government has made to the European Commission for assistance towards its costs,' he explained. 'The government strongly supports the application and hopes for its success, but recognises the need for the Commission to undertake a thorough evaluation of it. 'Consequently, although one option for the flotation of Northern Ireland Electricity (NIE) was November 1992, it will not be possible to complete the sale this autumn.' NIE and ScottishPower reached agreement on the Pounds 200m interconnector project earlier this year, and the government is believed to be seeking about Pounds 70m from the Commission towards the cost of construction. The first part of the sell-off took place in April when Ulster's four power stations went into private hands. British Gas bought the biggest station, Ballylumford near Larne; Nigen, an American-Belgian consortium, acquired Kilroot and Belfast West; and a management-employee buy-out team bought the Coolkeeragh plant at Londonderry. The sales grossed about Pounds 300m for the Treasury's coffers. It had been anticipated that the transmission, distribution and supply business would raise another Pounds 350m for the government. Advertisements have been running almost nightly on Ulster Television. NIE is the last UK electricity company to be privatised and is small and isolated in comparison with the distribution companies on the mainland, David Lascelles writes. The government is keen to create an interconnector with Scotland to improve sources of supply and sharpen competition. A link with the Irish Republic has also been proposed. The Scottish link, rated at 250MW, would be capable of supplying 20 per cent of Northern Ireland's electricity demand, although as the province's own generation capacity expands it might begin exporting power to Scotland. There are also plans to connect Northern Ireland to the UK gas pipeline network. The delay means that NIE will now probably have to wait for the completion of the sale of British Coal.

Following this sale of the last non-nuclear power company in the public sector, the next step in the government's privatisation programme is expected to be the disposal of its remaining shares in British Telecom. Yesterday's NIE announcement reinforced City speculation that the BT sale will be in late July. The government yesterday launched the privatisation of NIE, the first flotation to be targeted specifically at the Northern Ireland public, with a series of television advertisements featuring Finn McCool, a legendary Irish giant. The offer for sale will be in early June, with share trading expected to start in the week beginning June 21. Potential investors will have to wait until mid-May before the company publishes its pathfinder prospectus, including accounts for the year just ended and profit forecasts. The share price will be announced in early June. Mr Simon Linnett, a director of N. M. Rothschild, advising the government, said he could not yet say how much the government would realise, but he expected the order of magnitude to be 'about the same' as the Pounds 350m realised last year through the sale of the four Northern Ireland generating plants. Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, said yesterday that one of the government's objectives was to widen and deepen share ownership in Northern Ireland. At least half of the shares will be available to small investors who, like institutional investors, will be asked to pay for the shares in instalments over about a year. UK institutions will be given presentations in April and May. The initial allocation to them will be reduced if there is substantial demand from small shareholders. NIE customers will be eligible for incentives including bonus shares and bill-discounts if they register with the NIE share information office. Non-customers who register will be eligible for bonus shares, although on less favourable terms. Investors will also be encouraged by Finn McCool who, according to Irish folklore, bestrode the Giant's Causeway around 250BC. In one of two television commercials, McCool is shown emerging amid lightning and crashing boulders from a cliff-face. Investors in the rest of the UK will have to be content with newspaper advertisement images of McCool, as television advertisements are not being shown outside Northern Ireland.

Amid clear indications that Downing Street will announce in the next week that it is ready to hold exploratory talks with Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, told MPs he was planning new measures to reduce the impact of the armed forces' operations. Mr Rifkind said it would be irresponsible to cut force levels in Ulster prematurely. But he told the House of Commons that the government aimed to 'make the posture of the military patrols appear less aggressive to the public'. He said: 'It can never be normal for soldiers to be deployed on the streets of the United Kingdom. Our aim is to remove soldiers from the streets of Northern Ireland - but when it is safe to do so, and not a moment sooner.' The new measures will be implemented by the GoC (General Officer Commanding) Northern Ireland and the Chief Constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary. Yesterday, Rev Ian Paisley, leader of Ulster's Democratic Unionist party, reiterated that he would not take part in peace talks over the future of Northern Ireland in spite of the declaration of a ceasefire by loyalist paramilitaries last week. Mr Paisley condemned the negotiations as a 'counterfeit peace process' and warned that the IRA was continuing to arm itself. He reserved particular scorn for Mr James Molyneaux, the leader of the Ulster Unionist party, who made clear at the weekend that he endorsed the prospect of talks between the British and Irish governments and republican nationalists. Mr Paisley accused the UUP leader of 'crawling' to Dublin. Mr Molyneaux last night had 40 minutes of talks in Downing Street with Mr John Major, prime minister, on the situation in Northern Ireland. He is believed to have reaffirmed his tacit support for the British government's plans to hold preliminary discussions with Sinn Fein. The cabinet's Northern Ireland sub-committee is expected to meet this week to make preparations for such talks.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P9711 National Security.

In a scarcely disguised rebuke, Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, said he had been 'surprised' by comments by Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister. Speaking after a meeting of the Anglo-Irish conference, Sir Patrick said Mr Spring had apparently gone beyond the 'cardinal principle' that the constitutional future of Northern Ireland would have to be agreed by the province's population and political leaders. But Mr Spring said that it would be wrong for any option for Northern Ireland to be ruled out: 'If we are not allowed to put forward provocative ideas then we may as well all give up.' Irish officials said privately that the two governments had to be prepared for the possible failure of 'round-table' talks on the province. Mr Spring said that 'ultimately, responsibility lies with governments and I think that the governments have to make that quite clear'. The row reflected growing frustration in London and Dublin at the failure of the two governments to restart the talks involving Northern Ireland's main political leaders, which collapsed last November. Unionists say they will not re-enter until the Irish Republic modifies its constitutional claim on the north. Although his row with Mr Spring lowered still further the chances of talks resuming, Sir Patrick again refused to give up yesterday, saying: 'I don't visualise this process failing.' However, Mr Spring, while still commited to 'round-table' talks, has raised the possibility of the two governments going over the heads of local politicians and agreeing a political framework for the province, which might be put to referendums in Northern Ireland and the south. He said options could include shared authority or sovereignty of the province - both under consideration by the UK Labour party. But Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, and Sir Patrick have rejected such proposals.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.     IEZ  Ireland, EC.

We should not, however, lose sight of the fact that the principal objections of the European textile industry to the investment lie in the provision of Pounds 61m of assistance by the UK government to build a new plant in a sector in which there is already an excess manufacturing capacity within the EU. The industry has also voiced concern that the estimated number of jobs to be created by the investment is unsubstantiated by the information which has been publicly disclosed; furthermore, any benefit to Northern Ireland in employment terms is likely to be at the expense of jobs in other parts of the UK. Surely, in the light of these objections and the expected investigations by the Taiwanese authorities, the government should reconsider its support for the project, which is opposed by such a wide spectrum of textile interests, both in the UK and throughout the European Union.

He will ask heads of state meeting in Germany at the end of the week to approve a total of Ecus300m (Pounds 233m) to 'show the EU's solidarity with the people of Northern Ireland in their search for peace and reconciliation'. The aid, expected to meet no resistance from other EU leaders, will be used on urban and rural regeneration, unemployment, cross-border development and cross-community co-operation. Mr Delors has taken a close, personal interest in Northern Ireland's peace negotiations, frequently describing them as one of the most important things going on in the union. He said yesterday: 'We should seize the new opportunities for action in Northern Ireland and address the additional needs arising out of the peace process. This must be done now, to convince those on the ground that the peace process can yield real dividends to their lives.' The Ecu300m comes on top of an existing Ecu 1.23bn of aid for Northern Ireland in 1994-99 under the structural funds programme, and Ecu20m a year to the multinational International Fund for Ireland. The new aid, to be paid over three years starting next year, will go primarily to Northern Ireland but also to six bordering counties of the Irish Republic. The programme attached to the aid is based on the findings of a commission task force established by Mr Delors after the announcement of a ceasefire between the provisional IRA and the loyalists. The task force said interest rates on loans from the European Investment Bank should continue to be subsidised.   Countries:-  BEZ  Belgium, EC.     GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

As supporters of full integration of the province into the UK stepped up their campaign urging ministers to embrace their viewpoint, the octogenarian Mr Powell used a rare appearance on the conference fringe to condemn the government's Northern Ireland policy. The government had simply come up with a new version of the game-plan that had been in place for decades: 'Give Northern Ireland a new identity and we will soon get it out of the United Kingdom,' he said. The object of the conference, involving Ulster's main constitutional parties, which Mr John Major, the prime minister, hoped to convene was 'to recommend a measure of self government for Northern Ireland which will . . . enable it to be associated with the Irish Republic even more directly than it was by the Anglo-Irish agreement'. His assertion came as Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, told the party that the government's position was founded on 'an impregnable rock of principle' - that Northern Ireland's future depended on the wishes of its people. Britain and Britain alone was responsible for the government of 'this part of our country', Mr Hurd stressed. Aides said Mr Hurd's comments were directed at Washington rather than Dublin. Addressing a sympathetic audience of rightwingers, Mr Powell - the Ulster Unionist MP for South Down for 13 years until 1987 - attacked Washington's role in current efforts to forge a durable political settlement in the province. 'The US has ordained that the UK government is to use its best efforts to satisfy the IRA and the territorial ambitions of the Irish Republic,' he said. He predicted that the IRA would resume violence if it decided it would not achieve its objectives peacefully. Questioned by Mr Peter Bottomley, a former Northern Ireland minister, on whether he would urge people to vote against proposals incorporating 'some element of devolution' if they were backed by three of the four main political parties in Ulster, Mr Powell replied simply: 'Yes.' The role of the US was also attacked by Lord Tebbit, another former cabinet minister, who said President Bill Clinton thought he could 'push us around even in Northern Ireland as though this was a Caribbean banana republic'.

Chronic large-scale unemployment cannot but aggravate the troubles. In this context the question as to who will became the next chief executive of the Industrial Development Board (IDB) in Northern Ireland is of particular importance. This appointment is especially significant since the current rethink of government economic policy is heavily reliant on the operational competence of the agency. Independent academic research has demonstrated the IDB's undistinguished record in the past and failure to address the roots of Northern Ireland's lack of competitiveness. For example, job creation has substantially lagged behind that in other UK regions (the troubles cannot be used to excuse all of this difference) and the Irish Republic. Unemployment is forecast to remain at about 15 per cent well into the next century. Inward investment projects have experienced relatively high rates of closure (despite assistance traceable, in some cases, to the year of closure). The productivity of the manufacturing sector remains low. Northern Ireland's economic weaknesses derive in part from too much reliance on people whose training and experience is too narrow. This is reflected in the muddled way in which the IDB, and parts of the Northern Ireland civil service, are attempting to put their strategy into operation. The root weakness is longstanding poor productivity and very likely what is required is a shock which will project manufacturing on to a higher growth path. Not only is this unlikely to be delivered by those who have presided over failed policies, it is also doubtful if the required knowledge and ability exists in the province. Above all, new ideas are needed and a very generous remuneration should be offered in order to attract a widely experienced industrialist to the IDB post. Mr Peter Brooke, the Northern Ireland secretary, and Mr Richard Needham, Northern Ireland Office minister, should therefore cast their net very widely.

Nationalists in both countries see the Ulster peace talks as the trigger for a campaign to highlight the contradictions between the government's approach to Northern Ireland and its handling of Scotland and Wales. Nationalists intend to contrast the government's reluctance to acknowledge peaceful demands for Scottish and Welsh devolution with its willingness to negotiate with Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, if the Northern Ireland ceasefire holds. Mr Dafydd Wigley, president of Plaid Cymru, the Welsh nationalist party, yesterday stepped up the campaign at the party's conference in Llandudno, appealing to Mr John Major to recognise that Ulster and Wales have equal rights to self-determination. 'In the name of democracy, consistency and political justice, I appeal to the prime minister to recognise the morally indefensible position of denying these self-same rights to the people of Wales,' he said. 'If John Major can tell the people of the six counties of Northern Ireland that if it is their wish, democratically expressed, that they can unite with the Irish Republic . . . by what token can he deny that self-same degree of sovereignty to the people of Wales and of Scotland?' The issue was raised in the Commons on Thursday by Mr Alex Salmond, leader of the Scottish National party, in a barbed intervention at prime minister's question time. Congratulating Mr Major on the apparent success of his Northern Ireland policy, Mr Salmond pointed out that it hinged on the right of the people of Northern Ireland to determine their own future. 'For the avoidance of any doubt, will you confirm that you also believe in the right of self-determination for the Scottish nation?' he asked. Mr Major, who fell back on claims that devolution would raise taxes, appeared to have no answer to a line of questioning that promises to become increasingly embarrassing for the government.

They are trying to force a vote on this by canvassing support among Tory constituency organisations. Their amendment to the motion on Northern Ireland that will be debated at the conference also calls for the deletion of a reference to the courage of Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister. A letter to constituency chairmen from Mr Leonard Fee, the senior unpaid Tory in the province, argues that it would be 'distasteful to ask the party conference to praise Mr Reynolds'. The move emerged yesterday as Downing Street renewed its demands for an unambiguous assurance that the IRA has ended violence for good. The government's remarks came after Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, said during his US visit that he wanted 'a permanent peace'. 'I am not interested in any temporary suspension,' Mr Adams said. Mr Michael Mates, the former Northern Ireland minister sent by the government to shadow Mr Adams's US tour, said the remarks 'take us a little further. I happen to believe that the intention is that the end should be permanent, but he cannot say it.' The government has promised to start preliminary talks on how to admit Sinn Fein to the political process within three months of a permanent end to IRA violence. Tory party rules vest the 'absolute right' to decide whether to call amendments with the conference chairman, making it unlikely the Northern Ireland amendment will be voted on. However Mr Fee, chairman of the Tories' Northern Ireland Area Council, believes the party's high command could be embarrassed if a significant number of constituencies write in to express their support. He points out that although the vast majority of Ulster-related motions submitted to conference are concerned with 'strengthening the union and governing Northern Ireland as the rest of the United Kingdom,' these sentiments are not reflected in the motion selected for debate. Meanwhile, Ulster Unionist party members on their return from a US trip said they were interested in an all-party visit.

Labour officials said the report for Mr Kevin Mc-Namara, shadow Northern Ireland secretary, had been prepared before the general election. It had not been seen by the shadow cabinet, Mr Neil Kinnock, then party leader, or by his successor, Mr John Smith. The paper, which angered Unionist MPs was now 'invalid', Labour said. There was no question of Mr McNamara being sacked, it added. Mr McNamara confirmed that the options explored were not Labour policy and he would not be offering his resignation. He also ruled out Labour backing an independent Ulster. However some of the leaked proposals were consistent with Mr McNamara's thinking on Northern Ireland - which has consistently infuriated Unionist MPs. Labour's 1992 manifesto pledged to work within the 1985 Anglo-Irish agreement 'to achieve our policy of unity by consent'. The discussion paper sets out a number of ways that objective might be achieved - including 'shared responsibility' between Britain and the Irish republic. Mr McNamara plans to publish this autumn a discussion paper on Northern Ireland that will build on the leaked paper's proposals. He backs 'round-table' talks between nationalist and unionist politicians but believes unionists should not necessarily be allowed a veto, and that if negotiations break down, the two governments should look to set up new political institutions. The prime minister said the leaked proposals for joint rule were 'a recipe for disaster'. The Labour leader had 'an obligation to tell the people of Northern Ireland whether or not that is the policy of their party,' Mr Major said.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

0,FT932-8701 ,"FT932-8701 _AN-DERDAACIFT 930518   FT  18 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Ulster acquires prosperity without economic strength - Why the 'green shoots' are growing so vigorously in the province      By TIM COONE   FEW British politicians would ever be desperate or brazen enough to point to Northern Ireland as proof that the nation's economic policy is working as planned. But with local elections there later this week and the government trying to put its by-election and local election defeats behind it, the point could well be made in the days ahead. Not only has the province weathered the 1990s economic recession better than any other region of the UK, but those elusive green shoots of recovery are also appearing there in more profusion and with greater vigour than anywhere on the mainland. The latest batch of economic data and forecasts indicate that not only is unemployment falling steadily in Northern Ireland, but according to the London economic consultancy Business Strategies, 'in 1993 every sector of the province's economy is set to outperform the UK'. Any attempt to extrapolate this cheery outlook to the mainland economy must, however, take account of two crucial factors that have helped cushion the severity of this recession in Northern Ireland, and are influencing its recovery. According to Mr Graham Gudgin, director of the Northern Ireland Economic Research Centre, 'unlike the recession in the early 1980s, which was driven by a high exchange rate, this recession has been driven by high interest rates and mortgage debt'. House prices and mortgage debt are much lower in Northern Ireland than in the UK generally, so disposable incomes have been less severely hit, and neither has there been the 'negative equity' problem which is continuing to hold back consumer spending on the mainland. The second factor has been the role played by public-sector spending in the province. Forty per cent of the workforce in Northern Ireland is employed in the public sector, including the security forces, compared to 20 per cent nationally. The higher unemployment levels and higher dependency ratios in Northern Ireland have created the need for a relatively larger Civil Service in the province to deal with the greater demands placed on it for social welfare, education and health services. This is also reflected in the fact that Northern Ireland is a net receiver of Exchequer funds to the tune of Pounds 3.5bn, and is perhaps a warning to anyone wishing to draw a lesson from Northern Ireland's economic performance. As Mr Gudgin said: 'Northern Ireland has done well through the recession, but not for having an inherently stronger economy than other parts of the UK.' Mr Michael Smyth of the department of Applied Economics at the University of Ulster says: 'Northern Ireland has the highest regional population of two-income families, partly due to the large public sector here. So the drop in consumer demand during the recession has been nothing like as severe as on the mainland.' To underline this point, he called up a graph on his computer screen showing how bank lending has continued to grow steadily throughout the recession. 'The latest figures on hire-purchase credit also show that we have definitely turned the corner,' he said. There had been a particularly strong upturn in credit for car purchases during the first quarter of 1993. He was cautious on the longer-term prospects. 'The economy here is demand-driven by public spending and by demand from the mainland. Any real growth will be determined by GB demand and therefore will depend upon recovery there.' Weaker competitiveness will also act as a brake. According to Mr Gudgin: 'One question for Northern Ireland is whether productivity is now out of line with the rest of the UK due to the lower level of redundancies here. There could be a period of very slow growth in employment as the rest of the country recovers.' This view is echoed by Mr David Hitchens of the economics department at Queen's University in Belfast, who specialises in long-range forecasting. 'Competitiveness here is poor compared to Great Britain and the republic (of Ireland), and the basic weaknesses of the economy are likely to remain into the foreseeable future,' he says. Lower levels of management skills and higher levels of long-term unemployment, also due to a shortage of shop-floor skills, are widely considered to be behind lower productivity in the province and which have only recently begun to be addressed by the Northern Ireland Office with additional funds for training. Mr Gudgin points out that of the province's 105,000 unemployed - 14.1 per cent of the workforce - '40 per cent have been without work for more than four years'. The promising signals of recovery in Northern Ireland, recorded in the statistics and surveys of business confidence, thus tell only part of the story. Anyone wishing to draw comfort from them can have little cause for complacency.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P9311 Finance, Taxation, and Monetary Policy.

0,FT934-1977 ,"FT934-1977 _AN-DLPC5ACLFT 931216   FT  16 DEC 93 / The Joint Statement on Ulster: Major goes extra mile for peace      By DAVID OWEN   The nub of the deal - British recognition that Irish unity is a legitimate aspiration in return for Irish recognition that Northern Ireland's future should be decided by a majority of its people - may have been expected. But Mr Major seems to have travelled further along the extra mile for peace than his Irish counterpart. In terms of tone and choice of language some passages of the seven-page document were genuinely startling. Sinn Fein will have to think long and hard before turning away from the open door to the democratic process the two leaders have put before it. The British government's language on the Protestant majority's veto over any change in the province's status stands out when compared with past statements. The message yesterday was that Mr Major would 'uphold the democratic wish of a greater number of the people of Northern Ireland on the issue of whether they prefer to support the union or a sovereign united Ireland'. Two weeks ago the words he chose in Commons exchanges were: 'There is for us one fundamental point: Northern Ireland's status as part of the United Kingdom will not change without the freely expressed consent of the people of Northern Ireland.' Three years ago Mr Peter Brooke, then Northern Ireland secretary, said: 'The Union is affirmed by the first section of the Northern Ireland Constitution Act of 1973 which declares that in no event will Northern Ireland or any part of it cease to be part of the United Kingdom without the consent of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland. We stand firmly by that solemn declaration and assurance.' Mr Major's 'fundamental point' has not been conceded. But the language used to convey it has been transformed. Yesterday's declaration brings the government perilously close to joining the 'persuaders' - those intent on pushing Ulster's people towards a particular solution - as ministers recently indicated they would not do. Britain's role will now be to 'encourage, facilitate and enable' an agreement 'among all the people who inhabit the island' embracing 'the totality of relationships'. The declaration amplifies Mr Brooke's ground-breaking assertion in 1990 that Britain had no 'selfish or strategic or economic' interest in the province. The government's 'primary interest', it says, is to see 'peace, stability and reconciliation'. The passages on aspirations to a united Ireland are exceptionally tortuous. But their meaning will be clear enough to set alarm bells ringing in the minds of some union-ists. The government now accepts that an agreement 'may, as of right, take the form of agreed structures for the island as a whole, including a united Ireland achieved by peaceful means'. In view of the suspicion with which many unionists regard the development of cross-border institutions, they may be particularly concerned about the vaguely worded commitment by the two leaders to promote co-operation between north and south 'at all levels'. Early indications were that they viewed Dublin's intention to establish a Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, involving democratic parties on the island, with deep unease. Nationalists will welcome London's acknowledgement of a 'binding obligation' to pass legislation changing Northern Ireland's constitutional status if a majority of the province's people so wish. From the Irish perspective, the declaration acknowledges that imposing a united Ireland in the absence of the consent of a majority of the province's people would be 'wrong'. But it avoids any direct reference to articles 2 and 3 of the Irish constitution, which formalise its territorial claim, referring only to 'elements which are deeply resented by northern unionists'. Dublin's hand may also be detected both in the gentle reminder that the 1985 Anglo-Irish agreement in any case recognised the need for majority consent to any change in the province's status and in the near impenetrability of some of the language recognising Northern Ireland's right of self-determination.

0,FT944-5244 ,"FT944-5244 _AN-ELECYABPFT 941205   FT  05 DEC 94 / After the peace, the fight for jobs: Northern Ireland has much riding on its investment conference      By STEWART DALBY   More than 40 per cent of Northern Ireland's workforce is employed by the British government. Many of the jobs in the security sector - up to 20,000 - will be lost if the IRA and loyalist paramilitary ceasefires prove durable. The province's unemployed total of 100,000 would jump 20 per cent unless jobs are replaced. That is why so much is riding on the success of the international investment conference which takes place in Belfast on Tuesday and Wednesday next week. Mr John Major, the prime minister, is hosting the event and will be backed by US commerce secretary Mr Ron Brown. Invitations have gone out to leading international companies, organisations which have contributed funds in the past, local political leaders and leading EU trade officials. Northern Ireland has an urgent need to attract inward investment and it is prepared to pay generous incentives - as the controversial Pounds 61m grant to help the textiles group Hualon set up a plant has highlighted. The Industrial Development Board, which dispenses grants, has a powerful array of lures to attract foreign companies. A Northern Ireland incentives package can, in theory, amount to between 70 per cent and 80 per cent of total costs - though in practice it is usually far less. The IDB claims that in 1993-94 the government contribution to new investment was 21.5 per cent for both domestic and inward investment. The IDB says that since 1986 overseas investment has totalled Pounds 1.6bn, involving 265 projects and creating 22,702 jobs. The gross cost per job assisted in inward investment promotions in 1993-94 was Pounds 27,424 - meaning Northern Ireland has one of the most expensive job creation programmes in the UK. The IDB argues that it is necessary to spend money. The image of violence has been a powerful deterrent to new companies, but the province is also perceived by many outsiders as having a peripheral position in the UK. It has a population of 1.5m and therefore a small domestic market. Its economy is poorly integrated with that of the republic and the Irish Sea separates it from the mainland UK market. In trying to sell the province to investors, Northern Ireland officials argue that there are other factors apart from grants and incentives which make it attractive and offset its remoteness. Industrial land costs Pounds 40,000 an acre compared with Pounds 185,000 in the English Midlands and upwards of Pounds 400,000 in London. Construction costs are much lower. According to European Commission figures an index of office construction costs puts Northern Ireland at 65 compared with 100 for Britain and 113 for Belgium. Residential property is cheaper too. A detached house costs Pounds 57,202 in Northern Ireland compared with an average UK price of Pounds 94,315. The workforce is educated: Northern Ireland has excellent schools, with a higher rate of A-level passes than any other part of the UK. Wages are 16 per cent lower than in mainland Britain. The province can offer 50 per cent cash grants for buildings - more generous than either Wales or Scotland. It can also offer cash grants for machinery and equipment, training and job creation. If a company wants to rent rather than build a factory there are grants for up to 100 per cent of rental costs for up to five years. There are also product development grants, marketing grants, and grants for relief on loans. Although the province is handicapped in comparison with the Irish republic by having to levy corporation tax at the UK rate, companies making taxable profits of less than Pounds 250,000 pay a 25 per cent rate. There are allowances for depreciation on machinery and equipment and for the construction costs of industrial buildings. However, next week's investment conference is likely to be hampered by the haste with which it has been organised. An official at the British consul general's office in the US said: 'When we got the guest list our first reaction was 'Wow] - we haven't got time.' US companies are drawing up boardroom budgets and preparing for Christmas at this time of year. We think it is too short notice.' A guest list of US corporate 'possibles' was sent to the consul general only in early November by the Industrial Development Board and invitations began to be sent on November 18. When the speeches are over, those who have been able to accept the invitation will be invited to visit factory sites and companies which have already chosen to set up in Northern Ireland. They will be bombarded with statistics on why Northern Ireland rather than the Irish republic, Scotland or Wales is the best place in the British Isles to invest. And their hosts will be hoping they have done enough to overcome the problems that peace will bring.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Competitors for inward investment  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- There are variations in the level of assistance available.

In the first hints of proposals aimed at kick-starting talks on the province, Sir Patrick also envisaged greater co-operation between political institutions in north and south Ireland. Speaking at Liverpool University, he included energy and transport policies and water management as possible areas for co-operation. Sir Patrick hopes to re-start formal talks with Unionists, nationalists and the Irish government after the province's May 19 local elections. He is drawing up outline proposals as a starting point for talks - ending a near silence by the government on specifics of Northern Ireland policy since the first set of round-table talks three years ago. Sir Patrick balanced Unionist and nationalist aspirations and hinted strongly that he supports a central demand of Ulster Unionist MPs - a Northern Ireland select committee at Westminster. He also ruled out Britain and Ireland having joint political authority in Northern Ireland. The speech underlined the shift in Conservative thinking away from an overtly Unionist stance, towards a 'neutral' role. But his plans may revive Unionist fears that they have more influence to lose than gain from re-entering talks. The Reverend Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionist party, called the proposals 'a framework for the betrayal' of the province. But Mr James Molyneaux, leader of the Ulster Unionist party, said he was encouraged by the speech while Mr John Alderdice, leader of the Alliance party, said the proposals displayed a sense of realism. Sir Patrick said government systems based on simple majority rule 'were not successful before and they would not be sufficiently acceptable now. Such a system in a divided society could simply not be relied on to provide a fair deal for both sides of the community or to command the allegiance of each.' He said the current status of Northern Ireland as part of the UK would not change without the consent of the province's population. But he added: 'Correspondingly, there is no prospect of an agreement precluding a politically united Ireland if, at some future date, the public's view should change.' He added there was a new 'intensity' behind public calls for the resumption of talks.   Countries:-  IEZ  Ireland, EC.     GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P9111 Executive Offices.

Deputy secretary at the Northern Ireland Office since 1991, Mr Thomas has been a prominent and influential presence in behind-the-scenes negotiations in recent years. Deeply knowledgeable about the province's affairs, his solid track record has won him the confidence of Tory backbenchers and interested observers. A Cambridge man, educated at Perse School and Gonville and Caius College, his career began in the Home Office in 1966. He served on the crime policy planning unit between 1974 and 1976 and as secretary to the Royal Commission on gambling between 1976 and 1978. He was head of the Home Office's broadcasting department for four years from 1984 and moved to the Northern Ireland Office in 1988. He is married to the daughter of a former Treasury solicitor and his brother is a Bristol university professor. The European Investment Bank aims to more than treble its lending to Northern Ireland over the next three years, James Whittington writes. Sir Brian Unwin, the bank's president and chairman, said in London yesterday that he hoped loans of about Ecu30m (Pounds 24m) would be raised to at least Ecu100m by 1997 as part of the European Union's bid to bolster the peace plan. He said the bank would focus on long-term credit for small and medium-sized enterprises.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P9199 General Government, NEC.

Pressure for tougher security on the UK mainland was palpable at Westminster yesterday - although there was no consensus on specific measures, beyond greater vigilance. But Conservative MPs and the Labour party were determined to avoid 'knee-jerk' reactions. 'Today in the City, it is business as usual,' the prime minister told the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development. Mr John Smith, Labour party leader, said: 'It has to be made absolutely clear to the evil men of the IRA that . . . the nation as a whole will not be intimidated or diverted from their normal course of action by bombing.' There were no calls for a Commons' statement by the government. One loyalist Tory MP said: 'We keep on. The road is seamless. There is no great groundswell for a change of policy.' Yet a Commons debate may have revealed Conservative tensions over government thinking on Northern Ireland. Some Tories have joined Ulster Unionist MPs in expressing fears that the government is drifting too close to a nationalist agenda, encouraging the IRA to think it is making an impact. 'We need to make it quite plain that Ulster shall remain part of the UK and stop constitutional mongering that panders to the US and the south of Ireland,' said Mr Nicholas Budgen, Tory MP for Wolverhampton south-west. Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, has said Britain has 'no strategic interest' in Northern Ireland and that the province remains part of the UK because a majority of its population wants to be. Last Friday he ruled out a future political agreement in Northern Ireland that precluded future unification. Fresh protests from Ulster Unionists MPs came yesterday from comments by Sir Patrick in a German magazine when he went further than intended in saying Britain would 'very happily' release Northern Ireland if unification was supported locally. The remark was withdrawn immediately. However, it would be unfair to suggest that support for Northern Ireland's Unionist parties is unbending within Tory ranks. Mr Budgen admits he is in a minority: 'I don't think most of my colleagues have much of a view about Ulster, to be honest.' To an extent, there is indifference - few Tory MPs take a close interest in Northern Ireland; relations with the Northern Ireland parties are not often intimate. But there is also a consensus that, after nearly 25 years of 'troubles', Northern Ireland's problems have to be addressed through political talks. Events such as those that occurred on Saturday have to be divorced from that process. 'In spite of its murderous actions, the IRA does have a political rationale and that is a united Ireland . . . Any reaction based on a political solution is actually what the IRA wants to see happen,' said Mr Graham Riddick, Tory MP for Colne Valley. In practice, the successful resumption of political talks will depend on local factors. The biggest obstacle may be the reaction of Ulster Unionists to discussions between Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, and Mr John Hume, leader of the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour Party.

Mr Peter Brooke, Northern Ireland secretary, met the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party yesterday to discuss how to overcome the biggest obstacle remaining - whether talks could continue if interrupted by a general election. Mr Brooke is expected to meet Mr Gerry Collins, the Irish Republic's foreign minister, today to discuss possible ways forward. Meetings with Unionists are likely next week. The Northern Ireland Office said the chances of making progress were 'receding . . . but it would be wrong to stop at this point'. Mr John Hume, SDLP leader, objects to the Unionists' insistance that they could not necessarily continue talks if a Labour government were elected. He says that represents an additional 'pre-condition'. His party says talks should take place on the same basis as those last summer, when Mr Brooke succeeded in bringing the main parties to the negotiating table but failed to reach any agreement on Northern Ireland's political future. Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, is excluded from the talks. The imminence of the general election has altered the political atmosphere in Northern Ireland. Unionists object to Labour's policy of Irish unification by consent. Although officially it is denied, some Unionists may also be hoping to hold the balance of power after the general election. Mr Brooke had hoped for a meeting with all the province's political leaders this week but that plan appears to have been shelved. The talks he envisages would start with internal government in the province before considering relations between north and south Ireland and between London and Dublin.

Mr Molyneaux's remarks described the London-Dublin initiative as an experiment which had obviously failed. While the two governments might not be ready to admit it, he was prepared to transmit the message 'loud and clear'. In a BBC interview he echoed the complaints of other Ulster politicians over the decision by Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, to put his proposals for a devolved assembly in Northern Ireland to the government of the Irish Republic before constitutional parties in the north had been given the opportunity to help in its formulation. The government yesterday continued its efforts to step up its initiative among the constitutional parties when Sir Patrick met Dr John Alderdice, leader of the Alliance party. After the meeting, during which Dr Alderdice was briefed on the ideas submitted to Dublin, he said the session had been 'reasonably useful'. Sir Patrick is expected to see Mr John Hume, leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party, early next week. Mr Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionist party, again attacked the joint declaration as a bar to further political progress. But in a by-election for Belfast City Council yesterday, before which the DUP had campaigned on a rejection of the declaration, Mr Paisley's party suffered a fall in its share of the vote. A continuation of the conflict in Northern Ireland will cost the British and Irish governments an estimated IPounds 450m (Pounds 433m) per year with 75 per cent of the cost falling upon Britain, according to a study published yesterday by DKM economic consultants in Dublin, Tim Coone writes.

The company is closing its loss-making Peter England Shirt factory at Magherafelt, county Londonderry with the loss of 516 jobs. A further 50 people will be made redundant at the company's Maydown plant in Derry. Coats Viyella, the province's second-largest manufacturing employer, blamed the recession and an influx of cheap imports exacerbated by the weakness of the dollar. It is the second Northern Ireland shirt-making plant closed by Coats in the past year. Some jobs may be saved. Northern Ireland business interests have signalled that they might want to take over part of the Magherafelt operation. Coats said yesterday, however, that the possibility was remote. Intensive negotiations over the past four months involving Mr Richard Needham, the province's economy minister, and senior Industrial Development Board officials failed to secure a definite reprieve for the plant. The Peter England label is a mid-priced product that has been affected by imports. Coats supplies the same brand from outside the UK, largely in the Far East. It will increase sourcing from there to make up any shortfall. The company said it hoped to return its branded shirt business to 'an acceptable level of profitability'. It still makes the more expensive Van Heusen branded shirts in Northern Ireland. Sir David Alliance, Coats' chairman, said the company remained committed to its investments in Northern Ireland and would continue to employ more than 2,700 people in the province. In the past year it had invested or committed itself to invest more than Pounds 5m and it would continue to back profitable projects.  The Financial Times   London Page 12  "

A document called 'Breaking the Logjam', was sent to Downing Street yesterday with a request from Mr Ian Paisley, the DUP leader, for a meeting with the prime minister. The move has effectively bypassed the Northern Ireland Office, which has been working for the past 10 months to get the main political parties in the province back around the negotiating table. Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, brushed aside this latest snub. He said in Londonderry yesterday: 'I am concerned only to secure what the vast majority of everyday people in Northern Ireland want, namely to see the politicians talking. I am very interested to see whatever proposals any party leader may have.' The DUP has remained silent on the specifics of its new proposals, but it is thought they flesh out ideas on the DUP's favourite theme - the devolution of power to the province. Mr Peter Robinson, the deputy leader of the DUP, said yesterday: 'These proposals are an alternative to a process which has failed in the past and which is bound to fail if it is tried again.' He added: 'We do not believe that the process will produce a way forward.' Last Friday Sir Patrick and Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, met in London and reaffirmed their commitment to restarting the 'round-table' talks. These came to a halt last November, without agreement, and the DUP has since insisted that the Irish Republic must drop its territorial claim to Northern Ireland before talks can restart. The DUP has since set down a further pre-condition - that Mr John Hume, the leader of the SDLP, must end his talks with Mr Gerry Adams, the leader of Sinn Fein. Mr Hume said that his bilateral talks with Mr Adams, which started last April, were aimed at bringing about 'a total cessation of all violence' in Northern Ireland. At the weekend Mr Hume said he was also willing to meet with leaders of the Loyalist paramilitary organisations, following statements attributed last week to a leader of the outlawed Ulster Defence Association in a Belfast newspaper. The statements advocated political talks 'with everything on the table' provided the IRA ended its military campaign.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

0,FT933-738 ,"FT933-738 _AN-DI1CRABTFT 930928   FT  28 SEP 93 / Ministers seek to reopen Ulster talks with Dublin      By TIM COONE   THE GOVERNMENT of the Irish Republic yesterday confirmed that an Anglo-Irish working party is attempting to 'reconcile differences' in putting together a draft constitutional settlement for Northern Ireland with a view to reviving the stalled inter-party talks on the province. But it has also reaffirmed that the Republic's constitutional claim to jurisdiction over Northern Ireland would be modified to an 'aspiration' only in the context of an overall settlement. It emerged at the weekend that both governments had recently instructed their civil servants to draw up a draft constitutional settlement paper by the end of October which could be tabled at a new round of inter-party talks. The Irish government insisted yesterday that the constitutional issue 'will only be dealt with through a referendum which is part of an overall and balanced settlement'. For the UK, Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, said there would be 'no change whatever' in the constitutional status of Northern Ireland without the consent of its people. In Dublin an Irish foreign ministry spokesman said that 'different political and constitutional scenarios are being discussed and a joint (Anglo-Irish) working party is engaged in reconciling differences between the two government positions'. But there was a sense of confusion and perplexity in Dublin over the turn of events on the Northern Ireland issue, and suspicion that the latest statements coming from the British government 'are not unconnected with the Hume story', according to one official source. Last Saturday Mr John Hume, leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party, and Mr Gerry Adams, leader of Sinn Fein, announced that they are to submit a joint report to the Irish government on the progress so far of their bilateral talks, which have been taking place since last April. Proposals contained in the report are believed to set out a mechanism through which the IRA could be persuaded to abandon its 23-year military campaign, and which would then lead to an inclusion of Sinn Fein in the round-table talks process. It is thought that Mr Hume's current visit to the US is to seek a US government-appointed mediator to facilitate 'arms-length' contact between Sinn Fein and the British and Irish governments. An Irish government spokesman said: 'The government's objective has always been to try and stop the killing and establish a lasting peace (in Northern Ireland) . . . the government looks forward to hearing what progress may have been achieved in the talks between Mr Hume and Mr Adams.' A source close to Mr Albert Reynolds, Irish prime minister, said that Mr Reynolds 'will not be walking away from any proposal that might bring about (a political settlement)'. Mr Hume is due to brief Mr Reynolds in Dublin next week after his US visit. As Downing Street confirmed that the government was trying 'very hard' to get the talks process back on the rails, Sir Patrick stressed that the government would not 'talk or negotiate with' anyone who perpetrates or justifies acts of violence, in a statement pegged to yesterday's bomb explosion in Belfast. Lord Hulme, Liberal Democrat Northern Ireland spokesman, said it was dangerous that 'two separate blueprints for the future' now seemed to be in draft.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Mr James Molyneaux, the UUP leader, said multi-party talks under the old formula of nothing being agreed until everything was agreed were 'a recipe for disaster and failure.' He said the party was prepared to continue with bilateral discussions co-ordinated by Mr Michael Ancram, the Northern Ireland minister. The party's stance was condemned by Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, who said any attempt to reach an internal settlement in Northern Ireland was 'unacceptable'. Mr John Major also reaffirmed his support for the so-called three-stranded approach, covering relations within the province, between the province and Dublin, and between London and Dublin. The prime minister, who last night held talks on Northern Ireland with US president Bill Clinton, said Britain was anxious to draw a line under its dispute with Washington over the visit to the US of Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president. Launching new UUP proposals for devolved government in Ulster, Mr Molyneaux attacked Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, for 'to some extent torpedoing' the Ancram talks process by sending Dublin a checklist of ideas. There seemed to be 'a dichotomy if not worse' within the Northern Ireland Office, the UUP leader said. If Sir Patrick had not intervened, 'we might have been today in possession of a single document setting out the common ground of the four constitutional parties' in the north. Calling for the introduction of internment as part of an immediate clampdown on terrorism, he warned Mr Major that the UUP's special relationship with the Conservative party would be jeopardised if the government was not prepared to press on with restoring accountable democracy to the province. The centrepiece of yesterday's proposals was a call for the establishment of an 85-member Ulster assembly, elected by proportional representation. A separate three-member panel to oversee the assembly would also be elected. Its powers might include protecting the rights of the minority community. On relations with Dublin, the party said it would 'develop co-operation on matters of mutual interest and concern.' In the US, Mr Major emphasised that last December's joint declaration was not designed to provide a 'quick fix' in the province. It would stand to provide the foundation for a permanent settlement. The prime minister is thought to believe that the internal assembly sought by Mr Molyneaux would be vetoed by Mr John Hume's mainly Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party. This could wreck prospects for a durable settlement. Joe Rogaly, Page 20   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.     IEZ  Ireland, EC.   Industries:-  P9721 International Affairs.

0,FT934-12408 ,"FT934-12408 _AN-DJ0CNABOFT 931027   FT  27 OCT 93 / Major to discuss Ulster peace move      By KEVIN BROWN and TIM COONE      LONDON   THE Hume-Adams proposals for peace in Northern Ireland will be discussed on Friday by Mr John Major, the prime minister, and Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish premier, it emerged yesterday. The meeting was confirmed against a background of rising violence in Belfast in the wake of Saturday's IRA bombing in the Protestant Shankill Road, which killed 10 people. Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, said he expected both prime ministers to give the Hume-Adams initiative 'very serious attention on Friday to see where the process can go from here'. But Mr Major's determination not to alienate the Ulster Unionist party was last night reflected by signs at Westminster that the government was now ready to back unionist demands for the establishment of a Northern Ireland select committee. The prime minister has denied that he did a deal with the Ulster Unionists to avoid a Commons defeat in a confidence debate on the Maastricht treaty earlier this year. But with the tacit backing of Downing Street, the Commons procedure committee is expected today to give a positive response to demands for a select committee. Such a move would represent a clear signal of the government's commitment to ensure that any settlement in the province would have to secure the whole-hearted backing of the protestant community. Extra troops and police were moved to Belfast from elsewhere in Northern Ireland yesterday after two Roman Catholics were killed and six wounded in two separate incidents. Mr Major told the Commons the perpetrators of this week's terrorist attacks would be 'hunted down and subjected to the full severity of the law'. However, the government ruled out the reintroduction of internment. Sir John Wheeler, the Northern Ireland security minister, said there were 'no simple, easy solutions'. Downing Street continued to distance itself from the peace proposals put forward by Mr John Hume, leader of the mainly Roman Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party, and Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the political arm of the IRA. Officials said Mr Major was willing to talk to Mr Reynolds, but was more interested in reviving the stalled 'three-strand' talks under the auspices of Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary. In an indication of the sensitivity with which the issue is regarded in London, Downing Street said neither Mr Major nor Mr Reynolds had asked for a bilateral meeting in Brussels. British officials said the Brussels summit offered a 'useful opportunity' for a meeting, but stressed that there was no formal agenda. Downing Street also continued to maintain that Mr Major had not seen the Hume-Adams proposals, and was unaware of the details of the initiative. Irish officials said the Shankill Road bombing had 'seriously damaged' the Hume-Adams initiative, but Dublin appeared keen to keep the proposals alive. Mr Spring said the two governments had an 'obligation' to look at 'any opportunities' to bring about peace in Northern Ireland 'despite the (IRA) atrocity of last weekend'.

In an interview with THE SUNDAY TELEGRAPH, two leading  members of the outlawed organisation, which carries out  sectarian murders against Catholics in Northern Ireland under  the the title of Ulster Freedom Fighters, also warned that it  will continue its activities even if the IRA eventually calls a  permanent ceasefire.    The warning, in the wake of the IRA's refusal to extend its  three-day ceasefire of last week, will deal a further heavy blow  to John Major's peace initiative. The IRA resumed its campaign  early yesterday morning shortly after the ceasefire ended, when  shots were fired at two army checkpoints near Newtownbutler,  County Fermanagh.    The two UDA leaders, who described themselves as the heads  of  the UDA's southeast Antrim and south Belfast battalions, also  confirmed that the UDA has drawn up contingency plans in the  event of civil war in Northern Ireland, which they believe is  moving closer, and called for clarification of the Downing  Street declaration.    In what appeared to be a direct threat to members of the  Irish Government, one of the men said: ""There's a price to pay.  They haven't paid it yet...all their dues are being recorded  and they'll have to pay up.""    The Republic, they said, must abandon its constitutional  claims on Northern Ireland, and what they see as ""one  geographical state thinking"" aimed at removing Northern Ireland  from the United Kingdom and bringing about a united Ireland.    They described the Irish Government as part of a  ""pan-nationalist front"" that includes the IRA, Sinn Fein and the  SDLP [Social Democratic Labour Party]. The UDA's campaign would  therefore continue, they said, since in the event of an IRA  ceasefire the constitutional claim would remain.    One of them confirmed that the UDA would continue its  activities even were the IRA to lay down its weapons  permanently: ""There must be a prize for the IRA to call a  ceasefire. The reasons for it would have to be closely looked  at. Our days of reacting to the IRA are over as far as we are  concerned. Our agenda now is pro-active.""    The other man said: ""We see a grim future. I think civil  war gets nearer by the month, and that's not warmongering,  that's a fact.""    Anyone who believed that Unionists would allow themselves to  be drawn into a united Ireland was ""making a big  miscalculation,"" he said.    ""The feeling in our community now is that violence pays.  Morale has worsened since the declaration was signed. The only  people that we can trust are ourselves.""    The UDA leaders said that the joint declaration by the  British and Irish Government ""means nothing to us."" However,  they added that clarification would be welcome: ""The IRA want  to know ,what comes next. We would like to know that too.""    The two men said the UDA is stepping up its political  profile. A working party is drawing up a paper based on two  previous publications, Beyond the Religious Divide and Common  Sense, which favour power-sharing in Northern Ireland, and a  bill of rights. ""It aims to fuse the two together, and we  expect to publish it in about two months.""    They indicated that the UDA may propose an independent  Northern Ireland, which would have links with Britain and the  Republic within an expanding EC. Nationalists in Northern  Ireland would be allowed to pursue their aspirations  democratically, although institutional north-south links were  ruled out.    ""We can all be good Europeans, and are willing to extend the  hand of friendship towards London and Dublin. But we will never  be forced into a united Ireland.""     "

President Bill Clinton's nominally more interventionist Northern Ireland policy has been finessed since he took office into something much more palatable to the UK government. At the same time many members of Congress representing Irish-American constituencies are showing much less sympathy for the IRA than in the past, and are far less critical of UK policies. Both British and congressional officials credit the work of Mr Peter Brooke, the former Northern Ireland secretary, in starting peace talks. They also credit the 1989 Fair Employment Act, which went some way towards meeting US criticisms of job discrimination against Catholics in Northern Ireland - although some members such as Congressman Joseph Kennedy still have reservations. In addition, according to some congressional aides, the bomb that killed two children in Warrington earlier this year has further diminished the sympathy for the IRA. The practical result is that little concrete action is likely to be taken in the US this year on Northern Ireland. President Clinton has toned his promise to send a peace envoy down to a fact-finding mission, but the White House seems in no hurry to name its leader. At the same time the State Department has maintained its policy of refusing a visa to Mr Gerry Adams - president of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA - as someone who has engaged in terrorism, even though Mr Clinton last year said he favoured letting Mr Adams enter the US. Neither issue was raised at Sir Patrick's meeting on Wednesday with congressional leaders. While legislation has been reintroduced offering sanctions against breaches of the fair-employment principles of Mr Sean MacBride, the late Irish statesman, congressional experts say it is unlikely to move forward.

0,FT944-3759 ,"FT944-3759 _AN-ELMDEABZFT 941212   FT  12 DEC 94 / Peace primes Irish trade links: John Murray Brown on the potential for cross-border business      By JOHN MURRAY BROWN   In Belfast you can barely find a free parking space for all the cars from the Irish Republic, bearing their distinctive blue plates. In the wake of the paramilitary ceasefires the city is buzzing with Christmas shoppers - and some shopkeepers are even willing to accept Irish punts. Economists expect a boom in cross-border economic activity if the peace process holds. The potential is considerable. Two-way trade was about Pounds 1.2bn in 1992, with Northern Ireland incurring a deficit of Pounds 357m. Mr Paul Gorecki, of the Northern Ireland Economic Council, an independent advisory body set up by the government, says it would be wrong to exaggerate the differences between the north and south. He said: 'We're not dealing with East and West Germany or even the US and Canada.' Both have high unem-ployment, a high birth rate, a shrinking manufacturing base and an overdependence on exchequer funding, whether from the Treasury in Northern Ireland's case or European Union funds in the repub-lic's. Already Northern Ireland Electricity, the privatised utility, is to restore the north-south interconnector with the Electricity Supply Board. It was blown up by the IRA in the early 1970s. This will create savings for the consumer and provide both companies with trading opportunities. British Telecommunications is understood to be interested in opportunities arising from the privatisation of Telecom Eireann. Private companies are also refocusing on an all-Ireland strategy to maximise efficiencies. Takeover activity in areas such as food retailing will spur the process. There are difficulties, however. One is a lack of shared information on cross-border trade. Companies also face poor roads and telecommunications. Other problems are those associated with any foreign investment - the adverse currency risk and the difficulties in pursuing payment in a foreign jurisdiction. Historically the two economies grew apart at partition in the 1920s. Heavy industry such as shipbuilding, and the manufacturing sectors such as linen, brewing and distilling located in the north. The southern economy remained dependent on sales of farm products and commodities and over-reliant on the UK for much of its exports. The real constraint is political. The joint framework document which both governments hope will form the basis for a constitutional settlement for Ulster envisages greater cross-border economic links. Unionists are concerned, however, that this could be the nationalists' Trojan horse for their ultimate goal of a united Ireland. Investment is particularly contentious because it would involve the respective government agencies - Northern Ireland's Industrial Development Board and the republic's Industrial Development Agency. Mr Kieran McGowan, managing director of the IDA, said joint tourism initiatives and trade missions would benefit both agencies. He said: 'But with IDB we are competitors. We would talk about the issues that any competitors would talk about. If the ceasefire holds, that competition will intensify.' The strategies of the two agencies differ markedly - the republic relying on a 10 per cent corporate tax and the IDB enticing investors with big capital grants. So far much of the foreign investment on both sides of the border has been what Mr Gorecki at NIEC calls 'stand alone - easy entrance and easy exit'. The challenge for authorities north and south is to persuade existing and new investors to deepen their roots in the community, through more local sourcing and research links with local universities, and sharing subcontractors on both sides of the border. The private sector is setting the pace. Ulster Bank has an extensive network in the south - in small towns such as Killarney its branch offices display the logo in Gaelic. Monaghan Mushrooms in the republic, which accounts for 25 per cent of the UK fresh mushroom market, is one of a cluster of food companies near the border with Northern Ireland. Monaghan provides compost to small farmers on both sides of the border, buying back the mushrooms. The operation also provides pizza toppings for Heinz's Dundalk factory in the republic. Heinz's decision to locate in Dundalk was to take advantage of IDA incentives, and the proximity to the Larne port in Northern Ireland. Fruit of the Loom, the US clothing manufacturer, also operates on both sides of the border. Mr Gorecki believes with the peace in place, the first question will be whether the IDB can continue with its generous grants. This will depend on the IDA's strategy. Currently, the 10 per cent tax incentive in the republic is assured until the year 2010.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.     IEZ  Ireland, EC.

A partnership between Tractebel, the Belgian power conglomerate, and Associated Energy Supply (AES), the US power company, is likely to buy two more stations. The fourth will probably go to a management buyout team. The sale of the stations will be an important step in the privatisation of Northern Ireland Electricity (NIE), the electricity generator and supplier. A draft order providing the legislative basis for NEI's privatisation was passed in the Commons last night. NIE's four power stations will be sold as individual units. The company's electricity supply business will remain intact and will be sold to the public in November. British Gas is expected to buy Ballylumford, Northern Ireland's largest power station. AES, which has invested in a new power station in Kent, and Tractebel are expected to buy Kilroot, the newest station, and the old Belfast West station. The fourth, Coolkeeragh, will probably be bought by management. There will initially be no electricity pool - wholesale market - in Northern Ireland and the purchasers of the four stations will receive 15-year contracts to supply NIE. They will, however, still compete with each other through a bidding system. Another power station is likely to be built after NIE next month invites bidders to extend the life of existing stations or provide an alternative. A Labour government would not seek to return a privatised Northern Ireland Electricity to public ownership, Mr James Marshall, a frontbench spokesman, told the Commons last night.

0,FT922-11139 ,"FT922-11139 _AN-CD1A7AAWFT 920428   FT  28 APR 92 / Differences over Ulster objectives      By RALPH ATKINS   DIFFERENCES between British and Irish ministers' aspirations for Northern Ireland surfaced publicly yesterday - pointing to possible difficulties in 'round table' talks that are about to start on Northern Ireland's future. Ministers met in London and agreed a three-month gap in the regular Anglo-Irish conferences, allowing cross-party talks to start in Belfast tomorrow. They expressed a 'strong hope' that the talks, which collapsed last July and were revived ahead of the general election, would lead to 'a new beginning' for Northern Ireland and its relations with the UK and Dublin. Sir Patrick Mayhew, the new Northern Ireland secretary, and Mr David Andrews, the Irish foreign affairs minister, put different emphasis on the goals of the talks. Sir Patrick said it had been agreed that Northern Ireland would remain part of the UK as long as the majority of those living there wished it to be. 'Therefore the British government will rise from the (conference) table still holding to that reaffirmation.' He was also realistic in his hopes for the talks - suggesting that he might be content if agreement was reached only on a devolved government. Northern Ireland's population wanted politicians, 'to produce some kind of agreed accommodation that will represent an advance on circumstances which exist in Northern Ireland at the moment,' he said. In contrast, Mr Andrews said Northern Ireland's constitutional position in the UK, 'are matters, of course, that will have to be discussed in the talks.' He pointed out that Unionists wanted to discuss the articles in the Irish constitution that claim the territory of the north. 'If articles two and three of the constitution of our country are up for discussion, is there any reason why other constitutional positions are not up for discussion?' he asked. His comments might heighten Unionist suspicions about the Irish government's motives. Mr David Trimble, Ulster Unionist MP for Upper Bann, accused Dublin of 'a ploy to break down the talks'. His comments are not irreconcilable with Sir Patrick's views. Mr Andrews did not dispute that the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement says the province's constitutional position depends on the will of its people. The British and Irish governments announced a Pounds 66.5m upgrading of the Belfast-Dublin railway, a frequent target of terrorist bombings. The European Community will fund 75 per cent of the cost.

In response to 20 questions posed by Sinn Fein on the  Downing  Street peace declaration, the Northern Ireland Office issued a  statement saying the wishes of the greater number of people in  Ulster would be determined in a special poll.    The Government also drove home its message to the terrorists  to give up violence.    The statement bluntly told Sinn Fein to stop ""playing for  time"" and that democracy and violence cannot be reconciled.    The Government regards only one of the 20 questions put by  Sinn Fein as involving an explanation of the text of the Joint  Declaration.    In the declaration, the Government had said they would  ""uphold the democratic wishes of a greater number of the people  of Northern Ireland.""    Sinn Fein challenges the Government over the precise  definition of this phrase and asks how it would be measured in  practical terms.    The Government's comment is: ""The wish of a greater number  of  the people of Northern Ireland would be determined by a  numerical majority of those validly voting in a poll fairly and  explicitly organised for this purpose.    ""Provision for such a poll is made in Section 1 of the  Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973.""    In comments on the other questions, the Government  frequently  refers Sinn Fein to the text of the Joint Declaration, quoting  large chunks.    At the end, the Government poses its own question for Sinn  Fein, urging them to renounce violence in accordance with the  wishes of the people of Northern Ireland.    ""Democracy and violence cannot be reconciled. Sinn Fein must  choose. They know what they have to do if they are effectively  to fulfil their democratic mandate.    ""The democratic path leads to a meaningful role in the  political process: a process in which, as has been explained,  all issues are open for discussion and negotiation.    ""The alternative is isolation -- standing on the outside  while those committed to democracy shape the agreement,  structures and institutions that will determine the  relationships between the peoples of these islands.""    The Government says the majority of people in Ireland want  an  end to violence now.    ""Their wishes could not be clearer. There is no conceivable  justification for continuing to rob people of their lives, least  of all a call for a textual explanation of the Joint  Declaration,"" the statement says.    ""Sinn Fein asks what comes next. Certainly no further  playing for time,"" it warns.    Sinn Fein's questions were sent to the Northern Ireland  Office through the Irish Government.    Final agreement on the British Government's response was  reached at a Cabinet sub-committee meeting today.    Elsewhere in its commentary on the questions, the Government  makes clear that acceptance of the Joint Declaration is not a  precondition for entering the talks process.    ""What is required is a permanent end to the use of, or  support of, paramilitary violence,"" the statement says.    The British Government says it ""accepts the validity of all  electoral mandates, including that of Sinn Fein.""    It runs through what would happen if Sinn Fein and the IRA  renounced violence, saying exploratory talks would take place  after a three-month lapse.    These talks would explore the basis on which Sinn Fein would  be admitted to the peace process but without anticipating the  negotiations within that process.    There would also be an exchange of views on how Sinn Fein  would be able eventually to play the same part in the public  life of Northern Ireland as current constitutional parties.    The talks would examine the practical consequences of the  ending of violence.    The statement also makes clear: ""A lasting and general peace  would render military operations in support of the police no  longer necessary.""    Sinn Fein said tonight that they would examine the answers  they had received to see if they provided the clarification they  required.    Mitchel McLaughlin, Sinn Fein party chairman, said: ""Clarity  on the issues we have identified is in everyone's interest and  is crucial to the development of a viable peace process.    ""The response from the British Government can only assist in  the development of such a peace process if it provides direct,  unambiguous and comprehensive answers to the 20 questions we  have asked.""    He added: ""We will therefore be examining the British  response to see if it provides the clarification which we  require to make a properly informed assessment of the Downing  Street Declaration.""    Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams was today on the first of a  five-day trip to Italy. Sinn Fein said it would be faxing a  copy of the response to him.    It was thought unlikely he would make an off-the-cuff reply  before returning to Northern Ireland next week for consultations  with party leaders.    In its response the Government tells Sinn Fein that no  organisation has a veto over the peace process ""whether by  withdrawing from it or by refusing to renounce violence.""    It adds: ""An end to violence would open the way for a  comprehensive reassessment of existing provisions against  terrorism, many of which would become irrelevant and obsolete in  a climate of peace.""    Sinn Fein's questions probe a wide range of issues  surrounding the Joint Declaration, many of which the Government  responds to merely by quoting the document's text.    Only one of the 20 questions submitted to the Government by  Sinn Fein was genuinely seeking clarification of the Downing  Street declaration, Ulster Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew  indicated tonight.    He said: ""The rest of them are invitations to negotiate. We  are not going to negotiate. That is made very clear.""    Sir Patrick said on the BBC Six O'Clock News before the  Government had published the questions and its commentary on  them: ""We are facing something of great seriousness. We are  facing the continuance of violence for political purposes.""    He insisted that the future of Northern Ireland would be  decided ""by consent and democracy and not by violence or  coercion.""     "

About the same time as the Shankill  incident, gunmen belonging to the loyalist Ulster Volunteer  Force [UVF] opened fire on a group of Catholics who were  watching the Ireland-Italy football match on television in a pub  in Loughinisland, Co Down. Six of the Catholics were killed.    The Downing Street Declaration of 15 December 1993 was  intended and expected to lead to a cessation of IRA violence.  But six months later, IRA violence continues much as before.  The effect of the declaration was, meanwhile, to enrage the  Unionist community, and stimulate loyalist paramilitaries into  greater activity. The total level of violence is now higher:  Northern Ireland is in a state of incipient civil war. The  ""peace process,"" which is supposed to quench the flames, is  pouring petrol on them.    In its psychological effects on the two communities in  Northern Ireland, the ""peace process"" works like this: the two  communities are not in disagreement as to their understanding of  how the peace process is working. Both sides see the British  government as making concessions to nationalists out of anxiety  to be rid of the problem, and in the hope of buying off the IRA.  But their feelings about this are radically different:  nationalists are encouraged, and Unionists alarmed. And both  the encouragement and the alarm have the effect of stimulating  the extremists in both communities.    In an interview in Boston on Monday [20 June], the Irish  Taoiseach [Prime Minister], Albert Reynolds, announced that he  is seeking a form of Anglo-Irish cross-border authority ""with  executive powers."" This means that the nationalist demand is  being stepped up, from the ""consultative status"" accorded to  Dublin in the Anglo-Irish Agreement, to a share for Dublin in  the actual governance of Northern Ireland.    Almost incredibly, this provocative statement was made on  the  same day that the news had broken of the massacre in  Loughinisland. Mr Reynolds and his colleagues seem to have no  idea of the kind of impact that their words and actions are  making inside Northern Ireland, especially in the Protestant  community. And Mr Major and his colleagues also seem either not  to know or not to care what effect their trafficking with Dublin  is having in the same quarter. Neither government appears yet to  see the need for much more drastic security measures, applied  evenhandedly against both sets of paramilitary godfathers.  Internment is not ruled out, but neither is it yet being  seriously considered.    Mr Reynolds's apparent bid for a share in the governance of  Northern Ireland should not be taken literally.    I don't believe Dublin really wants anything of the kind. To  share responsibility with Britain for the governing of Northern  Ireland would be very onerous indeed for any Dublin government.  It would mean having to carry responsibility, before the  Catholic electorate of the Twenty-six Counties, for the actions  of security forces (however composed in Northern Ireland).  Those actions could well be seriously inconvenient to the  Catholic population in Northern Ireland and, therefore,  unpopular in the Republic. Consultative status is vastly more  comfortable, and it is most improbable that Mr Reynolds has any  real yearning to proceed beyond that point.    I think the real reason for the ostensible bid for  constitutional limits with ""executive powers"" was to fend off  change rather than bring it about. Mr Reynolds, it seems, is  under pressure from Downing Street to consent to the amendment  of Articles 2 and 3 of the Republic's constitution, the Articles  that lay claim, by implication, to Northern Ireland as part of  ""the national territory"" of the Irish State. Mr Reynolds does  not want to do this, because it would be unpopular with  important elements in his own Fianna Fail party. It might even  result in a challenge to his own leadership of his party,  something more vivid in his mind than the dimly conceived  reactions of people living in Northern Ireland (and not voting  in the Republic).    Albert Reynolds does not seriously propose to put the  amendment of Articles 2 and 3 to a referendum. But neither does  he want to irritate the British by a point-blank refusal. So he  makes a counter-proposition which he knows the British are  unlikely to accept and which, if they did, would be even more  obnoxious to the Unionists than the mere retention of Articles 2  and 3. So he makes the counter-proposition: ""We'll drop  Articles 2 and 3 if you give us a share in the government of  Northern Ireland."" That should hold Mr Major for the moment.    Mr Reynolds is primarily concerned with the internal  politics  of his side of the Border. The trouble is that the  repercussions of that kind of politicking on the other side are  becoming far more dangerous than the present Dublin government  seems capable of imagining. Already the nationalist  point-scoring that has become intrinsic to the ""peace process""  is costing more and more lives inside Northern Ireland. But  things could get far worse, and quickly.    Mr Reynolds may not be too worried about destabilising  Northern Ireland. He may even be gratified, as a politician, by  the political browniepoints his tactics are earning him from the  most benighted of his own backbenchers. But he should bethink  himself that a destabilised Northern Ireland could speedily  destabilise Republic, too. Driving a community n to desperation  is a dangerous business, and Ulster Protestants have been driven  far down that road. Further attempted progress down the  nationalist agenda could be fatal.    I don't think John Major is likely to make much further  progress. The results of the Downing Street Declaration have  hardly been encouraging for him and the parliamentary arithmetic  is against further concessions. But a future Labour government  would be under pressure to show itself even nicer to Irish  nationalists than Tories have been. In that connection, the  sort of thing Mr Reynolds was talking about this week -- joint  administration -- could well be attempted. If it were, it would  precipitate a revolt among Ulster Protestants. British troops  would be under fire from both sides, and British withdrawal  would follow. The consequences would be shattering, for the  North and the Republic.    In the Republic, there are some signs that people sense the  danger. The leader of Fine Gae, John Bruton, has been  courageously warning against the dangers of the course, and is  beginning to attract significant support. I am all for  opposition, in the Republic. But I live in mortal fear of a  victory by the Opposition in Britain, and its probable  consequences for Ireland.     "

He called on companies planning to attend next month's international investment forum in Belfast to consider placing Pounds 250,000 a year of new trade with Northern Ireland companies. He said the access of small and medium-sized companies to European Union funding should be improved. Mr Molyneaux warned MPs that there was still 'some way to go' in the peace process. He said Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, had 'not yet washed the bloodstains off the hands he now holds out to the world as a man of peace'. He added: 'The first step and only the first step has been taken by various paramilitary organisations.' In a sign of his influential role, Mr Molyneaux was watched by no fewer than five government ministers including Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor. Mr Molyneaux said his enterprise zone plan would 'create a dynamic economy driven by the private sector'. In another indication of the changing environment in the province, an Irish government official was yesterday among International Fund for Ireland representatives who appeared before the Commons Northern Ireland committee. It is thought to be the first time a Dublin civil servant has appeared before such a body. The fund, set up by the British and Irish governments to promote investment in the depressed economies of Northern Ireland and the border counties, could create up to 20,000 jobs over the next three or four years, Mr William McCarter, the fund's chairman, has said.

Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, said, after a four-hour meeting between the two sides: 'The great thing is that this process of talks is now continuing.' He added: 'It is hope that is at the top of our agenda - and hopes have been fulfilled.' The meeting marked the beginning of 'strand three' of the complex talks process, which brings together the British and Irish govern-ments as well as leaders of political parties in Northern Ireland. Last week the Rev Ian Paisley, Democratic Unionist leader, warned that the talks would fail if the Republic did not drop its territorial claims to the province. Yesterday Mr David Andrews, Irish foreign minister, said he had listened to Mr Paisley 'more in sorrow than in anger'. Mr Andrews added: 'I look forward to seeing him on September 2 for 'strand two' of the talks.' An official statement on yesterday's meeting said that the two sides had agreed an approach to arrangements for liaison on bilateral 'strand three' issues with the other participants in the talks. 'Initial consideration' was given to the 'interaction' of 'strand three' with the other two strands in the light of progress to date. British and Irish officials are also examining ways of opening up the public-sector purchasing process between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic to make it more accessible to companies throughout the island, as part of a fresh initiative to bolster cross-border trade. Mr Robert Atkins, a junior Northern Ireland minister, said yesterday that officials were 'exploring the possibilities' for a joint tender information system that would 'give comprehensive information on forthcoming tenders rapidly and cheaply to interested firms'. Opening up public purchasing fully to companies from all parts of Ireland would be a 'major stimulus' to trade between the two jurisdictions, he said. He added: 'Industry also needs to be confident that markets are genuinely open and accessible and that commercial decisions will be taken on purely commercial grounds.' In 1991, Northern Ireland provided just 4 per cent of the Republic's imports, with its largest share in the food, drink and tobacco sector.  The Financial Times   London Page 6  "
0,FT943-3200 ,"FT943-3200 _AN-EIOC7ADDFT 940915   FT  15 SEP 94 / Survey of Northern Ireland (9): Busy highway to Europe - A thousand cars a day pass through Larne port      By TIM COONE   Some of the elderly visitors to Northern Ireland arriving through Larne might remember the port from their World War Two days, writes Tim Coone. The huge logistical task of rapidly embarking hundreds of thousands of troops and tens of thousands of vehicles for the Normandy invasion in 1944 was tackled by routing part of the invasion force through Larne, making use of its ramp loading facilities - then almost unique - which allowed vehicles to be driven directly aboard the ships used for the invasion. Today, the same technique is allowing a different kind of invasion to take place: Larne now handles an average of 1,000 cars a day - 85 per cent of Northern Ireland's tourist traffic. Last year, 1.8m passengers travelled through the port, slightly more than the population of Northern Ireland itself. Moreover, Larne is now the principal roll-on-roll-off (ro-ro) freight port for Ireland handling an average of 550 container vehicles every day in each direction. In the UK, this makes it is second only to Dover. For Ireland's food industry and the growing number of companies following just-in-time manufacturing techniques that have chosen either the province or the Republic to locate their factories to supply the European market, Larne port is a vital link between them and their customers, some of which are located in the heart of Europe. Mr Denis Galway, the port's director and general manager, said that the frequency of sailings from the port and the short sea crossings enabled a road haulier to have a 40-ft trailer load 'in Paris within 24 hours and well into Germany in 48 hours.' Four ro-ro routes now operate between Larne and the British mainland, offering hauliers a choice of 18 sailings each way daily, evenly staggered throughout the day and night. Four ro-ro jetties, three with double ramps and the fourth recently having undergone a Pounds 7m improvement, ensure a rapid turnaround for the ferries and little delay for the hauliers. Individual loads of up to 180 tonnes can be accommodated. Half of the cargo handled through the port is perishable, such as meat and dairy products and fresh vegetables - 'speedy delivery for these is essential. With the frequency of sailings from here we can ensure that these products can leave Larne in the evening and be on supermarket shelves in Britain first thing in the morning,' says Mr Galway. Fruit of the Loom, the US clothing manufacturer, supplies the European market from factories located on both sides of the Irish border, using Larne as its main port to Britain and beyond. Mr Tony O'Reilly, the chairman of the Heinz food corporation, has cited Larne port as one of the reasons for locating a new pizza-topping factory for the UK market in Ireland rather than in England or Wales. According to Mr Galway, more than 20 per cent of traffic through the port originates in, or is destined for, the Irish Republic. The completion of the cross-harbour road and rail link in Belfast in February next year will finally connect Larne and the north-east of the province with the rail network throughout Ireland, opening up further possibilities of attracting new freight and passenger traffic to the port from the Republic. A rail freight terminal at the port has been proposed, while the passenger terminal is already one of the best and newest on the west of the Irish Sea offering airport-type facilities for passengers. Bus and rail services operate directly from the terminal. Even the personal hygiene of sweaty lorry drivers has been catered for - a special rest and shower room has been provided for them at the passenger terminal. Adjacent to the port, and owned by it, a 100-acre site is now being offered in lots of up to 10 acres for development which Mr Galway believes will be attractive to manufacturers and wholesale distributors looking for a location from where to supply their markets efficiently. A new era of competition for Larne began recently, though, with the appearance of new shipping on the Irish Sea. The Seacat service to Belfast, with its fast crossing times, has been able to take around 15 per cent of the tourist traffic into the province in the past two years. In 1993, Stena Sealink also opened up a new Seacat service from Holyhead to Dun Laoghaire (near Dublin), with an Irish Sea crossing time of only one and half hours (compared with two and half hours from Larne to Stranraer). Mr Galway acknowledges the threat but he says: 'We are not afraid of competition. We believe we can compete on price, and the evidence shows that ferry operators here have sustained their market share.'   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Ms Marjorie Mowlam, shadow Northern Ireland secretary, said ahead of this week's international investment conference in Belfast that measures taken on the economy were crucial to the stability of the peace process. Voicing concern about the government's economic strategy in Ulster she warned that an important opportunity would be missed unless ministers thought 'strategically and long term' about economic regeneration and restructuring. Aid packages from Europe, the US and elsewhere were 'crucial pump-priming resources', she said. But co- ordination was vital to make sure that money was not just 'thrown at high-status projects which do not assist infrastructure growth'. She said public investment was bearing the brunt of cuts in the government's public spending plans for Northern Ireland, unveiled last week, which would result in a Pounds 75m real terms reduction in the budget by 1997-98.

Increasing the pressure on Unionist and nationalist politicians to resume negotiations, the prime minister said: 'There is an opportunity to catch the mood, to achieve a political accommodation.' He would be proposing an 'early start' to new talks. Fresh reminders of the continuing terrorist threat came when a bomb exploded outside a Conservative club in London, causing disruption to rush-hour traffic at nearby Euston and St Pancras stations, but injuring no one. Earlier, three soldiers were wounded in an IRA mortar attack in Northern Ireland. Mr Major returned from Ulster yesterday evening to join Mrs Mary Robinson, Irish president, in attending a memorial service for the two victims of an IRA bomb attack on Warrington last month. US President Bill Clinton sent a strongly worded message condemning those who 'support and perpetuate' violence - suggesting he is determined not to give succour to IRA supporters in the US. Last night also saw the meeting in Ulster of IRA representatives with Irish Senator Gordon Wilson whose daughter was killed in the 1987 Enniskillen remembrance day massacre. After a meeting described as 'friendly and forthright', the IRA issued a statement saying 'peace will only come about' by recognising the 'proven failure of partition' and accepting the 'fundamental right of the Irish people to self determination'. The Northern Ireland Office yesterday appeared undecided about what the government's proposals for Ulster would involve. The government's move, however, will end ministers' past role as 'neutral' arbiters between local politicians and the Irish government. Sir Patrick Mayhew has said he would like to devolve wide-ranging powers to a new Northern Ireland administration - 'at least' to the same degree as the Stormont government that was suspended in 1972. Sir Patrick could also propose new mechanisms to involve the Irish republic in Northern Ireland and protect the nationalist minority. The main Northern Ireland parties appeared content yesterday to resume talks after the province's local elections in May - although they may be low key initially. However, the Unionist and nationalist traditions appear as far apart as ever on a political settlement. Mr Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionist party, said he wanted firmer assurances that the Irish government was prepared to negotiate away its constitutional claim on the north before he entered talks.

Repeated government denials that a deal had been struck to secure Unionist support in Thursday night's critical Commons votes were greeted with scepticism at Westminster. Mr Seamus Mallon, of the mainly nationalist SDLP, said: 'I think the talks are dead.' The Newry and Armagh MP added: 'If we go into future negotiations we will need to be very clear whether we are dealing with the government or whether we are dealing with the Conservative and Unionist party.' The understanding itself appeared to consist of a vague undertaking by the nine Ulster Unionist party MPs that they would look sympathetically at supporting the government in times of greatest need. In return the government would lend a sympathetic ear to their views on issues such as setting up a Northern Ireland select committee and restoring accountable democracy to Ulster. One Unionist MP said privately that the understanding had been set up at a meeting between Mr John Major and Mr James Molyneaux, Ulster Unionist leader, earlier this month. There was a hint in yesterday's Commons debate that a select committee might indeed be a part of such an accord. This came when Sir Peter Emery, chairman of the Commons procedure committee, reminded MPs that the body had 'recommended for some time that Northern Ireland should have a select committee dealing with their affairs'. Last night the Rev Martin Smyth, Unionist MP for South Belfast, said he expected changes soon. 'We expect the prime minister to govern us properly. Therefore we want a select committee in the very near future,' he said. Publicly, Unionist MPs were attributing their support for the government to a 'co-ordinated campaign' by Mr John Hume, SDLP leader, and the Dublin government to promote Labour's ideas for joint British-Irish sovereignty for the province. Mr John Taylor, UUP MP for Strangford, said the possibility of the Unionists voting with Labour was 'crumbling' more than a week ago. Mr Hume yesterday described the Unionists' theory as 'balderdash', a view echoed by Irish officials who insisted there was no 'hidden agenda'. Irish officials said privately yesterday that they remained 'cautiously sceptical' about Mr Major's denial. The circumstances surrounding the vote had done 'nothing to help UK/Irish relations'. One Irish official said: 'We don't like Northern Ireland being used as a chip in a poker game at Westminster.' The Irish embassy described as 'complete moonshine' suggestions that Irish officials, the SDLP, and the Northern Ireland Office had in recent days been in secret talks aimed at developing the idea of joint British-Irish sovereignty over the province. The Northern Ireland Office repeated Mr Major's denial of a deal and said it still hoped for political progress in the province. Meanwhile, the events appeared to have given fresh momentum to a whispering campaign within the parliamentary Labour party against Mr Kevin McNamara, its Northern Ireland spokesman. One Labour front bencher said yesterday he would be 'surprised if Mr McNamara stayed in the long term', adding: 'You cannot see him as a secretary of state.'   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, said he was determined not to allow the process to be derailed by the killings in a bar in Greysteel, Co Derry. But the peace initiative launched by the British and Irish governments was rejected yesterday by Mr Peter Robinson, deputy leader of the hardline Democratic Unionist party, who warned that Northern Ireland was close to civil war. Terrorists from both sides have killed 23 people in the past nine days in a cycle of violence provoked by last weekend's bombing of a shop in Belfast, which killed 10 people. The violence continued yesterday when an RUC officer was shot by the IRA in Newry. Mr Reynolds said Unionists had 'nothing to fear' from the initiative. 'As long as a majority of the people of Northern Ireland wish the present status to remain, that's the way it will be.' Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, said he hoped to arrange a series of meetings with Unionist leaders, probably lasting up to 12 months. But Mr Robinson said the joint statement issued by Mr John Major and Mr Reynolds in Brussels on Friday was 'an endorsement of the six-point plan for a united Ireland laid out last week by Mr Spring. Whoever it was aimed at, it was not aimed at Unionists because it is adopting a nationalist agenda'. However, UK ministers were heartened by the restrained reaction of Mr James Molyneaux, leader of the official Ulster Unionist party (UUP), who has made no public comment. The British government believes that constitutional guarantees and changes to parliamentary procedures for Northern Ireland legislation may persuade Mr Molyneaux to join the talks. The government is moving to set up a Commons committee on Ulster and may also end the use of non-amendable orders in council for Northern Ireland legislation. Other UUP leaders remained wary. Mr David Trimble, the party's home affairs spokesman, said Mr Spring was guilty of 'self-deception'. Mr Major, who is expected to make a statement on the peace initiative in the Commons today, said the killings were 'another evil act of butchery in which members of both communities were mown down'. He said: 'I appeal to all the people of Northern Ireland to show no tolerance to the gunmen and the bombers.' Mr Major is expected to distance the Anglo-Irish initiative from the proposals produced by Mr John Hume, leader of the nationalist SDLP, and Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing. Mr Hume said yesterday that the SDLP-Sinn Fein proposals remained the best prospect for peace. He said it was 'difficult to accept' that the Hume-Adams proposals had been dismissed by the London and Dublin. Mr Hume accused Mr Major of being unwilling to discuss the proposals. Downing Street said Mr Hume had not requested a meeting with Mr Major. However, the prime minister has said before that he is willing to meet party leaders, including Mr Hume, at any time. The British government is determined not to be seen to be talking to the IRA through Mr Hume, but is also keen not to undermine Mr Hume's position as a leader of constitutional nationalism in Northern Ireland. The prospects for the Anglo-Irish initiative will become clearer this week when Mr Spring meets Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, in Belfast.

Downing Street moved to correct what it said were 'inaccurate interpretations' of the prime minister's remarks in the Commons on Tuesday when he said he opposed 'extra assemblies . . . in any part of the UK'. Britain remained committed to finding new arrangements for government in Northern Ireland as part of a wider political settlement, it said. But Mr Major's comments led to Unionist accusations that he was creating confusion. They also betrayed tension between the Northern Ireland Office and the Scottish Office, which last week published its 'taking stock' paper opposing devolution in Scotland. Officials and ministers at the Northern Ireland Office have been worried about the impact of 'taking stock' on their attempts to balance Unionist and nationalist aspirations in the province. The Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionist party, yesterday wrote to Mr Major asking for clarification of his remarks which, Mr Paisley said, had undermined the purpose of political talks on the province last year.

'It is absolutely untrue. I have never heard such complete rubbish,' said Mr Mates. Mr Mates was identified by a leading unionist politician as the previously unnamed envoy alleged to have talked to Sinn Fein earlier this year. Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, has bluntly denied that any contacts have taken place with Sinn Fein, other than talks on local issues with the party's elected representatives. Both unionist and republican political leaders continue to claim privately, however, that contacts took place until just before the Ulster Unionist party agreed to support the government on the crucial Commons Maastricht vote. Republican sources say Sinn Fein was represented by Mr Martin McGuinness, its vice-president, who is said to have close links with the IRA. Mr Mates, who resigned as Northern Ireland security minister earlier this year because of his involvement with Mr Asil Nadir, the fugitive Cypriot businessman, said the allegations were 'black propaganda' put out by Sinn Fein. However, Mr Mates said: 'I suppose it is possible that some loony freelance Tory backbencher could have gone and had a meeting without telling anybody because you can never tell what loony Tory backbenchers are going to do. 'But I think I would have known about it if it had happened during my time (at the Northern Ireland Office) because we have ways of knowing these things.' The impression that progress towards peace in Northern Ireland is accelerating was reinforced yesterday by the UUP, which said it would continue to support the government even if it had been having secret talks with Sinn Fein. Mr Jim Wilson, UUP general secretary, said that in such circumstances, relations with Mr John Major, the prime minister, would be 'severely strained', but the party would not withdraw its support. Mr Dick Spring, Irish foreign minister, said on a visit to the US that there were 'grounds for hope and encouragement' in the offer made on Monday by Mr Major to talk to Sinn Fein if the IRA lays down its arms. He also called for 'an urgent response' to peace plans from Mr John Hume, SDLP leader, and Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Ministers were relieved to hear no criticism from Mr James Molyneaux, leader of the Ulster Unionist party. Mr Molyneaux reserved his anger for Mr Kevin McNamara, the shadow Northern Ireland secretary, whom he accused of acting as a spokesman for Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing. The government also received crucial support from its right wing. Mr Andrew Hunter, chairman of the Conservative backbench committee on Northern Ireland and a prominent supporter of the union with Northern Ireland, said Sir Patrick had acted 'entirely correctly and honourably'. The Labour party also supported the government's approach. Mr McNamara referred to the government's 'recent mishandling of these matters', but said it should not deter ministers 'from believing that risk-taking is essential if progress is to be achieved'. Opposition to the government came mainly from a combination of the Democratic Unionists, led by the Reverend Ian Paisley, and Labour leftwingers. This was reflected in the votes of 16 Labour MPs who joined eight Northern Ireland unionists in opposing Mr Paisley's suspension from the Commons. Mr Dennis Skinner, the Labour leftwinger, told Sir Patrick: 'In this democracy, when ministers say that they are doing one thing and yet behind the people's backs they are doing another, then there is a question of honour and resignation.' To Conservative protests Mr Skinner insisted: 'You ought to do the honourable thing and resign.' Mr Ken Livingstone, another Labour leftwinger, recalled that he had faced condemnation from successive Northern Ireland secretaries and from former prime minister Baroness Thatcher when he held talks with Sinn Fein. The Reverend William McCrea, Democratic Unionist MP for Mid-Ulster, said the IRA and Sinn Fein had been 'playing the government along'. Mr Doug Hoyle, Labour MP for Warrington North, said he and the people of his town wanted peace. 'But there was a feeling of outrage and revulsion there that contacts took place with Sinn Fein two days after the bombing in Warrington in which two small boys died and 56 people were injured - and one of those boys was still fighting for his life,' he said. The government received the support of Mr Seamus Mallon, deputy leader of the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour Party, who told Sir Patrick: 'You were right to enter the deliberations you entered into.

Mr Major told the Lord Mayor's banquet in the City of London that 'there may now be a better opportunity for peace in Northern Ireland than for many years'. He ruled out secret deals with terrorists, and insisted that the government would 'never' talk to organisations which declined to renounce violence. 'But if the IRA ends violence for good then, after a sufficient interval to ensure the permanence of their intent - Sinn Fein can enter the political arena as a democratic party and join the dialogue on the way ahead.' In his most optimistic appraisal yet of the prospects for Northern Ireland, Mr Major said there was a 'burning desire on each side of the community for peace'. He said the Irish government had shown 'a new understanding of the rights and concerns of unionists,' and most of the constitutional parties in Northern Ireland were 'purposefully' engaged in talks about a settlement. All the parties accepted that flexibility was needed, and that 'cherished positions' would have to be modified. 'These elements present the opportunity we are determined to pursue,' he said. Downing Street said the prime minister's words were intended as an 'explicit' demonstration that the government was 'very serious' about the peace process. 'Northern Ireland is something which the prime minister intends to keep on the front burner,' a senior official said. The speech also confirms that the UK government is prepared to press ahead without the participation of the hardline Democratic Unionist party, led by the Rev Ian Paisley, which has said it will 'never' talk to Sinn Fein, even after a cessation of IRA violence. The possibility that the British and Irish governments might be willing to talk to Sinn Fein was first raised in a joint declaration in Brussels last month by Mr Major and Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister. However, Downing Street said Mr Major's declaration last night clarified the government's position. 'It has never been explicit, as it is here,' said a senior official. The government dismissed reports in Northern Ireland newspapers that the government had held recent talks on a ceasefire with Sinn Fein or IRA leaders.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

As leader of the province's largest political party, with nine MPs available to bolster Mr John Major's slim Commons majority, in effect Mr Molyneaux has a veto over the government's proposals. At last year's abortive talks, a working party including all four constitutional parties agreed a blueprint for an 85-seat assembly with some legislative powers. It is this provisional model which provides the best pointer to how the new body might be structured. It is far from certain, however, that all party leaders would find it acceptable. The 85 assembly members would be elected under a system of proportional representation from the 17 Northern Ireland constituencies. Unionists would probably push for most legislative powers to be retained initially in London. But Mr Molyneaux accepts that even if the assembly began in effect as a regional council, its role would later be expanded if it functioned effectively. 'I have always said I am in favour of devolved government at as high a level as can be obtained without paying the price of unworkability.' The Rev Ian Paisley's hardline Democratic Unionist party has proposed that the assembly has a right to submit to parliament any proposal securing the support of 60 per cent of assembly members. There would continue to be a Northern Ireland secretary, but each of the Northern Ireland Office's departments would be answerable to an elected assembly member. There are now six departments, but they could be divided into smaller units. It is understood that agreement was reached for these departmental heads to double up as chairmen of the assembly's committees. A formula would be applied to try to ensure that the number of these positions held by each party was proportionate to its numerical strength in the assembly. The working party is also said to have agreed that a three-member 'panel' be set up, with its members elected in a similar way to the province's three MEPs. This panel could be given powers of adjudication over controversial matters. Under one possible mechanism, it would be brought into play if 30 per cent of assembly members so requested. Its role may include approving public appointments. In Mr Molyneaux's view, there is a 'fair chance' that Mr Michael Ancram, Northern Ireland minister, will be able to identify common ground enabling the parties to start the process of restoring accountable democracy for the province 'within a week or two'. He says he would back Mr Ancram if he secured agreement to the proposals outlined in the abortive talks. 'But if they find they cannot identify common ground at that level, they should move down the scale to the point where there is.'   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, will discuss in Dublin with Mr Dick Spring, Irish foreign minister, how unionist and nationalist political leaders can be persuaded to resume the negotiations which collapsed in November last year. Even before last week's local elections, which saw a better-than-expected performance by the hardline Democratic Unionist Party and Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, ministers from both governments were envisaging another Anglo-Irish conference before talks would resume. Now they may reconsider putting off the restart of talks still further. With the Reverend Ian Paisley, DUP leader, insisting his party will not return to talks until the Irish Republic compromises on its territorial claim to the north, the sense of political polarisation has increased. The moderate Ulster Unionist Party, led by Mr James Molyneaux, is also expected to be more cynical about talks. Sir Patrick has not commented on the local elections but the mood at the Northern Ireland Office at the weekend was that whatever the impact of the elections, there was no alternative to pressing ahead with restarting talks as originally hoped. It is also clear that Sir Patrick's personal initiative for restarting talks  -a paper being drawn up which will set out British government proposals for how Northern Ireland might be governed - will not provide an immediate catalyst to the resumption of negotiations. The proposals for a new devolved government in the province will not be presented to participants for some time. These suggestions may divide rather than unite them, by satisfying the demands of neither unionists nor nationalists. A crumb of comfort for Sir Patrick is the relatively good performance last week of the non-sectarian Alliance party in Northern Ireland.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Mr James Molyneaux of the Official Unionists, Mr Ian Paisley of the Democratic Unionists, Mr John Hume of the SDLP and Mr John Alderdice of the Alliance party, agreed a joint statement after a private meeting of just over an hour. The statement said the party leaders assumed that after next week's gathering there would be no further conference meeting before the election. Although the Northern Ireland Office last night welcomed the leaders' statement, it was not clear that all hurdles had been cleared to allow talks to start and the proximity of the general election would make the timescale extremely tight. A UK general election, if Mr John Major decides on April 9, could be called as early as the following week. Mr Major and Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, have made it clear that the basis of talks would be the same no matter who won the election. The two party leaders are to be asked next week to confirm these assurances in writing. Fresh impetus to break the apparent deadlock in the talks came from a Downing Street meeting held by Mr Major with Ulster party leaders earlier this month. Unionist and nationalist leaders agreed then to discuss how obstacles to formal talks, which had been postponed until after the general election, could be overcome. Mr Major called the meeting - the first for 16 years between a prime minister and all Northern Ireland's political parties - because of the escalation in terrorist violence in the province. There have also been claims that, by putting political talks on the back burner, the government was creating a political vacuum which could be exploited by terrorists. Mr Peter Brooke, the Northern Ireland secretary, is due to meet the four Northern Ireland leaders on Monday, and there will be a Commons debate on Northern Ireland next Thursday.

Ministers met in London and agreed a three-month gap in the regular Anglo-Irish conferences, allowing cross-party talks to start in Belfast tomorrow. They expressed a 'strong hope' that the talks, which collapsed last July and were revived ahead of the general election, would lead to 'a new beginning' for Northern Ireland in its relations with the UK and Dublin. Sir Patrick Mayhew, the new Northern Ireland secretary, and Mr David Andrews, the Irish foreign affairs minister, put differing em-phasis on the goals of the talks. Sir Patrick said it had been agreed that Northern Ireland would remain part of the UK as long as the majority of those living there wished it. 'Therefore the British government will rise from the (conference) table still holding to that reaffirmation.' He was also realistic in his hopes for the talks - suggesting that he might be content if agreement was reached only on a devolved government. Northern Ireland's population wanted politicians, he said, 'to produce some kind of agreed accommodation that will represent an advance on circumstances which exist in Northern Ireland at the moment'. In contrast, Mr Andrews said Northern Ireland's constitutional position in the UK was an issue 'that will have to be discussed in the talks'. He pointed out that Unionists wanted to discuss the articles in the Irish constitution that claim the territory of the north. 'If articles two and three of the constitution of our country are up for discussion, is there any reason why other constitutional positions are not up for discussion?' he asked. His comments might heighten Unionist suspicions about the Irish government's motives. Mr David Trimble, Ulster Unionist MP for Upper Bann, accused Dublin of 'a ploy to break down the talks'. His comments are not irreconcilable with Sir Patrick's views. Mr Andrews did not dispute that the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement says the province's constitutional position depends on the will of its people. The British and Irish governments announced a Pounds 66.5m upgrading of the Belfast-Dublin railway, a frequent target of terrorist bombings. The European Community will fund 75 per cent of the cost.

Britain remained committed to finding new arrangements for government in Northern Ireland as part of a wider political settlement, it said. But Mr Major's comments led to Unionist accusations that he was creating confusion. They also betrayed tension between the Northern Ireland Office and the Scottish Office, which last week published its paper opposing devolution in Scotland.

Renewed focus on both issues emerged at a conference held in the US at the weekend marking the 10th anniversary of the campaign in support of the so-called MacBride principles, which aim to promote civil rights and equal opportunity in Northern Ireland. The US conference was sponsored by Mr Alan Hevesi, the New York City comptroller (treasurer). He has signalled a plan to channel up to Dollars 100m (Pounds 60m) in institutional funds to Ulster in the form of 'Irish Peace bonds' and has already made clear his intention of encouraging companies to adopt employment practices based on the MacBride principles. The US conference was attended by Mr William Flyn, chairman of Mutual America, one of the biggest American insurance companies, who has helped co-ordinate private investor interest on both sides of the Irish border. At the conference both men made clear that US investor confidence in Northern Ireland remained dependent on progress in the peace talks and that any major inflow of capital would have to be tied to a political programme firmly linked to the promotion of equal rights. Mr Hevesi said yesterday that he was planning a 'significant expansion' of the MacBride principles campaign by aiming to influence corporate compliance with 'positive discrimination' towards Roman Catholics in British companies in which there was a significant US shareholding. Until now the campaign, supported by 18 US state legislatures, has played an important role in influencing the employment practices of US companies with operations in Northern Ireland. Mr Hevesi said yesterday: 'The environment for investment in Northern Ireland has improved dramatically as a result of the peace process, but progress towards the elimination of discrimination is painfully slow.' At the weekend conference Mr Flyn renewed his backing for the MacBride principles, and insisted that discrimination had no place in Northern Ireland. He was strongly critical of the opposition of the Reverend Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionist party, to the involvement of the US in the peace process. Mr Hevesi and Mr Flyn will be heading a strong Irish-American caucus at the Belfast conference which is determined to put fair employment and the continuing involvement of Sinn Fein in the peace process at the centre of talks with government officials. The UK government's position is that Northern Ireland's laws provide legally enforceable remedies against discriminatory practices. Yesterday Mr Hevesi released the results of a survey on employment practices of UK companies in Northern Ireland in which New York City has shareholdings, showing continuing religious imbalance at the workplace.

Mr Hume, in an address to the party conference in Blackpool, will rally support for Mr Kevin McNamara, shadow Northern Ireland secretary, in the face of growing criticism of his pro-nationalist approach. SDLP officials said that Mr Hume, a long-standing political ally of Mr McNamara, would pay tribute to the 'responsible role' in the peace process played by Labour's front bench. The depth of concern about the party's existing policy was demonstrated yesterday by the powerful conference arrangements' committee, which decided to allow a number of emergency motions on Northern Ireland to be debated. One of the motions, drawn up by the Independent Labour Publications pressure group, calls for a full review of Irish policy in the light of the Downing Street declaration and the IRA's open-ended ceasefire. Such a review would raise the prospect of a more neutral Labour approach to Northern Ireland, in line with comments by Mr Tony Blair since his election as party leader. Some leading members of the moderate Ulster Unionist party have suggested that the party's nine MPs might be willing to work with Labour after the next election if Mr McNamara and the unity-by-consent formula were dumped. Concern about Labour's nationalist approach is also spreading among MPs not normally regarded as close participants in party debates on the issue. Mr Mike Gapes, a member of the Commons foreign affairs committee, calls in Co-operative News for a rethink on Northern Ireland, warning against 'glib official slogans' such as unity by consent. He says 'Toytown trotskyist talk of colonialism' and phrases such as 'self-determination for the Irish people as a whole' can only worsen the province's problems. The party's unity-by-consent policy has been under severe strain since the IRA ceasefire. Mr Blair has given unequivocal support to the Downing Street declaration and to the government's promise of a referendum in Northern Ireland on constitutional changes. However, Labour's formal conference agenda, drawn up before the IRA ceasefire, contains only hardline nationalist resolutions.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

The move was seen as an attempt to placate Unionists  following their threat earlier this week to boycott cross-border  talks on the future of Northern Ireland, though the committee  was promised several months ago. But it angered Ulster's  nationalists and also threatened a row between the Government  and Labour over who sits on the parliamentary body. Mr Tony  Newton, Commons leader, tabled a motion for debate next week  setting up the committee -- which has long been sought by  Unionists and was suspected to be at the centre of a deal with  Mr Major last summer to secure support over Europe.    On the same day, the Commons will be asked to give its  annual  approval for renewing the Prevention of Terrorism Act -- which  will again put Labour on the spot as it opposes the legislation.    Ever since direct rule was imposed in 1972, Unionists have  objected to the way Northern Ireland business is handled at  Westminster without any effective monitoring by MPs.    The Government had resisted a select committee for Northern  Ireland, fearing it would degenerate into a sectarian squabble.  But ministers have judged the time is now right to establish  the group to bolster recent efforts to broker a settlement among  the political parties.    Nationalists have long harboured suspicions about a select  committee, which they see as an attempt to tie Northern Ireland  closer to the Union and cutting across efforts to win an agreed  settlement among all the parties.    Mr Seamus Mallon deputy leader of the SDLP [Social  Democratic  and Labor Party], said in the Commons yesterday that the  committee was being imposed against the wishes of a substantial  group of MPs.    Ministers, however, do not anticipate any boycott of the  committee, though they envisage fierce arguments over the  composition. The Government wants an overall majority, in  keeping with the convention that select committees should  reflect the balance of power in the Commons. But with none of  the main parties represented in Northern Ireland, the issue has  become complicated.    The committee is to have 13 members -- six Conservatives two  Labour, two Ulster Unionists, one Democratic Unionist, one  Nationalist SDLP and Sir James Kilfedder, the lone Popular  Unionist, who could be chairman and would ordinarily vote on the  Government side.    Labour is unhappy with such a balance, arguing that it  breaches all the rules of select committee composition set down  since 1979. They also want the chairmanship. A possible  compromise could be a 15-strong committee, retaining an overall  Government majority but giving Labour more seats.    The Government disputes any suggestion that the select  committee cuts across the three-strand talks process it is still  pursuing despite recent setbacks.    Earlier this week, Mr James Molyneaux, Ulster Unionist  leader, said that he did not see any future in talks involving  Dublin and that he wanted to concentrate on winning agreement  for new forms of government in the province.    However, he has not broken off contact with the Government  and further meetings are planned between the Unionists and Mr  Michael Ancram, Northern Ireland Minister, who is trying to find  common ground. Realistically, ministers do not expect any  movement on the talks process until after the European election  on June 9.     "

The Rev Ian Paisley (above), Democratic Unionist party leader (below), said he was devastated the government had been talking to the IRA while publicly denying it.

There was a 'chain of communication', but he insisted there had been no negotiation and no talks. Mr John Hume (above), leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party (below), told BBC Radio 4: 'I am trying to face up to the real problem in Northern Ireland, and that problem is of a divided people.

Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, said the British government had 'lied to their own parliament, to James Molyneaux and to the Irish and British people'. 'The process of dialogue and contact between the British government and Sinn Fein was more than a mere conduit.'

Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland Secretary, said  internment remained an option in the right circumstances and  emergency powers were available if required.    ""It isn't for nothing this Government insists on asking  Parliament to renew annually the provision for internment,"" he  said in Lisburn, Co Antrim.    ""It has been retained because the Government believes that  circumstances can be envisaged in which it would be necessary to  use that power.""    Mr Andrew Hunter, chairman of the Tory Northern Ireland  Committee, said now was the time for selective internment.    ""When heightened terrorist activity is expected or taking  place I believe that lifting 20 or 30 key people who are vital  to the command structures of such organisations could make a  major difference,"" he said.    ""I know it is an abuse of civil liberties but it saves  lives.  The escalating sectarianism of the last few days is a classic  example of a time to move in.""    However, the calls were resisted by Mr Kevin McNamara,  Labour's Northern Ireland spokesman, who said such a move would  ""completely de-rail"" the peace talks.    Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, urged that there should  be no Republican retaliation for Saturday's murder of six  Catholics watching football in O'Toole's bar in Loughinisland,  Co Down.    He was quoted on BBC Radio as calling for ""calm and  restraint"" in the face of a ""premeditated attack aimed at  deflecting those engaged in the peace process from that process.""    Mr Adams also confirmed that Sinn Fein would give its  long-awaited response to the Downing Street declaration within  the next week or so.    ""I hope the British Government has the political will to  move  this situation on, and so we can all move forward. Sinn Fein  will not be found wanting,"" he said.    Sir Patrick's comments on internment were a well-used  ministerial formula for dealing with the issue and did not  appear to mark any new policy departure.    Powers to detain suspected terrorists without trial are  available in the Emergency Provisions Act under which Northern  Ireland is governed directly from London.    Internment powers were last used between 1971 and 1975, but  the policy was too indiscriminate to be effective and the  detention camps became rich recruiting grounds for the IRA.    Mr Albert Reynolds, Ireland's prime minister, has  consistently rejected any question of internment in the  Republic. Britain argues that without Irish assistance,  terrorists would merely flee across the border and use the  Republic as a safe haven.     "

The Northern Ireland secretary made the assertion as MPs voted to set up such a committee by a majority of 103 (324-221). A Labour amendment to give the body more powers than those proposed by the government was defeated by 58 votes (298-240). The move will be widely seen as a reinforcement of the government's commitment to the province's unionist majority. Another cross-party committee of MPs will now deliberate on the detailed composition of the new body, which may start work soon after Easter. According to Mr Tony Newton, leader of the Commons, ministers have recommended that 13 MPs should sit on it and that the government should be expected 'to be able to command a majority'. The Tory proposals are thought to call for six of the 13 members to be Conservatives, with the government's effective majority kept intact by the presence of Sir James Kilfedder, the usually loyal Ulster Popular Unionist MP for North Down. Sir Patrick was goaded into his one-sentence intervention in last night's debate by a Social Democratic and Labour party claim that government consent for the committee was a 'political act'. Mr Eddie McGrady, SDLP MP for South Down, urged MPs to reject the government's proposal and support political talks between Northern Ireland's main political parties and the peace process 'against which this proposal will impact'. Mr Kevin McNamara, shadow Northern Ireland secretary, accused the government of allowing short-term party interest to take priority over the peace process. The 'primary reason' that the government had conceded a select committee was the need to maintain the 'understanding' reached with the Ulster Unionist party in return for the support of its nine MPs in crucial Maastricht votes. Mr McNamara also complained bitterly about the government's proposals for Labour to have only two seats on the committee and the SDLP only one. Ministers were proposing to 'gerrymander the composition of the committee,' he said. Opposition concerns were partly echoed by Mr Peter Temple-Morris, the Tory MP for Leominster, who warned that the move would be perceived as 'integrationist'. Mr William McCrea, the hardline Democratic Unionist MP for Mid Ulster, said he was 'delighted' that MPs would now have the right to scrutinise Northern Ireland ministers. 'Direct rule is remote. Ministers have to be brought to book,' he said.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P9721 International Affairs.   Types:-  NEWS  General News.

The gunmen opened fire with automatic weapons as customers at the crowded bar in the largely Catholic village of Loughinisland in Co Down watched the Republic of Ireland's opening World Cup soccer match on television. Five people were wounded. The Ulster Volunteer Force claimed responsibility for Saturday night's attack, saying it was in retaliation for last week's shooting of two Protestant men in Belfast. Police were last night braced for further sectarian violence. Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, condemned the killings as 'inhuman savagery' and said the gunmen would achieve 'no political purpose'. He pledged the RUC would never give up the hunt for the attackers. Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, said the incident had brought him close to despair. The attack prompted calls from Tory MPs for the introduction of internment as part of a security clampdown. Mr Andrew Hunter, chairman of the Conservative backbench Northern Ireland committee, urged the government to 'lift' 30-40 republican and loyalist terrorist ringleaders. He also called for the deployment of more troops on the province's streets. The attack came less than 48 hours after Mr Spring warned that a framework agreement on new constitutional arrangements for Northern Ireland was unlikely to be ready for next month's Anglo-Irish summit. However, Mr John Major, the prime minister, and Mr Albert Reynolds, his Irish counterpart, are expected to try to give new impetus to the peace effort when they meet at the European Union's summit in Corfu later this week. Mr Eddie McGrady, the Social Democratic and Labour party MP for South Down, said he hoped there would be no reprisal of any kind for the shootings. He said anyone attempting retaliation would be 'disowned by all our community and will not be acting on anybody's behalf'. Mr Kevin McNamara, shadow Northern Ireland secretary, cautioned against the reintroduction of internment, likening such a move to 'putting a lid on the cauldron' and saying it would end any prospect of constructive peace talks. The RUC Deputy Chief Constable Blair Wallace said: 'We are in the middle of a series of tit-for-tat killings. They started on Thursday and Friday and this was undoubtedly one of that series.' He said that but for the activities of the security forces there could have been more attacks 'because it is quite clear the terrorists are endeavouring to out-do the other in the enormity of their bloodlust'.

Talks between the political parties in the province are not  expected to resume before the autumn because of slow progress by  the British and Irish governments in drafting the framework  document, which is intended to provide a focus for the talks.    The governments had hoped to publish the document to  coincide  with a planned bilateral summit next month, but following a  meeting of the UK-Irish inter-governmental conference in Dublin  yesterday, Mr Spring admitted it would be ""difficult to meet  that timetable.""    Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, said the  framework document, which will flesh out the principles  established in December's Downing Street declaration would not  be ""a blueprint or template"" to which the parties would have to  conform.    But he stressed that it would have to address modification  of  the Republic's territorial claim to Northern Ireland ""if it is  to have any chance of success"" in bringing unionists to the  negotiating table. ""It is central to the problem,"" said Sir  Patrick.    Mr Spring said: ""There has to be compromise on both sides,  by  both governments."" Modification of the territorial claim would  be in the context of a ""balanced accommodation"" which would also  involve modifications to the Government of Ireland Act of 1920.    He referred specifically to Section 75 of the act, which  states: ""The supreme authority of the parliament of the United  Kingdom shall remain unaffected and undiminished over all  persons and things in (Northern) Ireland and every part thereof.""    Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, has indicated that  it intends to give its ""definitive response"" to the Downing  Street declaration early next month -- but is not now expected  to recommend an end to the IRA campaign.

Constitutionally, of course, 'Britain' does not exist. In its beginnings, to consolidate the kingdom as it emerged from the Wars of the Roses, England absorbed Wales; there remains a distinction on the rugby field and linguistically, but a uniform legal system is accepted. Later, to secure the Williamite coup and eliminate Jacobite pretensions, Scotland was associated with England to form 'Great Britain', though some distinctively Scots legal, ecclesiastical and educational structures survive. The 'United Kingdom' incorporating Ireland finds its origin in the Act of Union, 1801, passed as a security measure during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars. With partition of Ireland and of Ulster, since part of that province is in the Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland succeeded to the role previously assigned to the whole island. Evidently that union, between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, which defines the present United Kingdom lacks the antiquity, the consensus and the stability found within Great Britain. And even there, the status of each nation is different. It is interesting to compare the treatment of Scotland at the present day with that administered to Ireland during the Repeal and Home Rule periods of the 19th century, and speculate on its eventual consequences. Therefore, aside from the lack of selfish economic and strategic interests in Northern Ireland (Downing Street Declaration), there can be no doubt of London's constitutional and political interest.

In their article on Northern Ireland ('A break in the Irish mist', April 26) Ralph Atkins and Kieran Cooke, gave an impression of sectarian division which is considerably greater than the true position. It is not true, for instance, that only the edges have been chipped away from segregation in jobs. Catholics comprise about 37 per cent of the labour force and constitute 35 per cent of employees in occupations covered by the 1991 census conducted by the Fair Employment Commission. Excluding security jobs, for which they tend not to apply, Catholics comprise 36.5 per cent of employees: females appear to have more than a proportionate share of jobs, while males are about 2.5 percentage points short of full proportionality. Within this overall balance there is certainly a degree of segregation. This is partly due to geography, but goes further than this. Even so, only 5 per cent of companies have employees of a single denomination and most are small. Less than 10 per cent of employees are in companies or workplaces with more than 90 per cent one denomination. Nor is it true that only 10 schools out of 450 take both Catholic and Protestant children. The schools referred to are presumably integrated schools. These multi-denominational Christian schools have increased significantly in number, but are not the only mixed-intake schools. The education system in Northern Ireland is the same as that in England in that Catholic parents often prefer to send their children to Catholic schools. Other, predominantly non-Catholic, children attend state schools. However, Northern Ireland has a substantial number of educationally excellent state grammar schools, and some Catholic parents prefer their children to attend these. My own children's state school has 20 per cent of Catholics among its intake.

The privatisation of Northern Ireland Electricity (NIE), details of which were released by the government yesterday, will raise Pounds 353m for the company's four power stations, Mr Peter Brooke, Northern Ireland secretary, said in a Commons written answer yesterday. The sale of the power stations, effective from March 31, will form the first stage of the privatisation of NIE. The company's supply and distribution business will be sold to the public in November. British Gas will pay Pounds 132.4m for Ballylumford, in County Antrim, which generates half of Northern Ireland's electricity. Although the 1,000MW station runs on oil, British Gas has undertaken to convert it to gas, which will be imported through a new pipeline from Scotland. Two other power stations will go to a consortium of the US power company, Applied Energy Services, and Tractebel, the Belgian power conglomerate. The consortium will pay Pounds 214m for Kilroot, a 520MW station in County Antrim, and the 240MW Belfast West coal-fired station. NIE's fourth station, the 420MW oil-fired Coolkeeragh plant in Londonderry, will be bought by a management-employee team from NIE for Pounds 6.5m. Mr Richard Needham, Northern Ireland minister, said he was particularly pleased by the sale of Ballylumford to British Gas, since it meant customers in the province would not only have gas-fired electricity for the first time but might hope to have the choice of gas in their homes in the future. British Gas said it was delighted with the success of its bid, which would help to expand its power generation business, along with plans for other power stations in Bristol, London, and overseas. The company has set a subsidiary, Premier Transco, to build and operate the new pipeline, and a second company, Premier Energy Suppliers, to market natural gas in Northern Ireland. Mr Needham said the privatisation, which has faced strong local opposition from politicians, trade unions and other groups, would be a great confidence boost to the Northern Ireland economy.

The Association of British Insurers, the industry's trade association, confirmed yesterday that its members 'were giving serious consideration' to the introduction of an exclusion clause in commercial property policies for damage and business interruption. The move comes in the wake of the IRA's current bombing campaign and the April attacks, which included serious damage to the Commercial Union building in the City and are estimated to have cost Pounds 800m. It also follows discussions between UK insurers and their influential European reinsurers, who are concerned about their own potential exposure to terrorism. As discussions at the association continued yesterday, it was unclear whether the exclusion would affect domestic household policies. Further details will be announced later this week. The association stressed that policyholders may still be able to obtain cover by 'buying back' the exclusion clause, but companies seeking insurance are concerned about the potential impact on British business. It has already led to fresh demands from insurance buyers for the government to extend to the mainland the Northern Ireland scheme which compensates for damage caused by terrorists. The Association of Insurance and Risk Managers in Industry and Commerce (Airmic), which represents insurance buyers at more than 300 British companies, criticised the potential withdrawal of the exclusion clause. '(This will) leave British industry in a grievously exposed position,' it said. 'It will be impossible to protect assets and earnings against a real hazard exposure.' Airmic urged the Confederation of British Industry to start discussions 'at the highest levels' with both government and insurers to ensure 'terrorist activity does not achieve a major success in its campaign to undermine the British economy'. Under the Northern Ireland scheme, introduced in 1977, the government meets most of the cost of terrorism or riot damage. Claims under the scheme amounted to Pounds 33m in the 1991-92 financial year. Airmic said it believed the exclusion 'is being promoted by the influential continental reinsurance market'. Companies such as Munich Re of Germany, the world's biggest reinsurer, provide extensive reinsurance coverage to British companies. In a letter last month to UK insurers, Munich Re said: 'We would prefer to exclude terrorism from our reinsurance treaties.' The company said talks among UK insurers had been based on 'the consensus that the insurance and reinsurance industry cannot continue to pay for IRA terrorist attacks on mainland Britain'.

The interconnector, blown up on several occasions by the IRA in the 1970s cutting the province from the Irish grid, has become a symbol of the drive at cross-border co-operation on the back of the peace process. Following the IRA ceasefire on August 31, NIE has been in 'active discussions' with Ireland's Electricity Supply Board to agree the technical and commercial terms for supplying the south with power. Both companies say it will be relatively easy. All-island co-operation in areas such as energy, telecommunications and tourism are likely to increase in the wake of any durable political settlement for the province, as companies - public and private - look for cost savings. Just in the last week, the NIE and ESB have commissioned two cross-border emergency connections in the north-west of the province, an 'energy-poor' area. The project attracted support from a European Commission scheme. The north-south interconnector is also likely to win support from the European Union. Northern Ireland is due to launch a public inquiry on January 10 into the planned undersea link with Scottish Power. The NIE has a 15-year supply agreement with Scottish Power. Northern Ireland has allocated Ecu177m (Pounds 140m) of EU funds towards the scheme. NIE, Northern Ireland's largest company, said yesterday that the interconnector with the republic could be working again within five months. Agreement will also have to be sought on pricing, and other trading issues, once a study of demand is complete. 'It is not a massive project, but it has come to be seen as a political issue. We want to look at it as a simple commercial question,' NIE said. The company has four power stations, with total capacity of 2,300MW, which is 40 per cent higher than peak needs. A link with the south would enable it to meet ESB's projected increased energy demand. In addition, as a result of the one- hour difference in peak load times, a link would help lower consumer costs in the province by improving capacity efficiency.

Last week, the Unionists backtracked on a general election pledge and voted with the government on the social chapter vote, leading most observers to conclude - in spite of official denials - that a deal had been done involving a proposal to establish a Northern Ireland select committee at Westminster. Mr Reynolds emphasised that the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement gives the Irish government the right to be consulted on Northern Ireland matters. He said that Dublin would view any unilateral moves by the British government on the future governance of the province as a breach of the agreement.

The move could disrupt the conference as some delegates from the US have threatened to withdraw their participation if Sinn Fein does not attend. With US delegates yesterday already on their way to Belfast for the conference, it was not clear what position they would take before it is officially opened tonight. Sinn Fein last night signalled its intention to surround the conference in political controversy by saying that it planned to organise a lobby of overseas delegates. Under pressure from the US, the British government last week agreed that six Sinn Fein councillors could attend the conference. But last night Sinn Fein said the councillors had not been invited as members of the party and that its demands for equal status with other politicians had been rejected by the government. Mr Graham Gudgin, a leading Northern Ireland economist, said last night that politics was threatening to undermine the success of the conference. He said: 'Things are becoming very messy.' The government's handling of the conference was yesterday criticised by the Labour party as it launched proposals for economic regeneration in the province. Ms Marjorie Mowlam, shadow Northern Ireland secretary, said she thought there had been 'a lack of clarity of thought' about the conference. The party's 13-page document calls for a range of measures to regenerate Ulster's economy including a strategy for redirecting public spending towards investment. The document says the Northern Ireland Office budget should not be cut 'simply because resources are available from international sources'. All international aid 'is and must continue to be treated as additional to, and not a substitute for, public expenditure'. The paper advocates a package of measures for small businesses, including the establishment of a Business Devel-opment Bank to raise private finance for investment in the sector. It also urges a 'Northern Ireland skills audit' to target training funds more accurately.

0,FT921-12171 ,"FT921-12171 _AN-CA1BTAEYFT 920128   FT  28 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Ulster politicians agree to abandon talks effort - Brooke Meeting      By RALPH ATKINS   NORTHERN Ireland's political leaders agreed yesterday to abandon attempts at starting formal negotiations on the province's future until after the general election. Mr Peter Brooke, Northern Ireland secretary, aimed to minimise recriminations as he put efforts to resume 'round table' talks on hold during a 90-minute meeting at Westminster with the province's four main political leaders. The announcement may mark the end of Mr Brooke's painstaking efforts to reconcile Unionist and nationalist aspirations. In his two years in the province he has won rare praise for a Northern Ireland secretary after starting 'round table' talks last year, only to see them run into difficulties over procedural disputes. Although Mr Brooke's offer of resignation last week was rejected by the prime minister, he is expected by many to leave the Northern Ireland office after the general election. Ministers have felt frustrated that even the increased concern about terrorism in the province has failed to generate sufficient political will to overcome the main obstacle to talks - the question of whether they could continue under a Labour government. The appointment of a Labour secretary might lead to further delays in fresh negotiations - particularly if it was Mr Kevin McNamara, Labour's Northern Ireland spokesman, who is committed to eventual Irish unification by consent and is unlikely to win the confidence of Unionists. Mr Brooke agreed a joint statement with the leaders emphasising the 'great potential' of political dialogue. Ministers will continue to meet MPs from the province on economic and other matters. Mr Brian Mawhinney, Northern Ireland minister, is to meet nationalist and unionist representatives with the aim of promoting debate on alternative forms of government for the province. The statement agreed by Mr James Molyneaux and the Rev Ian Paisley, the two Unionist leaders, Mr John Hume, leader of the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour Party, and Mr John Alderdice, leader of the Alliance party, backed the broad structure of talks proposed by Mr Brooke. It went on: 'However, they concluded with regret that it was not possible in present circumstances to proceed to launch fresh substantive talks on the lines envisaged.'

First, there is a difference of view as to whether there is over-capacity or not in this sector of trade. Clearly Tim Smith, the UK economy minister for Northern Ireland, feels that there is unsatisfied, and indeed growing, demand for the product, whereas the European textile industry believes the opposite, a position the Commission initially agreed. Second, the Commission is quoted as saying that the project is of a low-technology nature, whereas the UK government is saying the opposite. Third, the project envisages the creation of 1,850 jobs whereas others contend that this level of employment is improbable. In this regard it is interesting that Tim Smith, in his detailed contribution to the debate in the FT ('A respectable and respected public corporation', June 3), makes no reference to the number of jobs that will be created. I should emphasise that the British Apparel  Textile Confederation is strongly supportive of inward investment in the textile industry in all parts of the UK. However, each case must be judged on its merits and surely, given the contradictions surrounding the Hualon investment, the whole case should now be reviewed by both the Commission and the Industrial Development Board before contracts are signed.

Meanwhile, the Commons moved closer to establishing a select committee on Northern Ireland when its procedure committee decided to examine how such a body might be composed. Politicians from all sides attacked the actions of Mr Adams who shouldered the coffin of Thomas Begley, the IRA bomber who died in the Shankill Road fish shop blast at the weekend. Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, said: 'We have seen photographs . . . of people in abject misery as a result of what happened in the Shankill Road and (now) we see Mr Adams carrying the coffin supporting one of those who did it.' The Democratic Unionist party yesterday condemned the 'hypocrisy' of Mr Adams, and said the show of solidarity between the Sinn Fein leader and the bomber of men, women and children indicated 'the nationalist leopard is incapable of changing its blood red spots'. Mr Adams last night defended his actions. He said his attendance had been made a matter of controversy. If he had been absent, it would have had the same affect. In the Commons Sir Peter Emery, Tory chairman of the procedure committee, made clear his support for a select committee by urging the government 'to look at our report and act on it'. The report, first drafted in 1990, supported the establishment of a Northern Ireland select committee at the appropriate time. Labour, which was opposed to re-opening the issue, accused the government of doing a secret deal with the Ulster Unionist party, which has long favoured the setting up of a select committee to scrutinise the work of the Northern Ireland Office. Downing Street said the establishment of a select committee was a matter for the Commons. However, the establishment of such a committee has become a touchstone of the relationship between the government and the unionists. Mr Tony Banks, a Labour member of the procedure committee, said the Conservatives wanted a Northern Ireland select committee as part of their 'pay-off' to the Ulster Unionists who helped the government avoid a Commons defeat in a confidence debate on the Maastricht treaty earlier this year. The Irish government is dismayed by the possibility that the British parliament might set up such a committee.

0,FT942-6389 ,"FT942-6389 _AN-EE4DFABNFT 940531   FT  31 MAY 94 / The Hualon Project: Authorities knew of management's criminal charges - The government is making a Pounds 61m grant for a Belfast textile plant. The company behind the project and on the failed attempts of EU officials to block the deal      By JENNY LUESBY and GUY DE JONQUIERES   On the morning of June 9, the UK's polling day for the European elections, the government plans to sign a contract agreeing a Pounds 61m grant towards the building of a textile plant at Mallusk near Belfast. The deal has progressed to this point although the government knew that senior managers of the company making the investment had been charged with - and in one case convicted of - criminal financial offences. The European Commission approved the grant in spite of strong objections from officials on competition policy grounds. And the economic case for the plant, which is to compete with low-cost Asian producers at the toughest end of the market, has been challenged by European industry bodies. The plant - to be built in a political stronghold of the Ulster Unionist party - will cost Pounds 157m, and will be the biggest inward investment in Northern Ireland since the De Lorean car plant was approved in 1978. De Lorean collapsed four years later with the loss of a substantial amount of government aid. After the failure of De Lorean, whose problems were compounded by financial irregularities, the government announced new procedures to assess project viability. These included looking at the 'worst-case scenario' and investigating the quality of management and the personal qualities and reputations of the entrepreneurs involved. The Belfast plant is to be built by the Hualon Corporation, a Malaysian subsidiary of Hualon, a quoted Taiwanese textiles, electronics and financial services group. The Oung family that controls the group nearly clinched a similar deal with the Republic of Ireland, in 1990 for Gillogue, Limerick. But Mr Des O'Malley, then industry and commerce minister, spent a week in Taiwan where he found investigations were under way in what later turned out to be one of Taiwan's most celebrated stock scandals. He said yesterday: 'We decided not to go ahead with the deal because the chairman of the company was arrested in Taiwan over an alleged share fraud. We had found it difficult anyway for about six months for them to honour the verbal agreement we had come to in 1990.' The case involved two of the Oung brothers: the chairman of the textiles subsidiary, Mr Oung You-ming; and the head of the group, Mr Oung Ta-ming. The brothers had sold 5m shares in an insurance company to the daughter of Taiwan's communications minister for one-fifth of their market value. The prosecutor alleged the transactions were for the 'improper enrichment of others'. But by the time the UK had approved the grant for a Belfast plant 21 months later, Mr Oung Ta-ming had received a sentence for breach of trust of 3 1/2 years' imprisonment - later reduced on appeal to 2 1/2 years - Mr Oung You-ming had jumped bail to Malaysia, and the communications minister had resigned. Mr Oung Ta-ming is appealing his sentence to a higher court. When Mr Chang Liang-chin, a Hualon group spokesman in Taiwan, was asked yesterday whether Mr Oung You-ming would return to face trial, he said: 'I don't know. Maybe some day.' Mr Oung Ta-ming and one of his brothers have faced other criminal charges since, but they were eventually dropped. Mr Oung Ta-ming is known to be one of a group of speculators known as the 'Big Hands', who trade up to a third of the daily volume on the Taiwanese stock exchange. Mr Robert Atkins, Northern Ireland minister until he was appointed environment minister in January, said the Hualon project was 'set in train' by Mr Richard Needham, his immediate predecessor at the Northern Ireland Office. Mr Atkins said he 'did not play too much of a part' in the project, and that detailed negotiations were handled by the Industrial Development Board, Northern Ireland's development agency. Mr Needham, now trade minister, was said by the Department of Trade and Industry to be on holiday and uncontactable. The development board, which arranged the grant for the Belfast plant, said it was aware of the controversy surrounding the Oung family, and of the outcome of the criminal cases. The Northern Ireland Office has refused to comment. The development board was enthusiastic about the project. It had been criticised for its performance on creating jobs in the province. The development board said the plant, to be based in the Ulster Unionist-held constituency of South Antrim, near Belfast, would employ 1,800 people on a continuing basis and generate 500 associated jobs. The plant will produce 23,000 tonnes of synthetic fabrics for low-cost clothing manufacturers in Europe, competing with Asian producers. However, European trade groups and some commentators question whether Hualon will be able to undercut imports from the Far East, and say that demand from European textiles producers, which has been contracting, cannot absorb the additional output. They also query the employment projections. The development board said its standard procedure for appraising and approving projects was confidential, but it was satisfied that all relevant aspects were considered. However, in December 1992, when the UK put the proposal to the European Commission, which has to approve state aid, Brussels was not impressed. It asked for more information and received three further submissions, in February, May and June last year. In July 1993, the commission said it was opening a full inquiry into the aid and told Britain: 'There is nothing in the arguments put forward to support your government's contention that Hualon's output will take the place of imports from outside the (European) Community.' The commission was also publicly sceptical about the UK's forecasts of a growth in demand that would absorb Hualon's output, describing its assumptions as 'debatable'. The investigation did not allay these fears. Soon after it began the UK government started lobbying the commission. Senior commission officials say at least one British minister indicated that London as well as Belfast had a political interest in the project.

0,FT934-7299 ,"FT934-7299 _AN-DKUAIABBFT 931120   FT  20 NOV 93 / Dublin urges London to legitimise unity goal: Tim Coone examines the painstakingly crafted wording intended to lead to a settlement in Ulster      By TIM COONE   THE LEAKED document published by the Irish Press in Dublin yesterday, which sets out the Irish government's view on a possible peace settlement in Northern Ireland, is a draft counterpart to an earlier, equivalent British government paper which remains secret. Both papers were prepared after talks between civil servants from both governments over the past two months. Final drafts from both sides are expected to provide the basis for a statement from the British and Irish prime ministers, tentatively scheduled for early December. This would provide a blueprint for a peace settlement in Northern Ireland and a basis for resuming round-table political talks in the province. The document is not a final draft, and has not been politically cleared at the top level. Indeed Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, yesterday said it had no connection with the peace process. Nonetheless the document is the clearest indication yet of what is seen in Dublin as a basis for a political settlement. It also indicates the concessions Dublin is seeking from the British government in return for dropping its territorial claim to the province. Its main points are: Both governments must 'be open to change' in their 'constitutional doctrines' relating to Ulster to reflect more accurately the divided loyalties there, and would be required to 'encourage the process of agreement among all the people who inhabit the island'. Both governments would recognise 'the legitimacy of the two major traditions that exist in Ireland  - those who wish for no change in the present status of Northern Ireland, and those who wish for a sovereign united Ireland achieved by peaceful means and by agreement'. A downgrading of Dublin's constitutional claim to Northern Ireland  - to an aspiration  - would be balanced by Britain acknowledging 'the full legitimacy and value of the goal of Irish unity by agreement, cherished by the greater number of people living in Ireland'. 'Objective meaningful expression and opportunity' to the aspiration of unification would be created through new Anglo-Irish structures and by incorporation of special provisions into any new devolved government structures in Northern Ireland. A new devolved administration in the province 'would assume executive and legislative responsibilities over a wide range of subjects (but) must secure widespread acceptance throughout both communities'. New north-south institutions mandated by both parliaments 'to discharge or oversee a range of executive functions' to be 'administered uniformly throughout the island'. These functions could be expanded by agreement with the new devolved administration. These institutions would provide the framework for north-south co-operation, especially 'for developing an integrated approach for the whole island in respect of the challenges and opportunities of the EC'. They would be subject to parliamentary scrutiny, 'including any new inter-parliamentary forum which may be set up by agreement between elected representatives north and south'. A standing UK-Irish conference would 'guarantee and monitor' a new agreement, and would have 'contingency powers of intervention and redress' in the event that devolved power structures in the province failed to abide by their obligations. Majority consent in Northern Ireland to any change in its status would be constitutionally guaranteed by the republic in a new agreement. The majority in Northern Ireland are fully recognised to have a right 'to withhold consent for any such change unless and until they are persuaded by democratic political means only, free from coercion and violence'. Negotiations on a political settlement would be only between those 'committed exclusively to constitutional methods and not with organisations who use, threaten or support violence for political ends'. Organisations which have 'demonstrably expressed their commitment to the democratic process by renouncing violence' would be entitled to a role in negotiations. Any new agreement would require endorsement by 'the people'  - an oblique reference to an all-Ireland referendum. It is thought the document has elements of the peace plans formulated by Mr John Hume, Social Democratic and Labour party leader, and Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein leader.

0,FT923-15024 ,"FT923-15024 _AN-CGDAHAAFFT 920704   FT  04 JUL 92 / Man in the News: Ulster's big man lets himself go - Sir Patrick Mayhew      By RALPH ATKINS   Usually urbane and upright, Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, has this week been restless and in peculiarly good humour. He chuckled before television cameras with Mr David Andrews, Irish foreign minister. In Winston Churchill's old Admiralty room, now occupied by the Northern Ireland Office, he cannot sit still. Only three months in the job, after nine years' service as solicitor-general and then attorney-general, the former barrister has a mischievous confidence. 'I never wanted to be a law officer . . . I came into politics to get away from the law,' he laughs. His cheer is understandable. Northern Ireland's wretched politics has taken a rare step forward. On Monday, Unionists, nationalists, and the Irish and UK governments will gather in London for the most wide-ranging discussion on the province's future since partition in the 1920s. The breakthrough is, in large part, Sir Patrick's achievement. His predecessor, Mr Peter Brooke, constructed a complex talks programme that nine weeks ago allowed nationalist and Unionists to return to the conference table. But Sir Patrick has this week cajoled the recalcitrant and suspicious participants to agree sufficient common ground for the Irish government to enter the negotiations. A chink of brightness has crept beneath Northern Ireland's gloomy history of failed political initiatives and unceasing terrorist killings. Whitehall insiders wonder whether Northern Ireland politics has entered a new chapter. UK Prime Minister John Major is not passionate over the direction Ulster should take; but he is determined to find a negotiated solution and has a warm relationship with Mr Albert Reynolds, Irish prime minister. Sir Patrick is more a pragmatist than a visionary. He is unusual among Tory Northern Ireland secretaries in having expressed to an interest in the position before his appointment. Oppressive personal security and the intransigent politics usually deter thrusting ministers. But Sir Patrick has a strong sense of duty and propriety. During the 'Westland crisis' in 1986 he demanded a full inquiry into the leaking, by the Department of Trade and Industry, of advice he sent to Mr Michael Heseltine, then defence secretary. Law officers' advice had to be confidential, he insisted. Colleagues report that he is a courteous, straight-backed English gentleman. He chooses a hard chair to fidget on, not the soft-leather settees in his office. His first press conference as Northern Ireland secretary was taken standing up. Sir Patrick describes Northern Ireland's politicians as 'engaging' - not an adjective that springs immediately to the minds of many Westminster politicians. Aged 62, the patrician air is enhanced by a rounded face, swept-back silver hair and his height. His national service army paybook said 6ft 4 3/4 in - two inches taller than the Rev Ian Paisley, the rumbustious leader of the Democratic Unionist Party and hitherto undisputed 'big man' of Ulster politics. The voice is polished but Sir Patrick is not pompous. His first instruction at meetings this week with the participants in the talks was to take off their jackets. He is businesslike, responding to flippancy with a drawn-out, condescending 'yeeaaas'. He is strongly Christian, but believes religion and politics have to be kept apart. In spite of his 'Paddy' nickname, Sir Patrick fears his Irish background is overplayed. His mother came from an Anglo-Irish Protestant family, which had been based in County Cork since 1263. But he was born in Berkshire, England, educated at Tonbridge School and Oxford. As MP for Tunbridge Wells, Kent, since 1974, he did not make a speech on Northern Ireland before taking office and first visited the province in the 1980s. More significant than his national identity, perhaps, is his family's familiarity with public service, which helps Sir Patrick fit into a job once described by Pravda as a 'colonial pro-consul'. A great grandfather was a first lord of the admiralty; a grandfather had a ceremonial post at the British viceroy's court at Dublin castle. His Irish roots have led to confusion among participants in the talks about his attitudes to Northern Ireland - a fog that may perversely have helped in recent weeks and which he has shown little inclination to clear. Irish diplomats were initially sceptical. As attorney-general, he presided over fierce rows between the UK and Ireland over extradition, and upset nationalists by refusing to prosecute Royal Ulster Constabulary officers for alleged 'shoot to kill' offences. But his appreciation of Irish history has forced a reappraisal. 'He may be a southern Irish Unionist but, first and foremost, he is a Cork man,' says one Irish official. Unionists have similarly mixed feelings. They like his dedication but are not convinced of his motives. Southern Ireland Anglo-Irish families 'are the sort of people who run up the Union Jack one day and then the Irish tricolour the next', says a Unionist MP. With the current round of Northern Ireland talks intended to be private, Sir Patrick wants to limit public utterances. Yet he says that ultimately the Northern Ireland secretary has to work himself out of existence. 'My job is to relieve the people of Northern Ireland of the indignity of having their local affairs governed for them by Westminster ministers. It is an indignity, it is an affront and I also think it is an absurdity.' He is also surprisingly ambitious about what might be achieved by political talks, apparently rejecting any suggestion that Northern Ireland could be ruled like any other part of the UK. Since 1972, when the Unionist-dominated Stormont parliament was dissolved, the UK government has tried to enable Northern Ireland to become self-governing, 'to the extent at least that it was when Stormont had jurisdiction'. It is probably too much to expect Sir Patrick to get that far. Only a month is left before the time set aside for the talks expires. A new political settlement - if one can ever be achieved - will almost certainly require a fresh set of talks later this year. And, probably, another after that. Sir Patrick's high spirits will be tested.  The Financial Times   London Page 6  "

The 'peace grants', targeted mainly on creating jobs and improving infrastructure, could total Ecu625m (Pounds 490m) in new money between 1995 and 1999. Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president, briefed foreign ministers meeting in Brussels on the shape of the peace package, put together for the whole of Northern Ireland and the six bordering counties of the Irish Republic. The Commission is expected to agree a final proposal for Essen on December 7, and has been consulting widely at grassroots level in the pro-British Unionist and Irish nationalist communities in the province. Senior officials in London and Dublin say both governments endorse the initiative. 'It's virtually gift-wrapped for Essen,' one Irish official said. Brussels is suggesting an initial commitment of Ecu300m from the EU budget for 1995-97, with an extension of the same rate of new funding - Ecu100m a year - for a further two years if the scheme is working. About 80 per cent of this would go to Northern Ireland and the rest to the bordering counties. The UK and Ireland would contribute additional new money, worth 25 per cent of the new EU funds spent within their territory, for a total potential package of Ecu625m. Britain, which has clashed with the Commission in the past about the normal legal requirement to 'match' EU aid with 'additional', or genuinely new money, says there will be no repackaging of already committed funding for the province. Mr John Major, British prime minister, gave a public commitment in Belfast late last month that the UK would put in new funding to match extra EU grants. The EU has already committed Ecu1.23bn to Northern Ireland in 1994-99, under the structural funds aid programme, as well as Ecu20m a year to the multinational International Fund for Ireland.

Talks between the political parties in the province are not expected to resume before the autumn because of slow progress by the British and Irish governments in drafting the framework document, which is intended to provide a focus for the talks. The governments had hoped to publish the document to coincide with a planned bilateral summit next month, but following a meeting of the UK-Irish inter-governmental conference in Dublin yesterday, Mr Spring admitted it would be 'difficult to meet that timetable'. Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, said the framework document, which will flesh out the principles established in December's Dowing Street declaration, would not be 'a blueprint or template' to which the parties would have to conform. But he stressed that it would have to address modification of the Republic's territorial claim to Northern Ireland 'if it is to have any chance of success' in bringing unionists to the negotiating table. 'It is central to the problem,' said Sir Patrick. Mr Spring said: 'There has to be compromise on both sides, by both governments.' Modification of the territorial claim would be in the context of a 'balanced accommodation' which would also involve modifications to the Government of Ireland Act of 1920. He referred specifically to Section 75 of the act, which states: 'The supreme authority of the parliament of the United Kingdom shall remain unaffected and undiminished over all persons and things in (Northern) Ireland and every part thereof.' Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, has indicated that it intends to give its 'definitive response' to the Downing Street declaration early next month - but is not now expected to recommend an end to the IRA campaign.

The Labour party, which was opposed to re-opening the controversial issue, accused the government of doing a secret deal with the Ulster unionists, who have long favoured the setting up of a select committee to scrutinise the work of the Northern Ireland Office. Sir Peter Emery, Tory chairman of the procedure committee, made clear his support for a select committee urging the government 'to look at our report and act on it'. The report, first drafted in 1990, supported the establishment of a Northern Ireland select committee at the appropriate time. Mr Tony Banks, a Labour member of the procedure committee, said the Conservatives wanted a Northern Ireland select committee as part of their 'pay-off' to the Ulster unionists who helped the government avoid a Commons defeat in a confidence debate on the Maastricht treaty earlier this year. The Irish government is dismayed by the possibility that the British parliament might set up such a committee. Meanwhile, Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, stressed that there was 'no question of simply adopting or endorsing the report of the Hume-Adams dialogue'. His comments yesterday are likely to be welcomed by Downing Street. The UK government has continued to distance itself from the peace proposals put forward by Mr John Hume, leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party, and Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the political arm of the IRA. Mr Reynolds praised Mr Hume for his efforts to start a peace process, but said it needed a wider base. The prospects of the Hume-Adams plan being accepted by the UK government further receded yesterday after Mr Adams helped to carry the coffin of Thomas Begley, the IRA bomber who died in the Shankill Road fish shop blast at the weekend. Unionists and Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, attacked Mr Adams's action. Mr Hume yesterday defended his talks with Mr Adams, saying that he had taken a risk in difficult circumstances. Although the Hume-Adams proposals for peace will be discussed tomorrow at a meeting between Mr Reynolds and Mr John Major, the prime minister, both governments now appear to be more interested in reviving the stalled 'three-strand' talks under the auspices of Sir Patrick. A soldier was charged last night with the attempted murder of Mr Eddie Copeland, a leading Republican, outside Mr Begley's home. Mr Copeland was among mourners outside the Begley home in the Republican Ardoyne area of Belfast when he was hit in the stomach by a bullet.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

0,FT942-5855 ,"FT942-5855 _AN-EFBDVAEXFT 940602   FT  02 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Cost cuts help NIE to Pounds 75m - Some 510 staff leave core business, further reductions planned      By MICHAEL SMITH   Job cuts and above average sales growth helped Northern Ireland Electricity, which was privatised last June, to increase annual pre-tax profits by 28 per cent, from Pounds 58.7m to Pounds 74.9m. The comparative figures are on a pro forma basis. NIE cut 510 staff from its core business in the 12 months to March 31, leaving 2,756 in place. It plans to lose at least another 200 by March 1996. The jobs cuts were one of the factors behind a 5 per cent reduction in controllable costs during the year. The company also benefited from a 2.4 per cent growth in unit sales for the year, compared with an average of 1.1 per cent achieved by power distributors in Great Britain. Operating profit increased to Pounds 81.9m (Pounds 72.3m) on turnover of Pounds 482m (Pounds 453m). The pre-tax line, however, was depressed by an Pounds 8.2m exceptional item for reorganisation and restructuring costs mainly incurred in reducing staff. Earnings per share were ahead 32 per cent at 36.7p (27.8p). A proposed final dividend of 8p gives a total of 11.39p. Sir Desmond Lorimer, outgoing chairman, said the company had told the industry regulator that it favoured the introduction of competition into the market. The regulator has already tabled proposals for the creation of a pool trading system. Sir Desmond said NIE had 'highlighted the need to avoid structures which are uneconomic or which might compromise stability'. COMMENT The pattern is familiar enough. A recently privatised company finds the scope for cutting costs is far greater than it had imagined when it was negotiating with the government on setting the price for the sale. It happened when the power industry in England and Wales was privatised four years ago and it has happened again with NIE. Consumers and taxpayers will no doubt complain, but shareholders need not worry too much. They can rejoice that, unlike the England and Wales power companies, NIE will escape major regulatory reform this summer. They should also congratulate the management whose control on job numbers and capital expenditure should ensure that gearing will reach nothing like the 60 per cent levels once predicted for the late 1990s; even 40 per cent may seem excessive now. With dividend cover last year at 3.2 times, there is plenty of scope to increase the distribution to shareholders. This year could see about 13p, putting the shares on a prospective yield on a fully paid basis of 4.6 per cent, nearly a percentage point lower than the England and Wales power companies. Nonetheless, the shares have been strongly outperforming recently. In the short term their progress will be arrested as the June 28 deadline approaches for paying the second instalment for the shares.   Companies:-  Northern Ireland Electricity.

Mr Michael Ancram, the Northern Ireland minister responsible for conducting talks with the province's main parties, is to resume immediately the series of bilateral discussions aimed at seeking agreement on the shape of a political settlement in the province. In Dublin Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, is expected to announce today the opening of formal talks with Irish opposition leaders on the setting up of the proposed Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, first mentioned in the Downing Street declaration as a way of promoting cross-border relationships. The message from both governments will be that Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, will be able to participate in both exercises only when the republican movement decides on a permanent cessation of violence. Since the end of the IRA ceasefire on Friday, the province has again been hit by terrorist attacks from the IRA as well as from loyalist groups. In spite of Ulster politicians' intense public criticism of the so-called three-stranded talks process and the prospect of slow progress at least until after the European elections in June, the Northern Ireland Office intends to press on with the internal dialogue and with efforts to agree with Dublin a more detailed framework for political progress. Until now Mr Reynolds has resisted opposition calls to establish the forum, preferring to wait for a response from Sinn Fein to the Downing Street declaration. In December Mr Reynolds said the purpose of the forum would be to bring Sinn Fein into an initial negotiating process with nationalist parties following a permanent cessation of IRA violence. Dublin's thinking now is to leave an empty seat for Sinn Fein pending an end to IRA violence. Mr John Bruton, the leader of Ireland's opposition Fine Gael party, said yesterday that the peace process now required 'more practical and more immediate' measures including talks between Northern Ireland's political parties on a Bill of Rights for the province.

In a debate at the Conservative conference in Bournemouth coinciding with yesterday's ceasefire announcement Mr Mayhew made a forthright defence of the province's right to self-determination. But, watched by prime minister Mr John Major, he stopped just short of embracing grassroots calls for the government actively to persuade Ulster's people that their best future lies in the United Kingdom. Sir Patrick said: 'One undoubted fact in Northern Ireland is that most people living there want to stay within the union. That is where they think their best interests lie. And I say without hesitation we are glad of it. 'We are persuaders for the future of Northern Ireland to be decided among the people of Northern Ireland, themselves, freely and without external impediment,' he said. The 'delicacy of balance' had to be maintained if 'this province of the United Kingdom' was to achieve a less antagonistic way of life. Welcoming the loyalist ceasefire, Sir Patrick said the government would test that the 'intention of permanence' was genuine 'as we have tested the intent and sincerity of the IRA'. He added: 'If we can confirm to our satisfaction that the intention is permanent then we will explore with them the ways that the peace process can be strengthened and their views taken into account.' He made clear that the government was still not quite satisfied that the IRA had ended its campaign of violence for good. What mattered, he said, was the need to be sure they would not revert to violence rather than 'the precise language in which their intention is expressed'. Sir Patrick honoured the fortitude of the people of Northern Ireland in the face of terrorism, republican and loyalist. He condemned the terrorists' 'sickening, random crimes' and said of the horrific aftermath of outrages: 'The blood congeals and lies like pools of black treacle on the floor.' Sir Patrick and Mr Major were greeted enthusiastically by representatives in spite of the leadership's decision not to allow a vote on an amendment urging the government to be a persuader for the union. Mr Leonard Fee, chairman of the Conservative Northern Ireland Area Council and the senior unpaid Tory in the province, said 1,100 people had signed a petition urging the amendment to be called. He said: 'If we start down the devolution slope I believe within a fairly short period of time our nation will be in tatters.' Ms Dorothy Dunlop, a former Belfast city councillor, implicitly criticised Baroness Thatcher, the former prime minister, by saying that the government should have called a referendum after signing the Anglo-Irish Agreement in 1985. 'If we had had a referendum then, we would have been spared much of the loyalist violence whose end we are celebrating today,' she said. She believed Mr Major would not have entered into the agreement had he been prime minister in 1985.   Countries:-  IEZ  Ireland, EC.     GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, said he was determined not to allow the process to be derailed by the killings in a bar in Greysteel, Co Derry. The initiative was rejected by Mr Peter Robinson, deputy leader of the hardline Democratic Unionist party, who warned that Northern Ireland was close to civil war. Terrorists from both sides have killed 23 people in the last two weeks in a cycle of violence triggered by last weekend's bombing of a shop in Belfast which killed 10 people. The violence continued yesterday when an RUC officer was wounded in Newry. Mr Reynolds said Unionists had 'nothing to fear' from the initiative launched by the British and Irish governments in Brussels on Friday. He said: 'As long as a majority of the people of Northern Ireland wish the present status to remain, that's the way it will be.' Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, said he hoped to set up a series of meetings with Unionist leaders, probably lasting up to 12 months. But Mr Robinson said the joint statement issued by the two prime ministers was 'an endorsement of the six-point plan for a united Ireland laid out last week by Dick Spring. 'Whoever it was aimed at, it was not aimed at Unionists because it is adopting a nationalist agenda.' However, ministers were heartened by the restrained reaction of Mr James Molyneaux, leader of the official Ulster Unionist party (UUP), who has made no public comment. The British government believes that constitutional guarantees and changes to parliamnetary procedures for Northern Ireland legislation may persuade Mr Molyneaux to take part in the talks. The government is moving to set up a Commons committee on Ulster, and may also scrap the use of non-amendable orders in council for Northern Ireland legislation. However, other UUP leaders remained wary. Mr David Trimble, the party's home affairs spokesman, said Mr Spring was guilty of 'self-deception.' Mr John Major is expected to make a statement on the peace initiative in the Commons today, probably as part of a wider report on the EC summit in Brussels. The prime minister is expected to distance the Anglo-Irish initiative from the peace proposals produced by Mr John Hume, leader of the nationalist SDLP, and Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA. Mr Hume said in a series of interviews that the SDLP/Sinn Fein proposals remained the best prospect for peace in Northern Ireland. He said it was 'difficult to accept' that the Hume-Adams proposals had been dismissed by the British and Irish governments. Mr Hume accused Mr Major of being unwilling to discuss the proposals. However, he said he would drop the proposals if he was convinced that he had become an obstacle to peace. 'If the prime minister tells me that he has a peace process with the Irish government that is going to produce a total cessation of violence, and he convinces me that my dialogue is stopping that, then obviously I am not going to be an obstacle to that,' he said. Downing Street said Mr Hume had not requested a meeting with Mr Major. However, the prime minister is willing to meet party leaders, including Mr Hume, at any time. The British government is determined not to be seen to be talking to the IRA through Mr Hume. Background, Page 7   Countries:-  IEZ  Ireland, EC.     GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

In a scarcely disguised rebuke, Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, said he had been 'surprised' by comments made in a newspaper interview by Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister. Speaking after a meeting of the Anglo-Irish conference, Sir Patrick said Mr Spring had apparently gone beyond the 'cardinal principle' that the constitutional future of Northern Ireland would have to be agreed across the two communities in the province. But Mr Spring said that it would be wrong for any option for Northern Ireland to be ruled out: 'If we are not allowed to put forward provocative ideas then we may as well all give up.' He added that if 'round-table' talks on the province's future failed, then 'ultimately responsibility lies with governments and I think that the governments have to make that quite clear'. The row reflected growing frustration in London and Dublin at the failure of the two governments to restart the talks involving Northern Ireland's main political leaders that collapsed last November. Unionists say that they will not re-enter until the Irish Republic modifies its constitutional claim on the north. Sir Patrick again refused to give up yesterday, saying: 'I don't visualise this process failing and I'm certainly not planning for it failing or a course of action if it does.' However, Mr Spring has raised the possibility of the two governments going over the heads of local politicians and agreeing a new political framework for the province, possibility being put to referenda in north and south Ireland. Options could include joint authority or sovereignty of the province. But Mr John Major, the prime minister, and Sir Patrick have firmly rejected such proposals and yesterday Mr James Molyneaux, leader of the Ulster Unionist party, said Mr Spring's comments amounted to an 'incitement to take the paramilitary road'. Sir Patrick and Mr Spring also clashed over the exclusion order served on Mr John Matthews, who was cleared in court of an attempted bomb attack on Downing Street. In spite of attempts by Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, to defend the order, Mr Spring said he believed Britain should review the powers it has under the 1974 Prevention of Terrorism Act.

Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, and Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, used separate speeches to encourage support for the joint statement agreed last month. Republican leaders are insisting on clarification before making up their minds on whether to embrace the peace process. Their demand has been repeatedly rejected by London as an attempt to secure further concessions - a stance reiterated by Sir Patrick yesterday afternoon when he told MPs there was no justification for clarifying the joint statement. An apparent stalemate has resulted, with London vowing to intensify political talks with Ulster's constitutional parties, aimed at restoring devolved government to the province. In last night's speech, Sir Patrick balanced a passage offering reassurance to nationalists with a strong affirmation of the unionist veto over any constitutional change in the province's status. In his message to nationalists, Sir Patrick said the government would do 'everything in our power' to facilitate agreement. Emphasising that 'no outcome is ruled out', Sir Patrick said the key was 'agreement between the people living in the island of Ireland, north and south'. He set out the ground that would be covered in exploratory dialogue between London and Sinn Fein that would begin within three months of the IRA renouncing violence, saying: 'That is where clarification could be appropriate.' He told unionists the government would uphold the democratic wish of 'a greater number of the people of Northern Ireland' on whether they prefer to support the union or a sovereign united Ireland. Mr Reynolds sought to clarify Dublin's position on self-determination, saying it was vital that doubts or confusions about the document should be cleared up. He said the island of Ireland and 'not just Northern Ireland' made up 'the framework for self-determination'. There were 'no short cuts' to the need for majority consent to change in Northern Ireland. Those wanting unification 'should persuade those that do not'. The end result of self-determination was not necessarily unification, but rather 'any comprehensive settlement that would constitute an agreed Ireland'. In West Belfast, Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams hinted to party workers that if the right signals flowed from the declaration an IRA ceasefire could not be ruled out. 'There is still the opportunity for peace and Sinn Fein is committed to ensuring the British government does not squander that opportunity,' Mr Adams said.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

But a significant event occurred this weekend which will resonate well beyond the parochial confines of the Belfast or Londonderry City Halls or the corridors of the Northern Ireland Office at Stormont. For Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Provisional IRA - which has been waging a terrorist campaign to effect the withdrawal of Britain from the province - has now formally entered a process of negotiation to put an end to the violence. On Saturday evening Mr John Hume, the leader of the Social Democratic Labour party, and Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein leader, jointly announced that they are submitting a report to the Irish government on the progress of their bilateral talks which have been taking place during the past six months. It is intended that the report will be discussed in Dublin and in London. Mr John Major, the British prime minister, was apparently told two weeks ago that such a development was imminent when he met Mr Hume in Downing Street on September 16. Since starting his bilateral talks with Mr Adams, Mr Hume has emphasised that they are not aimed at achieving a simple ceasefire but are aimed at bringing about 'a total cessation of all violence'. Politics in Northern Ireland entered a vacuum in November last year when a series of round-table talks between the main political parties, initiated in 1991 by Mr Peter Brooke, the former Northern Ireland Secretary, broke up without an agreement. Those talks were overseen by the British and Irish governments under the auspices of the 1985 Anglo-Irish agreement, and were designed to produce a replacement for the 1985 agreement and a new constitutional framework for the province. Unionist insistence that the Irish Republic must first drop its territorial claim to Northern Ireland as a basis for continued negotiation was a significant obstacle to progress. Sinn Fein was excluded from the talks because of its tacit support for the IRA, and both governments have refused to negotiate with the party until such time as either Sinn Fein renounces the IRA, or the IRA itself decides to end its military campaign. Frustrated with the failure of the round-table talks, Mr Hume then decided to take a totally different tack. Although the target of much invective and attacks from the Unionists for embarking upon his negotiation with Mr Adams, it is significant that neither the Irish nor British governments have criticised him for doing so. It is still too early to say that a breakthrough has been achieved in the Northern Ireland logjam. as Immensely delicate and careful negotiations remain to be carried out, not least to convince the Unionist parties that there might be some merit in the SDLP-Sinn Fein proposals. But it is highly significant that Mr Hume is today in the US briefing US Congressional leaders about his proposals. As an SDLP spokesman said in Belfast: 'It is not likely that either the British or Irish governments will talk to Sinn Fein yet, until there is an end to the violence. But that does not mean they will not talk through an intermediary.'   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.     IEZ  Ireland, EC.   Industries:-  P9721 International Affairs.

Yesterday's meeting was the first between the two governments since November, when it was agreed to suspend further efforts to renew the political talks process in Northern Ireland until after the general elections in the Republic. Mr Spring and Sir Patrick said their first meeting had been 'very worthwhile and satisfactory' and that they had covered all the main areas necessary 'to get the talks process working well and to bring it to a successful conclusion'. It is expected that at least two Anglo-Irish conference meetings will be necessary to prepare the way for a renewed series of talks involving the Northern Ireland political parties. The previous 'three-strand' talks ended inconclusively last year, with the two Unionist parties accusing Dublin of having been too inflexible over the Republic's territorial claim to the province.

Speaking as a European Union report concluded that Roman Catholics in the province were more than twice as likely to be out of work as Protestants, Sir James Kilfedder, the committee's chairman, said the choice reflected the deep concern about jobs felt by MPs on the committee. Sir James, the Ulster Popular Unionist party MP for North Down, said the inquiry would take in issues related to inward investment. In the course of the inquiry the committee - which intends to make a symbolic first visit to Ulster within four weeks - would have to meet in Northern Ireland 'from time to time'. The announcement came on the eve of the first meeting of a joint council of the Confederation of British Industry and the Irish Business and Employers Confederation under an initiative to boost trade between the province and the Irish Republic. Mr Howard Davies, CBI director-general, said the joint council had set itself the target of doubling north-south trade - now estimated at Pounds 1.5bn - over the next five years. At a dinner in Belfast last night, Mr Davies said there was 'no reason' why the target should not be achieved - 'particularly if we see further steps towards a cessation of violence and a political settlement'. Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, who is just back from a trip to the US and Canada, said there was 'a definitely favourable bias in the US towards investment in Northern Ireland - notwithstanding our media image that we here are running a Clint Eastwood scenario 24 hours a day'. Yesterday's EU report said there had been no 'substantial improvement' in employment prospects for Catholics over the past 20 years - in spite of anti-discrimination measures introduced by British governments. Catholics suffered most from long-term unemployment and were under-represented in many top-ranking executive posts. The report, which is due to be considered by MEPs tomorrow, calls on the European Commission to investigate labour market discrimination in Ulster. Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, yesterday called for greater security to protect Northern Ireland's nationalist community from attacks by loyalist gunmen.

'There is always a bias towards a national supplier,' he said. Mr Rifkind, answering questions after a speech on the defence programme to the Royal United Services Institute in London, said it was important for Britain to have an industry that could 'manufacture as much as possible' to meet the country's military needs. His remarks contrasted with the strong emphasis placed on international competition for defence orders during Sir Peter Levene's period as chief of defence procurement from 1985 to 1991. Defence equipment remains outside the scope of the European single market. Mr Rifkind said the Ministry of Defence, with a Pounds 9bn annual procurement budget, was by far the largest single client British industry had or was ever likely to have. UK arms manufacturers had also, with MoD support, cornered 20 per cent of the world market last year, more than any other country except the US. 'I can't think of any other part of our industry which has a performance remotely comparable to that,' he said. Mr Rifkind also took issue with his former armed forces minister, Mr Archie Hamilton, who argued at the weekend for a reduction in the number of troops in Northern Ireland. Mr Rifkind promised that the government would provide 'whatever is needed' to support the Royal Ulster Constabulary and that Northern Ireland would take priority over other missions such as UN deployments. There are more than 19,100 soldiers in the province, including the locally recruited Royal Irish Regiment. Meanwhile, officials disclosed that the British army might move part of its training to North Africa because of the loss of its main training area in Germany and pressure from environmentalist lobbies in the UK.

0,FT923-13542 ,"FT923-13542 _AN-CGMA3ACQFT 920713   FT  13 JUL 92 / Ulster weighs its balancing act: The recurring charges of human rights abuse      By RALPH ATKINS   AMNESTY International, the human rights organisation, last week again documented lengthy allegations of abuse in Northern Ireland. It is a perennial charge against the UK government which has to tackle, in the IRA and loyalist paramilitaries, some of the world's most experienced terrorists. This year, though, there is perhaps more reason to suggest that tougher measures to prevent abuse may be implemented. All the Northern Ireland parties taking part in 'round-table' talks on the province's future support a bill of rights, or incorporation of the European convention on human rights into UK law. Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, has said he would not oppose such a move. If the talks collapse, it is one element that might be salvaged. Allegations of the sort listed by Amnesty International are common in the republican heartlands and Roman Catholic-dominated towns of Northern Ireland. But unionists are also worried about possible abuse. Few argue that abuse is avoidable in an undeclared war against paramilitaries. The worst atrocities are committed by terrorists; ministers' prime concern has to be preserving the right to life of the province's population. It is a difficult balance, but the security forces are often distrusted by the minority nationalist population - and sometimes by unionists as well. There is a widespread perception that checks on the security forces are inadequate. 'There is no law here,' says Father Denis Faul, principal of St Patrick's Academy in Dungannon, County Tyrone, and persistent campaigner for human rights. 'The British give us money for leisure centres, they give us the small liberties but they will keep all the big ones. They are a bit inclined to be bullies.' Allegations of human rights abuse lowers Britain's esteem abroad, adding to Northern Ireland's grim image in the eyes of possible investors. 'In Northern Ireland you have much greater pressure on human rights but the pressure takes place in the part of Europe which has the least safeguards,' says Mr Colm Campbell, chairman of the Belfast-based Committee on the Administration of Justice. Particular anxiety has arisen in the past year over the treatment of suspects at the RUC's Castlereagh holding centre in Belfast. The Northern Ireland emergency provisions acts allow suspects to be held for up to seven days without being charged. Access to a solicitor can be delayed for 48 hours after arrest. Amnesty International last week detailed allegations of confessions obtained under duress and of physical intimidation of suspects. Last year it complained to the United Nations' Committee against Torture. The RUC says there is no policy of abusing prisoners and its investigations rarely find conclusive evidence to substantiate the allegations. An independent commissioner for holding centres is to be appointed but complaints will continue to be investigated by the RUC itself - either under the supervision of the new commissioner or the existing Northern Ireland Independent Commission for Police Complaints. Lack of adequate safeguards is a recurrent theme of the Standing Advisory Committee on Human Rights (SACHR) - an independent body set up by the government in 1973. Sir Oliver Napier, who stood down as chairman of the SACHR at the end of last month, says the government is extremely slow to accept its recommendations. The Northern Ireland Office argues that it strikes the right balance between tackling terrorism and protecting human rights. But, as has become apparent during the inter-party talks, unionists and nationalists accept that a formal mechanism for ensuring a proper balance may be needed.

The crushing defeat of the Tories at the Christchurch by-election on Thursday, leaving them with a majority of just 17, and continuing threats of rebellion on the Tory backbenches have given Mr James Molyneaux, the UUP leader, the opportunity he has long been looking for. He now hopes to drive a wedge between London and Dublin and to reverse what Unionists perceive to be the growing influence of the Republic of Ireland in Northern Ireland's affairs. In return for the support of his nine MPs, Mr Molyneaux said last week that he had reached an 'understanding' with Mr Major. The government has repeatedly denied that a deal was struck. Mr Ken Maginnis, the UUP deputy leader, said 'there has not been any last-minute deal signed up in legal terms'. Talks had being going on for months 'resulting from government frustration with the Northern Ireland round-table talks process and the intransigence of the Irish government and the (nationalist) SDLP'. He added: 'The government has for some time been indicating a willingness, if all else fails, to consider changes in the way Northern Ireland is to be governed.' Some of the changes envisaged by the UUP include the establishment of a Northern Ireland select committee at Westminster, the broadening of local government powers in the province and 'greater attention being paid to persons with experience in security issues'. Asked whether these changes would signify the abandonment of the Anglo-Irish Agreement Mr Maginnis said: 'I certainly hope so.' Mr Molyneaux said last week he expects the agreement 'to wither away'. This has set alarm bells jangling in Dublin. Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, said last week he would be 'very concerned' by any unilateral moves made by the British government on Northern Ireland. One of his aides said: 'If a clear warning is made to London that any unilateral move would be viewed as undermining the Anglo-Irish Agreement, but they go ahead and do it anyway, then one can only conclude that this would lead to a major crisis in Anglo-Irish relations'. The fact that Mr Reynolds has stepped into the fray, not leaving it solely to Mr Dick Spring, his foreign minister, is indicative of the seriousness with which the issue is being dealt with in Dublin. In Belfast the SDLP, led by Mr John Hume, said: 'This is an integrationist move, making Northern Ireland similar to Scotland or Wales and ignores the fact that we have a divided community here, where a large part of the population consider themselves Irish.' Hitherto, the British government has professed neutrality in the Anglo-Irish talks process. A key phrase used by Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, and first coined by Mr Peter Brooke, his predecessor, was that Britain had 'no strategic interest' in Northern Ireland - a phrase which alarmed Unionists but encouraged nationalists to believe that Downing Street was genuinely exploring a neutral approach. Mr Hume has been involved in bilateral talks with Mr Gerry Adams, the leader of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA. The talks have angered Unionists but Mr Hume says they are aimed at bringing the political violence to an end. Unionists accuse Mr Hume, Sinn Fein and Dublin of trying to set up a 'pan-nationalist front'. Although there has been discomfiture in Dublin at Mr Hume's move, the official government reaction is that 'Mr Hume is an experienced politician and knows what he is doing'. According to those close to the Hume-Adams talks, one of Mr Hume's main arguments has been that the British government's professed neutrality in the round-table talks and its statement of 'no strategic interest' in the province, provide the basis for a negotiated end to the political violence. Significantly, Sinn Fein has substantially moderated its tone over recent months, and although it still argues that Britain must go one step further and make a commitment to militarily and politically disengage from Northern Ireland, it sets no deadline for this as it has in the past and has been making increasingly conciliatory statements directed towards the Unionists. Mr Hume's key argument now looks very shaky however, and with it his hopes of ending the IRA bombing campaign and eventually bringing Sinn Fein into the peace process. In private, the republic's officials now talk about playing the US card  - asking the Clinton administration to appoint a 'peace envoy' to Northern Ireland. British objections have until now restrained Dublin from pushing this option. A further option might be for the republic to ease its 22-year broadcasting ban on Sinn Fein. This would increase pressure for a review of the similar ban in the UK.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P9199 General Government, NEC.   Types:-  GOVT  Government News.

Unionist and nationalist leaders are expected to be presented with alternative suggestions for the venue of negotiations involving the Irish government. If agreement cannot be reached, Mr Brooke will have to decide whether it is worth continuing the talks. Mr Brooke is believed to have discussed possible fall-back positions with Mr Gerry Collins, Irish foreign minister, at a four-hour meeting in London on Friday. He has taken gambles before in his talks initiative; successfully bringing Northern Ireland's constitutional parties together with a 'take it or leave it' offer before Easter. This time, the Northern Ireland Office appears to be hoping that, after a weekend of reflection by the parties involved and the threat of an embarrassingly early collapse of the talks, there will be sufficient movement today for a compromise to be reached. But Mr Brooke knows there will seem little point in continuing to debate a logistical detail indefinitely. Failure to reach a compromise on this issue suggests the goodwill believed to exist before talks started had been exaggerated vastly. Already two weeks have passed, out of the 11 set aside for round-table talks. Mr James Molyneaux and the Rev Ian Paisley, leaders of the Unionist parties, again insisted at the weekend that they would not hold talks with Dublin ministers anywhere in Ireland while the Republic's territorial claim to Northern Ireland remained. The nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party believes that meetings should rotate between London, Dublin and Belfast. Constructing defences, Page 9  The Financial Times   London Page 24  "

The Northern Ireland Economic Council says in its annual report that unemployment in Ulster, at just over 14 per cent, is lower than a year ago. But it is still substantially higher than the UK average of 10.4 per cent. Output per head is only 77 per cent of the UK average, it adds. Far-reaching structural adjustment would be required to close the gap in living standards between the province and the rest of the UK, it says. Although the economy has performed comparatively well over the last year relative to the UK, unprecedented growth rates would be needed to bring it up to mainland UK standards within the next decade. To help eradicate structural weakness in the economy, the council recommends increasing industrial research and development undertaken local-ly and improving the proficiency of the local workforce. It says that long-term unemployment is the most severe manifestation of weakness, and suggests that resolving the problem should be at the forefront of decisions on how to spend structural funds from the European Community. The council recommends that reducing long-term unemployment should form the basis for the community support framework for 1994-99, which states how EC structural funds are to be spent.

Mr Adams told a St Patrick's Day rally that the US Administration was displaying readiness to take a fresh approach to the conflict in spite of sustained British pressure. Mr Adams was speaking before yesterday's meeting in the US between Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, and Mr Bill Clinton, the US president. The Sinn Fein leader said republicans wanted to live in peace and without coercion among their unionist neighbours. He said Sinn Fein neither condoned nor encouraged armed actions and stressed that all parties had to be involved in the current peace process. Mr Adams's stance received a guarded welcome in Washington, with Mr Clinton saying he was 'quite encouraged' that the IRA remained interested in the peace process. Mr Adams's words came 'at a good time', and Mr Clinton added: 'I hope it has a good effect.' Standing with Mr Reynolds at a White House ceremony to mark St Patrick's Day, Mr Clinton said it was 'premature' to discuss the question of issuing another US visa to the Sinn Fein leader. He had no regrets about letting Mr Adams into the US last month - 'because we all have to take a chance for peace' - but indicated that much would depend on what Mr Adams's party did next. 'The issue now is what is going to be the role of Sinn Fein in the ongoing peace effort,' he explained. 'Will they join? I hope they will.' Speaking later at a St Patrick's Day dinner hosted by the president, Mr Reynolds said that US support for the Northern Ireland peace process would have 'an important influence' on its outcome.' He said that the Downing Street declaration had created a 'historic opportunity' to resolve the Northern Ireland conflict and had 'removed any possible justification for violence'. He had earlier briefed Mr Clinton on the latest developments in the peace process and he was in turn briefed by Mr Clinton on the recent visit to the US by Mr John Major, the prime minister. In London, Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, was urged strongly by Tory backbenchers to increase pressure on the Irish government to improve security co-operation. Many Conservative backbenchers are anxious for security co-operation to be improved in areas such as intelligence gathering and the cross-border pursuit of terrorist suspects. These matters are understood to have been raised by officers of the Tory backbench Northern Ireland committee in a short meeting with the Northern Ireland secretary after question-time in the House of Commons. Earlier, Sir Patrick told MPs that the recent IRA mortar attacks at Heathrow Airport would not wreck the peace process. He said: 'If Sinn Fein or the Provisional IRA consider that they are going by violence to secure a departure from the declaration or any concession from the British government, they would be better employed taking a running jump at themselves.'

In  their joint Anglo-Irish declaration, launched two months ago,  they held out the explicit possibility of eventual unification  of the two halves of Ireland, if that was what the people of  Ireland wanted. But the essential precondition for setting this  initiative in motion was that the IRA terrorists must first  declare a ceasefire.    That precondition has not been met. The IRA has not rejected  the offer, but the fact that it has not stopped the bombing and  shooting suggests that a permanent ceasefire is not very likely.  The UK and Irish prime ministers meet next week to see where  they go from here; it looks as though they need to think again.    The rationale for the December declaration was a belief that  the IRA was tired out after 25 years of fruitless terrorism, and  might give up. Yet even if the terrorists are tired it requires  great faith to conclude that they can now be converted to  democracy. And even if most of the terrorists were prepared to  give up, Whitehall officials seem to fear that they may be held  hostage by the out-and- out extremists.    If the IRA does not agree to give up terrorism, the two  governments must rethink their initiative from top to bottom.  Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, has said  Britain will press ahead with new moves, including devolved  local government in the province; perhaps it may. But a  political process that leaves out the hard republicans, and  perhaps the hard unionists will be a meagre affair beside the  comprehensive agenda of the December declaration.    Yet the strategic position may be less bleak than it looks  because various parts of the truth are now being made plain.  First, the declaration gives explicit recognition not just to  the undeniable old fact, that Northern Ireland is historically  and geographically part of Ireland, but also to the new  political fact, that its future will be decided not in London  but in Ireland. In the introduction to the declaration, the two  governments say their aim is a ""new political framework founded  on consent,"" and a purely British passage says ""it is for the  people of Ireland alone, by agreement between the two parts  respectively, to exercise their right of self-determination, on  the basis of consent, if that is their wish."" Neither passage  can give any comfort to rightwing nationalists at Westminster,  let alone to die-hard unionists among Northern Irish Protestants.    Such an explicit recognition by the UK of the legitimacy of  the claims of Irish unity (though only by consent) is  unprecedented. But the corollary of the principle of consent is  that terrorism, so far from advancing the cause of Irish unity,  makes it impossible. The very premise of terrorism is a denial  of democracy, the total negation of consent. In Northern  Ireland, the two communities are too evenly balanced to admit of  a victory of one over the other. IRA terrorism cannot lead to a  political victory for the nationalists, because the immediate  consequence would be more terrorism by extremist Protestants,  most probably a civil war.    If the leaders of the IRA were to take up the offer of  ""reconciliation, leading to a new political framework,"" that  would be wonderful; but it may be too much of a miracle to hope  for. If they do not, then the IRA and Sinn Fein will both be  politically dead meat. If they reject the opportunities offered  by the declaration, they will have forfeited their claim to  speak for the people of Ireland; and they will have shown that  terrorism takes precedence over politics, and that Sinn Fein is  ruled by the IRA, not the other way round.    But whether the IRA says yes or no, the central problem in  the declaration is with the definition of the concept of  consent. The reason for the terrorism by Catholics and  Protestants is that consent is lacking; and even if the  terrorism stopped, consent would still be lacking. In fact,  there is never likely to be, in our lifetimes, the kind of  political majority, either for keeping or for changing the  constitutional status quo, which could be counted on to produce  a permanent and peaceful settlement of the Northern Ireland  question.    The corollary is that the medium-term future of Northern  Ireland will be decided not by local parties or local  majorities, but by agreement between the governments of Britain  and Ireland. Sir Patrick Mayhew professes to rule out any idea  of joint authority over Northern Ireland; but in strategic  terms, that is precisely what is implied by the Anglo-Irish  declaration. When the two governments say their aim is ""a new  political framework, within Northern Ireland, for the whole  island, and between these islands,"" they are talking about  shared authority, almost a de facto condominium.    One detailed study has argued for a ""de jure condominium,""  through an Anglo-Irish treaty. This would be an extraordinary  innovation in constitutional practice, and would have  difficulties with the old-timers in the House of Commons. But  it would make logical sense, because it would rule out, for  ever, the only grounds for terrorism: the hope of total victory  by one community at the expense of the other. And it could also  make a creative political contribution to the development of  interstate relationships in the context of the European Union.    But if London dare not admit the reality of condominium, at  least let us have no more talk of self-determination. We have  seen what it has achieved in former Yugoslavia, and we do not  need that kind of self-determination in Northern Ireland.     "

Amid signs that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, will announce big cuts in public spending in his November Budget, the Treasury is understood to have conducted an intense examination of the spending programmes of each of the three territorial departments. But senior officials at the departments said this week that they expected their grants would be upgraded in line with inflation and that few individual programmes would be scaled back. 'We now know that our grant will not be radically different,' said a Scottish Office official, confirming that the department had strongly resisted changes to a basic formula by which it receives an allocation which is a proportion of relevant spending in England. An official at the Northern Ireland Office also claimed that Mr Jonathan Aitken, the chief secretary to the Treasury, was unlikely to press ahead with cuts in the department's budget during delicate negotiations over a political settlement in the province. 'We reckon that Jonathan Aitken is very astute, and would recognise the problems if the Treasury goes in too strong here and cuts areas that are politically sensitive,' he said. In the annual public spending round, total provision for each of the three territorial departments is adjusted in line with the size of comparable programmes in England, such as education, housing and health. The population of each territory is also taken into account. Last year, Scotland received 10.66 per cent of England's grant, Wales 6.02 per cent and Northern Ireland 2.87 per cent. As in previous years, Treasury officials are understood to have called for changes in these percentages, but appear to have failed. 'The formula arrangements as they apply to Scotland will continue,' said one official, adding that it would be prone to marginal adjustments because of population change. Officials at the Northern Ireland office said this week that the Treasury had again tried to run all three departments on a straight per capita basis, ignoring the special circumstances created by the security situation in Ulster. It is understood that the cost of maintaining Northern Ireland's prisons and paying compensation to victims of terrorist attacks have been regularly examined in talks between the department and the Treasury.

However, Mr Major may find himself preaching to the converted. Many delegates will represent companies which have already invested in the province. The Industrial Development Board for Northern Ireland, which is organising the conference, has declared itself, 'well pleased' with the response to invitations. It says that so far more than 260 delegates have agreed to attend. By last night fewer than 12 corporate executives from the US had agreed to attend - although Mr Ron Brown, the US Commerce Secretary, and four congressmen are to go. The executives include Mr John Stafford, chairman of American Home Products; Mr Ronald Evans, president of Best Western International, Mr Patrick Keough, president of Computronics Distributors, Mr James McCann, president of 800-Flowers; Mr William Flynn, chairman of Mutual of American Life Insurance Company, Ms Susan Morrice, manager of S. Morrice  Associates, Mr James Malloy, chairman of Smurfit Packaging Corporation, and Mr George David, president of United Technologies. Mr Evans is joining the mission in hopes of getting more affiliate hotels. The company's enthusiasm for Northern Ireland springs from its experience in the Irish Republic, where it found 'a wealth of young multilingual talent' and the best telecommunications infrastructure in Europe, after France. Mr David is participating 'to support US government efforts to promote peace through economic development'. UT already employs 1,100 in the province making wire automotive harnesses. Only a handful of British companies not already involved in Northern Ireland are thought to have agreed to attend, although the number may grow. Overseas investment in Northern Ireland has totalled Pounds 1.6bn since 1986, involving 265 projects. About one-third of the investments are from the US, with a considerable number from the Far East, notably Korea and Japan. After the speeches on Wednesday morning delegates will be offered tours of factory sites, where they will be told of wages 16 per cent below the UK average, grants of up to 50 per cent of start-up building costs and a pool of skilled labour. One company certain to be visited is US-owned Seagate Technology, in Derry. It employs 270 people making hard disc drive components. Mr Michael Caulfield, the managing director said: 'Nowhere else offered us the combination of grants and incentives, which cut our start-up costs, plus a dedicated and competitively priced labour force.'

Mr John Major, the prime minister, told the Commons that the proposals would give 'focus and direction' to the so-called three-strand talks, which collapsed last year when the Unionist parties walked out. Mr Major gave no details of the peace plan, but Downing Street said it was an attempt to bring about a permanent settlement of the Northern Ireland conflict. The plan is believed to focus on the establishment of a Northern Ireland assembly and the revitalisation of local government, which has been moribund since the imposition of direct rule in 1974. It also builds on the agreement between the British and Irish governments in Brussels last week, which set out a framework for talks with all Northern Ireland parties except Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA. The plan is aimed largely at the Ulster Unionists, who have long pressed for devolution from Westminster to remove control of the province from the Northern Ireland Office. Initial reaction from Unionists suggested that the government may have to offer further concessions to tempt the parties back to the negotiating table. The Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the hardline Democratic Unionist party, last night warned the prime minister that further talks with the Irish government, due to take place tomorrow in Belfast, could 'bring yet further outrages'. In a letter to Mr Major, Mr Paisley says: 'I implore you to hold it elsewhere.' He believes further talks with the Irish government would inflame the Protestant community. He said that he would agree to talks with the Irish government only if it gave up its constitutional claim to a united Ireland. Mr Paisley said Mr Major had agreed to meet him soon. Mr John Taylor, Europe spokesman for the Ulster Unionist party, the biggest Unionist grouping, welcomed the prospect of fresh proposals but dismissed the round-table format as 'flawed'. He called for the plan to be discussed in a series of bilateral meetings between the government and the constitutional parties. Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, appeared willing to go along with that approach last night. Sir Patrick said the peace process could resume with 'bilateral private discussions to clear things out of the way, bank what is bankable from last time, and to see what ultimately is a really serious obstacle. Then may be the time to sit round the table'. Ministers were also drawing comfort from the measured response of Mr James Molyneaux, the UUP leader, who plans to take wide soundings among UUP members before commenting later this week. Mr Major's decision to offer a fresh incentive to the Unionists to reopen round-table talks marks the end of any prospects for progress on the joint proposals produced by Mr John Hume, leader of the constitutional nationalist SDLP, and Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein. Mr Major yesterday accepted a request from Mr Hume for a meeting at Downing Street to discuss the proposals, but the government has ruled out even indirect contact with Sinn Fein until the IRA declares an unconditional ceasefire. In Belfast, Mr Adams attempted to resuscitate the Hume-Adams proposals by issuing a statement asserting that 'the leadership of the IRA welcomed the initiative and pointed out that it could provide the basis for peace'.

His trip comes amid continuing anxiety in Whitehall over how US policy on Northern Ireland will develop under President Bill Clinton. Sir Patrick will concentrate on explaining Britain's 'neutral' role in the province but also its commitment to keeping the province as part of the UK so long as that is backed by a majority of its population. Visits to the US by Northern Ireland Office ministers in recent years have tended to concentrate more on promoting investment in the province. Sir Patrick hopes to re-start political talks, in-volving Unionists, nationalists, the British and Irish government after the local elections in the province on May 19. He is opposed to the sending of a US 'peace envoy' as mooted by President Clinton but would accept a delegation with a less specific role. As the government steps up efforts to bring the participants back to negotiations, Mr John Major, prime minister, yesterday met Mr James Molyneaux, leader of the Ulster Unionist party. Mr Molyneaux raised proposals set out in his 'Blueprint for Stability' on Northern Ireland - an agenda that accepts the case for a new assembly in the province but says that, in its absence, the government should improve local democracy. Sir Patrick has not visited the US before as secretary of state and is keen to meet members of the Clinton's administration. On his visits to New York, Washington and Boston he will meet members of the government, Senate, and churches as well as the media. Britain is concerned about the adoption of the so-called 'MacBride principles' for company investment polices by US state and city governments. The principles are meant to promote employment of Catholics but Britain argues that existing 'fair employment' laws are sufficiently tough. There is also concern in London about the possibility of the US granting visas to leaders of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, for propaganda trips.

Joined by sewing machine operators, shop assistants and jumper-knitters from across the country, they formed a phalanx of several thousand people from the Irish rag trade which converged on the Dail (parliament) to impress on deputies that unless VAT rates are reduced, further job losses can be expected in this much-depleted industry. In three successive budgets since 1991, clothing and footwear VAT rates in Ireland have more than doubled, from 10 per cent to the present 21 per cent, making the Irish rate one of the highest in the EC. A recent survey carried out by the Apparel Industries Federation showed as many as a fifth of the 15,000 jobs in clothing manufacturing in Ireland are likely to be lost because of the latest VAT increase. Like other industries it is already suffering under high interest rates and the punt's strength against sterling. Mr Reg McCabe, the federation director, said: 'The effect of VAT is to reduce industry margins; that threatens the profitability of companies and their ability to maintain jobs. (The increase) makes it easier for retailers in the republic to seek their supplies outside, particularly in the UK'. Imported and domestically manufactured clothing is charged at the same 21 per cent VAT rate irrespective of origin, but the industry argues that the latest increase will encourage cross-border shopping to Northern Ireland, encourage chain stores to seek cheaper supplies abroad, and divert 5 per cent of consumer spending on clothing into tax. About 80 per cent of the apparel market is already supplied by imports into Ireland; 50 per cent of the annual IPounds 230m (Pounds 233m) output from Irish clothing makers is exported.

Yesterday's session of strand two of the talks  - which are taking place in three strands, or sections  - set no new deadline. But it was decided that after three days of talks in Dublin this week, the next round will return to Belfast next week. When the talks began last April, the intention was that they would be concluded by the end of July. That deadline was later extended until the end of this month. Mr David Andrews, the Irish foreign minister, said the presence in Dublin of leaders of the Ulster Unionist party from Northern Ireland was a 'historic' event, but added that he did not wish to over-emphasise this 'out of sensitivity for the other participants'. Yesterday's session at Dublin Castle was the first time since the partition of Ireland in 1922 that unionist leaders had visited Dublin for political discussions. The Democratic Unionist party (DUP), led by the Rev Ian Paisley, stayed away from the talks for part of last week and is boycotting this week's Dublin phase, arguing that the Irish government has not demonstrated any flexibility over the territorial claim to Northern Ireland enshrined in its constitution. Articles Two and Three of the 1937 Irish constitution lay claim to the six counties of Northern Ireland. Mr Paisley attacked the Ulster unionists yesterday for meeting the Irish ministers, saying: 'Some of the unionist negotiators drink at the bar with these men . . . my party is not in that business. The only time we address them is across the table when we are standing up for what Ulster stands for and will stand for.' Terrorism and security matters, the issues of identity and allegiance, as well as what is considered the central issue of the constitutional status of Northern Ireland were touched on yesterday. Mr Andrews said afterwards: 'The discussions were very positive. Every day there are new ideas. Certain progress was enhanced by today's business.' A bilateral meeting between the British and Irish governments is due to be held this evening and is expected to set a date for the next meeting of the Anglo-Irish conference. This will also be a bilateral meeting of the two governments and will take place in the context of the 1985 Hillsborough Agreement  - to which the unionists are opposed, as it gave Dublin a say, albeit minimal, in Northern Ireland's affairs. It was at the insistence of the DUP that the Anglo-Irish conferences were suspended last April to allow the talks process to proceed. The talks are designed to find a replacement to the agreement. Last month it was agreed that the next bilateral conference would not be held 'before September 28'. Both the British and Irish governments are concerned that any further postponement of the conference would undermine the 1985 agreement, but there is also concern that the convening of a new conference might prompt the DUP to withdraw from the round-table talks altogether.

Talks bringing Northern Ireland's constitutional parties together for the first time for 15 years start next Tuesday with a series of meetings in Belfast. They will include bilateral 'agenda-setting' meetings followed about a week later with plenary sessions on internal government in the province. Agreement, however, has still to be reached on where talks will be held on relations between north and south Ireland and between the UK and Irish governments. Unionists are believe to favour London but the Irish government is thought to prefer somewhere within the island of Ireland. A compromise might be a Northern Ireland town outside Belfast - possibly Armagh, Ireland's ecclesiastical capital. The prospect of political progress in the province will dominate today's meeting between Mr Peter Brooke, Northern Ireland secretary, and Mr Gerry Collins, Irish foreign minister. Mr Brooke will also raise the recent controversy over alleged leaks by the Irish police to IRA terrorists. The meeting will be the last conference under 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement before the start of the wide-ranging talks engineered by Mr Brooke, and which could see the agreement being replaced.

Senior ministers from both countries, including Mr Spring, joined forces to emphasise that there could be no negotiations with Sinn Fein without a permanent end to IRA violence. Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, edged towards accepting Mr Spring's weekend message that a temporary IRA ceasefire would be 'a step in the right direction'. Sir Patrick acknowledged that a temporary ceasefire would be 'better than violence'. Their efforts came as the Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the hardline Democratic Unionist party, emerged from a stormy meeting with Mr John Major to declare that June's European elections in Ulster would in effect be a referendum on the Downing Street declaration. Mr Paisley said he intended to meet the prime minister again after the DUP had secured 'a firm mandate from the people'. The DUP leader - whose party is boycotting the political talks process  - traditionally secures the biggest vote in the province's European elections. Mr Michael Ancram, the Northern Ireland minister, said Mr Major 'took Mr Paisley to task' for misinterpreting the joint declaration on a number of occasions, and areas of common ground were 'fairly few and far between' in the course of a 'very frank' 30-minute meeting. Downing Street officials said Mr Major told Mr Paisley and his DUP colleagues that he had a UK-wide mandate for the task of stopping the day-to-day horror in Northern Ireland. In Dublin, Mr Spring and Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, emphasised after talks that there would be no negotiations with Sinn Fein unless there was 'a clear and unequivocal renunciation of violence' by the IRA. But Mr Spring reiterated that Dublin would seek to build on any temporary IRA ceasefire. Mr Hurd used a speech in Dublin to the Institute of European Affairs to argue that the relationship between Britain and Ireland had been transformed and was 'no longer transfixed by difficulties rooted in the past'.

The proposals conflict sharply with a peace plan published yesterday by the Democratic Unionist party, led by the Rev Ian Paisley, which rules out any role for Dublin. However, the UUP's approach bodes well for the peace process launched two weeks ago by Mr John Major, the prime minister, and Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish premier. The Major-Reynolds initiative has shown signs of running out of steam as a result of Unionist fears that Dublin is willing to talk to Sinn Fein, the political arm of the IRA. Ministers are understood to see the UUP's proposals as signs of 'positive thinking' that could contribute to a settlement in proposed round-table talks between the two governments and Northern Ireland's four non-violent political parties. Mr Ken Maginnis, the UUP deputy leader, said the proposals were based on the party's final presentation to the last round-table talks, which broke down a year ago. The UUP blames the failure of the last round on the Irish government's refusal to cede ground on Unionist demands for the withdrawal of its constitutional claim to the province. The Irish government has since said it would be prepared to drop its territorial claim as part of an overall settlement that would be subject to majority consent. The UUP proposals were discussed this week by Mr Major and Mr James Molyneaux, the UUP leader. They focus on the creation of a Northern Ireland assembly with an inter-Irish relations committee, which would represent a 'formal link' with the Irish parliament. The UUP also proposes a bill of rights to allay the fears of the Catholic minority, and a 'meaningful role' in the administration of the province for the nationalist SDLP. The DUP proposals, entitled Breaking the Logjam, call for elections to a Northern Ireland assembly, which would draw up a new constitution for the province within the UK. The document, handed to the government six weeks ago, says that proposals gaining 60 per cent support within the assembly would be put to parliament. The final package would be subject to a Northern Ireland referendum. Mr Paisley said Sinn Fein would be allowed to stand for election to the assembly, but would be excluded from negotiations on the form of the government.

Mr Molyneaux used a parliamentary early-day motion to highlight the Irish government's failure to act 'in a fair and honourable manner' over nominations to the Irish Racing Authority. He called on the UK government to 'reconsider proposals for co-operation between the two administrations in Ireland' in the light of the way Dublin had acted. The move pointed up how carefully London and Dublin are having to tread in their efforts to secure a durable political settlement in the province. It emerged earlier this week that the UK government has virtually given up hope of agreeing with Dublin the framework for a comprehensive settlement in time for the next Anglo-Irish summit later this month. Downing Street said yesterday that a number of important and complex issues had still to be settled. The main differences involve the repeal of Dublin's constitutional claim to Ulster and the shape and authority of proposed joint boards to enhance cross-border co-operation. London believes no credible agreement is possible if the issue of Dublin's territorial claim is not resolved. Yesterday's motion said Dublin had 'contemptuously ignored' the Northern Ireland racing industry's nomination of a representative to the 'incongruously named' Irish Racing Authority. This replaced the Turf Club of Ireland, which had 'hitherto administered racing on all courses in Ireland including Downpatrick and Down Royal, in Northern Ireland, to the satisfaction of those concerned'. The motion called on the Department of Agriculture for Northern Ireland to 'intervene and ensure fair play'.   Countries:-  IEZ  Ireland, EC.     GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

0,FT934-6890 ,"FT934-6890 _AN-DKWCOAB8FT 931123   FT  23 NOV 93 / Ulster peace 'only by political deal'      By DAVID OWEN   Peace in Northern Ireland can only come through a political settlement, Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, warned yesterday, as wrangling continued between London and Dublin over the pace of the peace process. Speculation mounted that the Anglo-Irish summit might be put back from the December 3 date favoured by Dublin after Downing Street gave its clearest hint yet that more time may be needed to set the framework for a settlement. Officials sought to lower expectations of the Dublin meeting and said much work on any draft communique was still to be done. Detailed British proposals for a new accord to replace the 1985 Anglo-Irish agreement fall far short of Dublin's call for a significant element of joint responsibility in the administration of the province, while recognising Dublin's aspirations to a united Ireland. In London, Lord Tebbit, the former Tory cabinet minister, sought to pour more cold water on the Major-Reynolds initiative, telling an audience of Tory rightwingers that the IRA would only lay down its arms for a deal that undermined 'the union of Ulster within the United Kingdom'. 'So unless there is a willingness somewhere within government to undermine that union . . . I find it difficult to understand why those in authority speak of the prospects for peace,' he said. The Irish government would not be satisfied with anything that did not 'advance the cause of the alternative union - that of a united Ireland'. In Belfast Sir Patrick denied that differences between London and Dublin were widening. He said the people of Northern Ireland were 'longing for an end of violence and they are longing for a political settlement that will enable people in this divided community to live more tranquilly together'. His remarks came a day after Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, stressed in a television interview the possibility of achieving peace before a political settlement. The Army confirmed yesterday that many soldiers in Northern Ireland have abandoned helmets in favour of berets as part of a policy to 'soften' their public image.

He emphasised that the discovery at the weekend of an unexploded semtex bomb in Enniskillen showed the importance of the IRA decommissioning its armoury before Sinn Fein was brought into round-table political talks on the future of the province. 'What the planting of this device shows precisely is why it is so important to deal with the problems of weapons and explosives.' Referring to yesterday's bilateral contacts with Sinn Fein, Mr Major commented: 'We have always made clear that there can be no question of political representatives of paramilitary organisations entering the political process until they have a commitment to exclusively peaceful methods  - and have demonstrated that commitment to exclusively peaceful methods.' The prime minister would not specify how Britain would react to the decommissioning of the IRA weapons stockpile. But he expressed hopes that continued peace would bring further gradual moves in security and policing operations in Northern Ireland. 'Both the government and the Royal Ulster Constabulary would like to move to wholly civilian policing . . . that is going to take some time but it is a clear objective.' In a response to suggestions from Mr Albert Reynolds, Mr Bruton's predecessor, that Britain had conceded the creation of a new cross-border institution with executive powers, Mr Major said: 'There is no question of joint authority, which is what worries the people of Northern Ireland.' Mr Major stressed that, once completed, the framework document would be a basis for discussion among the Northern Ireland parties, not a blueprint for a new political settlement imposed by the British and Irish governments. Any new arrangements would require the consent of the people and would be submitted eventually to a referendum. 'If we have learnt anything about the Northern Ireland problem over recent years it is that you have to carry the people of Northern Ireland with you,' Mr Major said. 'We must earn and keep their trust and they must be clear that there is nothing going on that would unsettle either main tradition . . . So those people who are thinking: 'Gosh, there is some murky work at the crossroads' are wholly wrong.' Mr Major expected today's meeting with Mr Bruton to be an informal discussion. He said it was too early to say whether the document would be completed in January. 'We will move ahead as speedily as we can. There are still some difficult issues to be determined. I think they are determinable but it will take a little while.'   Countries:-  IEZ  Ireland, EC.     GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P9721 International Affairs.

0,FT944-3034 ,"FT944-3034 _AN-ELOCSAC3FT 941215   FT  15 DEC 94 / Belfast Investment Conference: Happy in the shadow of De Lorean - Jimmy Burns visits a components manufacturer whose managing director has grown to like the city      By JIMMY BURNS   When Montupet, a French car components manufacturer, announced plans to set up a Pounds 90m operation near Belfast in December 1988 it promised to give the local economy its most significant boost in recent years. It was the biggest single project secured by Northern Ireland's Industrial Development Board, and the biggest initial investment by an overseas company in Northern Ireland. Yesterday the manufacturer's Belfast subsidiary was among a select group of companies shown off to delegates as an example of the benefits that peace can bring. The challenges and potential pitfalls that Montupet has had to meet typified the problems faced by inward investors in the province. What made the investment particularly significant was its location at the Dunmurry site near Belfast where Mr John De Lorean, the flamboyant the US entrepreneur, had planned to build a luxury sports car. De Lorean's closure in 1982, with a net loss of Pounds 50m of taxpayers' money, was one of the most spectacular failures in the British government's long-running campaign to attract overseas investment to Northern Ireland. Overcoming that legacy has not been easy for Montupet, as its managing director, Mr Georges Senninger, admits. 'Ever since we started up in Dunmurry, people have been asking the same question: how long are you going to last? Are you going to pack up like De Lorean?' he says. Far from it. Mr Senninger has grown to like Belfast, a city he admits he once found 'depressing'. And he is not merely wedded to the place - a few months ago he married a local woman. Like other foreign companies, Montupet was lured to Northern Ireland by a generous package of incentives offered by the IDB. This covered 30 per cent of capital investment, 50 per cent of training costs, and wage subsidies amounting to a one-off bonus of Pounds 6,000 per employee. Mr Senninger insists the package - less than the 70 per cent to 80 per cent of costs which can in theory be made available by the IDB - was not the most important factor behind the investment decision. The main short-term attraction was the availability of a cheap factory site capable of integrating Montupet's European operations, and the low cost of industrial land - Pounds 60,000 per acre compared with Pounds 185,000 in the East Midlands. Longer-term considerations included the availability of a skilled workforce which would work for lower rates than on the UK mainland or in France. Since starting up in March 1990, Montupet - like a number of other companies given generous grants by the IDB - has failed to meet promised production and employment targets. Output is now at the level it should have been at the start of 1992, while the workforce is 500, rather than the 900 expected. Mr Senninger rejects the suggestion that generous grants contributed to lax management attitudes and poor investment strategies. He blames the crisis that affected the world car industry in the early 1990s: 'The market shrank and that was it.' But the company has weathered the crisis and still projects itself as an example of how businesses can survive in Northern Ireland in spite of adverse circumstances. The Dunmurry site now produces cylinder heads for Ford's Bridgend and Cologne plants, and wheels for Peugeot and Renault. It has secured further orders to supply engine blocks to Volkswagen. Production lines are running nearly at capacity and recruitment has started again. Located between staunchly Protestant and Catholic areas, Montupet has recruited equally from both communities. Only occasionally in the past four years has Mr Senninger, a French-born Catholic, been reminded that Northern Ireland is not quite the tolerant haven that the IDB's image makers try to portray to first-time visitors. Soon after the plant started up, it was attacked by youths throwing stones from the nearby Catholic Twinbrook estate. The security forces blamed the IRA. Mr Senninger thinks the authorities overreacted and regrets that he was obliged to spend more on private security than he would have liked. 'The kids had got used to using the disused De Lorean testing track for joy riding. They didn't like us taking away their playground,' he says with a shrug. On a personal level he was more affected by a row with the Royal Ulster Constabulary which led to a court appearance. 'They arrested me just because I had a foreign accent. It was absolutely unbelievable.' More disturbing on a personal level is the fact that his wife - a local Catholic - is afraid to use her Christian name in some Protestant areas of Belfast. Such experiences leave Mr Senninger cautious about the future. 'The paramilitary ceasefires are a good start, but only a start. The province needs a total cultural change and that's going to take time. I think the government has some hard selling to do.'   Companies:-  Montupet.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

The Joint Declaration was framed as a balanced set of  principles, fairly addressing the concerns and aspirations of  both traditions in Northern Ireland. It demonstrated that, in  their approach to Northern Ireland's future, the governments of  the United Kingdom and of the Republic of Ireland stand on  common ground.    The Declaration underlined the principle that the future of  Northern Ireland must be founded on consent. If offered the  people of Ireland, North and South respectively, the basis to  agree that their differences could be negotiated and resolved  exclusively by peaceful political means.    The Declaration looked to the full participation in politics  of ""democratically mandated parties which established a  commitment to exclusively peaceful methods and which have shown  that they abide by the democratic process"".    To join the political dialogue with the two governments,  parties were not required to accept the Joint Declaration. They  were required only to declare and demonstrate a permanent end to  violence, and to abide by the democratic process.    Since its adoption, the Joint Declaration has attracted very  wide support thoughout Ireland and far beyond. More than ever,  the people of Northern Ireland want to live in peace and to  resolve their problems democratically and by negotiation.    Yet paramilitary and sectarian violence continues. They see  no justification for this. The Joint Declaration shows that  there is none. It is against this background that we are today  publishing the questions from Sinn Fein, passed to us by the  Irish Government, within this statement.    We have always sought to ensure that our position on the  Joint Declaration is clearly understood by all. As both  Governments have repeatedly emphasised, the terms of the  Declaration are not open to negotiation. Nor will we enter into  questions about future arrangements in Ireland which can  properly be decided only through negotiations involving  democratic parties dedicated exclusively to peaceful political  means.    Both Governments are anxious to see such negotiations take  place on a comprehensive basis, as set out in the Declaration.    Our comments on this document are as follows.    As will readily be seen, the questions which have been  passed  to us range much more widely than seeking elucidation of the  text of the Joint Declaration, though some can be dealt with by  reference to it.    The questions can be considered under these headings:    (i) Questions involving an explanation of the text of the  Joint Declaration; (ii) Questions which appear to seek to  reopen the negotiations which led to the Joint Declaration;    (iii) Questions concerning the British Government's policy  in  respect of Northern Ireland which, far from arising from any  uncertainty about the text of the Joint Declaration, are  answered by reference to it.    (iv) Questions not arising directly from the text of the  Joint Declaration but concerning procedures consequent on a  cessation of violence, including questions about the agenda for  subsequent substantive political dialogue.    (v) Questions not arising from any obscurity in the text of  the Joint Declaration but raising substantive questions of wider  Government policy, or questions which would arise in a process  of substantive political dialogue following a cessation of  violence.    (vi) Questions repeating earlier questions or essentially  covering the same ground.    These headings are dealt with in turn. There were 20  questions in the (Sinn Fein) paper passed (to us) by the Irish  Government, and the question numbers which follow are those from  that paper.    I. Questions Involving an Explanation of the Text of the  Joint Declaration.    Q. 4 The British Government says, in the Downing Street  Declaration, ""that they will uphold the democratic wishes of a  great number of the people of Northern Ireland."" What is the  British Government's precise definition of ""a greater number of  the people of Northern Ireland"" and how would this be measured  in practical terms?    Comment    The wish of a greater number of the people of Northern  Ireland would be determined by a numerical majority of those  validly voting in a poll fairly and explicitly organised for  this purpose. Provision for such a poll is made in section 1 of  the Northern Ireland Constitution Act: 1973.    II. Questions which appear to seek to reopen the  negotiations which led to the Joint Declaration.    Q.2 Given that the document put to you in June 1993 was  welcomed by the IRA leadership which commented, on October 3,  1993, that it ""could form the basis for peace"", could you  clarify the differences, if any, between this document and the  Downing Street Declaration?    Comment    This question, referring to a document put to us by the  Irish  Government, does not arise from any uncertainty about the text  of the Joint Declaration which was the product of detailed and  extensive discussions between the two Governments.    These discussions were largely directed towards ensuring  that  the Declaration was clear and unambiguous in its treatment of  the key principles to which both Governments are committed --  including consent, agreement, and parity of esteem and equity of  treatment for both parts of the community in Northern Ireland.    Therefore the only text that bears our name and on which we  can comment is that which was issued on 15 December, 1993, by  the Prime Minister and the Taoiseach [Irish Prime Minister  Albert Reynolds] .    III. Questions concerning the British Government's policy  in respect of Northern Ireland which, far from arising from any  uncertainty about the text of the Joint Declaration are answered  by reference to it.    Q.1 The long-term political objectives of the two  Governments are of crucial importance if we are to move out of  the conflict situation caused by the present failed political  structures.    The Taoiseach has clearly stated the long-term objectives of  the Irish Government in the search for a lasting settlement. It  is essential that the British Government displays the same  honesty and frankness in outlining its long-term attitude  towards the Irish people.    What are the British Government's long-term interests and  objectives in relation to Ireland?    Comment    Paragraph 4 of the Joint Declaration already spells out the  British Government's objectives and interests in relation to  Ireland -- in terms which speak for themselves. In particular,  it states that the British Government's ""primary interest is to  see peace, stability and reconciliation established by agreement  among all the people who inhabit the island, and they will work  together with the Irish Government to achieve such an agreement,  which will embrace the totality of relationships.""    Q.3 The British and Irish Governments have said that the  political structures cannot be predetermined, now or in the  future. How do you reconcile this with your adherence to the  partition of Ireland and the maintenance of the union?    Paragraph 4 of the Joint Declaration makes it clear that the  British Government ""will uphold the democratic wish of a greater  number of the people of Northern Ireland on the issue of whether  they prefer to support the Union or a sovereign united Ireland.""    Further, the Government reaffirm as a binding obligation  that  they will introduce the necessary legislation to give effect to  any measure of agreement on future relationships in Ireland  which the people living there, North and South, may themselves  freely determine without external impediment. These statements  confirm that in political dialogue no outcome is either  predetermined or ruled out.    In relation to partition, both Governments are guided by the  reality of the present situation and the principle of consent.  This is reflected in Article 1 of the Anglo-Irish Agreement,  and in paragraph 7 of the Declaration:    ""Both Governments accept that Irish unity would be achieved  only by those who favour this outcome persuading those who do  not, peacefully and without coercion or violence, and that, if  in the future a majority of the people of Northern Ireland are  so persuaded, both Governments will support and give legislative  effect to their wish.""    Q.7 Given the British Government's statement in the Downing  Street Declaration that it is for the Irish people to exercise  our right to self-determination, what is the basis for the  British Government's qualification of this right in Paragraph 4  of the Downing Street Declaration?    Comment    The British Government's position on self-determination in  paragraph 4 of the Joint Declaration -- that it is to be  exercised ""on the basis of consent, freely and concurrently  given, North and South..."" -- is entirely consistent with that  of the Irish Government set out in Paragraph 5 of the Joint  Declaration in which the Taoiseach: ""accepts, on behalf of the  Irish Government, that the democratic right of  self-determination by the people of Ireland as a whole must be  achieved and exercised with and subject to the agreement and  consent of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland and  must, consistent with justice and equity, respect the democratic  dignity and civil rights and religious liberties of both  communities.""    IV. Questions not arising directly from the text of the  Joint Declaration, but concerning procedures consequent on a  cessation of violence, including questions about the agenda for  subsequent substantive political dialogue.    Q.8 In the Downing Street Declaration the British Government  gives a commitment to allow the Irish people to freely determine  our future without external impediment or interference, to  encourage, facilitate and enable agreement on this basis and to  introduce the necessary legislation to give effect to this  agreement. Does this mean that the Government of Ireland Act,  Section 75 of which states ""the supreme authority of the  parliament of the United Kingdom shall remain unaffected and  undiminished over all persons, and things in (Northern) Ireland  and every part thereof,"" would be needed as part of an overall  agreement?    Comment    The content of an overall agreement will depend on the  outcome of negotiations within the talks process. The British  Government have confirmed that they wil introduce the necessary  legislation to give effect to any measures of the agreement in  future relationships which the people of Ireland may freely  determine on the basis set out in paragraph 4 of the Joint  Declaration. The implications for the Government of Ireland Act  would depend on the nature and content of any such agreement.    Q.11 Given the commitment by the two governments that  everything will be on the table for negotiation:    (a) Will the union between Ireland and Britain be on the  agenda for negotiation?    (b) Will the Government of Ireland Act be on the agenda for  negotiation?    Comment    The 26 March 1991 statement, outlining the basis for the  three stranded talks, said that ""in order to ensure a full  airing of the issues, it will be open to each of the parties to  raise any aspect of these relationships, including  constitutional issues, or any other matter which it considers  relevant"". No political objective could properly be excluded  from discussion in the talks process.    Q.13 Does the British Government accept that while the  consent of a majority of the people of the six county state to  constitutional change, as referred to in the Downing Street  Declaration, may be desirable it is not a legal requirement in  international law?    Comment    Both Governments make clear in the Joint Declaration that  any  change in the constitutional status of Northern Ireland would be  subject to the consent of a majority of its people as set out in  the Anglo-Irish Agreement, itself an international instrument  registered at the United Nations.    Q.14 Given the commitment in the Downing Street Declaration  to work towards a balanced constitutional accommodation does the  British Government accept that the present structures and  arrangements do not represent a balanced constitutional  accommodation? [no comment on Q.14 as received]    Q.15 Given the commitment in the Downing Street Declaration  to work towards a balanced constitutional accommodation, what  constitutional options does the British Government see as being  consistent with this objective?    Comment    In paragraph 1 of the Joint Declaration both Governments  recognise an ""absence of a lasting and satisfactory settlement  of relationships between the peoples of both islands..."".  Constitutional issues are among those eligible to be addressed  in the talks process.    Q.17 The Taoiseach has said that political parties need not  accept every phrase or word in the Downing Street Declaration.  In fact the DUP [Democratic Unionist Party] have rejected the  Declaration in total and the UUP [Ulster Unionist Party] have  said that it has run its course.    (a) Does the rejection of the Declaration by a political  party exclude that party from involvement in talks on the  development of new political arrangements?    (b) Do parties which are opposed to aspects of the Downing  Street Declaration have the right to dissent from it and yet be  engaged in talks on the development of new political  arrangements?    Comment    The Declaration is an agreed position between the two  Governments. It does not depend for its validity on the  attitude of other parties, who are free to determine their own  views on it, and to represent those views in future negotiations.    Acceptance of the Joint Declaration is not a precondition  for  entering the talks process. What IS required is a permanent end  to the use of, or support for, paramilitary violence. The two  Governments say in the Joint Declaration that ""...in these  circumstances, democratically mandated parties which establish a  commitment to exclusively peaceful methods and which have shown  that they abide by the democratic process, are free to  participate fully in democratic politics and to join in dialogue  in due course between the Governments and the political parties  on the way ahead.""    Q.18 Exploratory Dialogue    Sinn Fein, as a matter of policy, advocates inclusive  dialogue without preconditions. We do not accept the imposition  of preconditions on our party or on any other party. However,  in the interests of clarity we wish to explore the British  Government position on these matters as outlined in the Downing  Street Declaration.    (a) The British Government has called upon Sinn Fein to  renounce violence. What does this involve?    (b) Patrick Mayhew is reported as saying that a permanent  cessation of violence ""is the way in which full recognition can  be accorded to the mandate which Sinn Fein candidates are  accorded at the polls"" (Irish Times, Thursday, 14/4/94). How  does the British Government reconcile its refusal to recognise  our democratic mandate with its stated commitment to democratic  principles?    (c) The British Prime Minister has referred to a period of  decontamination for Sinn Fein. What does this mean?    (d) What would be the purpose of the exploratory dialogue  between Sinn Fein and the British Government?    (e) How long would this exploratory dialogue last?    (f) Within this process, when would negotiations about the  future constitutional and political shape of Ireland take place?    Comment    The position of both Governments is set out clearly in  Paragraph 10 of the Joint Declaration. There has to be a  permanent end to the use of, or support for, paramilitary  violence. In these circumstances ""democratically mandated  parties which establish a commitment to exclusively peaceful  methods and which have shown that they abide by the democratic  process, are free to participate fully in democratic politics  and to join in dialogue in due course between the Governments  and the political parties on the way ahead.""    For Sinn Fein and the IRA this would involve a public and  permanent renunciation of violence as a means of achieving  political ends, and commitment to peaceful and democratic means  alone.    Within three months, as has already been publicly made  clear, the British Government would in these circumstances begin  exploratory dialogue with Sinn Fein. The purposes of such  dialogue would be:    (i) to explore the basis upon which Sinn Fein would come to  be admitted to an inclusive political talks process to which the  British Government is committed but without anticipating the  negotiations within that process;    (ii) to exchange views on how Sinn Fein would be able over a  period to play the same part as the current constitutional  parties in the public life of Northern Ireland;    (iii) to examine the practical consequences of the ending of  violence.    The reason for the time lapse between a permanent cessation  of violence and exploratory dialogue is to enable the commitment  to exclusively peaceful and democractic methods to be fully  demonstrated.    The British Government accept the validity of all electoral  mandates, including that of Sinn Fein; and, being committed to  the democratic process, endorses the freedom of voters to choose  their elected representatives. There is no inconsistency  between this and requiring that all who join in political  dialogue should demonstrate a commitment to exclusively peaceful  methods and to the democratic process. Democracy and violence  cannot be reconciled.    Q.20 The Downing Street Declaration is described as ""the  starting point of a peace process designed to culminate in a  political settlement."" What are the subsequent steps which the  British Government envisages as part of a process of dialogue,  reconciliation and demilitarisation leading to peace and a  political settlement?    Comment    Paragraphs 10 and 11 of the Joint Declaration and associated  statements (see comment on Question 18 above) spell out what  will happen when there is a permanent cessation of violence.  The exploratory dialogue leading to Sinn Fein's involvement in  the political talks process would then begin. A lasting and  general peace would render military operations in support of the  police no longer necessary.    If the Joint Declaration is ""the starting point of a peace  process,"" the next step is for the violence to end for good.    V. Questions not arising from any obscurity in the text of  the Joint Declaration, but raising substantive questions of  wider Government policy, or questions which would arise in a  process of substantive political dialogue following a cessation  of violence.    Q.5 The British Government has said that it has ""no selfish  strategic or economic interest in Northern Ireland."" Would it  not be more in accord with democratic principles for the British  Government to base its Irish policy on the objective of ending  the union?    Comment    The Joint Declaration makes it clear that the British  Government is committed to upholding the principle of consent.    Q.6 The British Government has said that its primary  interest is to see agreement reached between all the Irish  people.    (a) Given the continued intransigent attitude of the  Unionist  leadership, how, in real terms, is such an agreement to be  reached, particularly if the unionist leadership refuses to  engage in the search for agreement?    (b) What is the framework which the British Government  intends to create for the achievement of agreement. [no graf (c)  as received]    (d) Does the British Government accept that, given the  weight  of nationalist opinion throughout Ireland in opposition to  partition, that substantial movement on constitutional issues by  the British Government and the Unionist Parties will be required  if democratic agreement is to be reached?    e) How is agreement to be measured in practical terms and at  what stage does the withholding or absence of agreement on the  part of one section of the Irish people become a veto over  change?    Comment    In Paragraph 4 of the Joint Declaration, the British  Government commits itself to working together with the Irish  Government to achieve peace, stability and reconciliation  established by agreement among all the people who inhabit the  island and to ""encourage, facilitate and enable the achievement  of such agreement..."". No organisation has a veto over that  process, whether by withdrawing from it or by refusing to  renounce violence. The two Governments will continue to seek  agreement between themselves and the main constitutional parties  in Northern Ireland on the basis of the agreed statement of 26  March 1991 -- focusing on the three main relationships which are  those within Northern Ireland, among the people of the island of  Ireland and between the two Governments. A keynote of the Joint  Declaration is that any new arrangements must be founded on  consent. It would be wrong to attempt to anticipate the outcome  of the discussions or to set an artificial time limit on the  achievement of agreement on issues of fundamental importance to  the people of these islands. Other issues raised in this  question are properly the concern of participants in the process  of political dialogue.    Q.16 The Taoiseach has said that Unionists possess a veto  only in regard to whether to belong to a sovereign United  Ireland or the UK, that they do not possess a veto over the  policy of the two governments or over interim measures which may  be adopted. Is this also the position for the British  Government?    Comment    No group or organisation has a veto over the policy of a  democratically elected Government. The policy of both  Governments, set out in the Joint Declaration, is however,  founded firmly on the principles of democracy, agreement and  consent.    Q.19 (a) Given the declared opposition of both Governments  to coercion, how will the coercion of Northern nationalists  into the six county state be addressed in real terms?    (b) How will the denial of nationalist rights be redressed  in real terms?    (c) When will repressive legislation be ended?    Comment    This question is based on assumptions which have no  foundation in reality. The Government's approach is reflected  by paragraph 4 of the Joint Declaration which includes the  statement that:    ""The role of the British Government will be to encourage,  facilitate and enable the achievement of... agreement over a  period through a process of dialogue and co-operation based on  full respect for the rights and identities of both traditions in  Ireland.""    It is the clearly declared aim of both Governments that ALL  new arrangements agreed in the course of political dialogue  should be based on consent. An end to violence would open the  way for a comprehensive reassessment of existing provisions  against terrorism, many of which would become irrelevant and  obsolete in a climate of peace.    VI. Questions repeating earlier questions or essentially  covering the same ground.    Q.9 How does the British Government reconcile its stated  objective of maintaining the union with its declared lack of  strategic or economic interest in Ireland?    Q.10 Given the British Government's declared lack of  ""selfish  strategic or economic interest in Northern Ireland,"" what is the  British Government's political interest in ""Northern Ireland""?    Comment    These points are covered in comment on questions 1 and 8.    Q.12 Given the statement by the British Government in the  Downing Street Declaration that ""it is for the people of the  island of Ireland alone, by agreement between the two parts  respectively, to exercise their right of self-determination on  the basis of consent,""    (a) Is the continued operation of the Government of Ireland  Act subject to agreement on this basis?    (b) Is the continued existence of the union subject to  agreement on this basis?    Comment    There is nothing to add to the comments given above.  Paragraph 4 of the Joint Declaration could not spell out more  clearly the position in relation to the Union.    The Question for Sinn Fein    Sinn Fein have asked their questions. But the most  fundamental question being asked by the people of these islands  is for them to answer. Democracy and violence cannot be  reconciled. Sinn Fein must choose. They know what they have to  do if they are effectively to fulfil their democratic mandate.  The democratic path leads to a meaningful role in the political  process: a process in which, as has been explained, all issues  are open for discussion and negotiation. The alternative is  isolation -- standing on the outside while those committed to  democracy shape the agreement, structures and institutions that  will determine the relationships between the peoples of these  islands.    Sinn Fein claim a commitment to the principle of self-  determination. That means abiding by the will of the people.  The vast majority of people in Ireland, North and South and of  both traditions, demand an end to violence now. Their wishes  could not be clearer. There is no conceivable justification for  continuing to rob people of their lives, least of all a call for  a textual explanation of the Joint Declaration.    Sinn Fein ask what comes next. Certainly no further playing  for time. If the Joint Declaration is ""the starting point of a  peace process"", the next step is for violence to end for good.     "

Under the deal, Washington's annual contribution to the International Fund for Ireland is to increase, subject to congressional approval, from Dollars 20m (Pounds 12.2m) in 1995-96 to Dollars 30m for each of the following two years. The increases will take the total commitment of the Clinton administration to the fund to Dollars 100m. Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, said: 'I am delighted that Northern Ireland is still at the top of the agenda of the American president.' Mr John Hume, leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party, said: 'This is a very welcome announcement by Mr Clinton and confirms the undertakings which he previously gave to help build on the peace. I deeply appreciate the involvement which the president has shown and I am very aware of his willingness to assist us economically.' In addition President Clinton has said he will personally host an international trade and investment conference on Ireland next April in Philadelphia. It was also announced that Mr Ron Brown, US commerce secretary, will be in Belfast for the investment conference organised by the UK government in December. Mr Brown will go on to Dublin for talks. Forty US companies are already operating in Northern Ireland providing 9,000 jobs. The International Fund for Ireland, set up in 1986 by the US and the European Union, last year stood at Pounds 225m. The body provides venture capital for small and medium sized businesses in the province's most depressed areas. Last year it helped create more than 2,600 jobs. There was a more guarded welcome for the package from the Ulster Unionist party. Mr James Wilson, the party's general secretary, said: 'Financial aid is always welcome provided it is fairly distributed in the province and provided it is directed to areas of real need and in support of real jobs.'

Ministers said the Government would publish a ""commentary""  on  the declaration. They insisted that it would not amount to a  clarification, but it would put pressure on the IRA to enter the  peace process. A statement is expected in the Commons by Sir  Patrick Mayhew, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.    Meanwhile, two Catholic building workers were gunned down as  they sat having their lunch on a building site in the Protestant  North Queen Street area of Belfast. In the attack, claimed by  the Ulster Volunteer Force [UVF], the gunmen opened fire with an  automatic weapon, killing the two men almost instantly. A third  man escaped with cuts.    The RUC [Royal Ulster Constabulary] later made arrests and  recovered firearms. A police officer condemned the killings as  blatantly sectarian. The two men, both commuters from rural  areas, were easy targets working in a strongly loyalist area.  One was a 44-year-old father of five, the other was 24 with one  child. Friends denied UVF claims that they were active  republicans. SDLP [Social Democratic Labour Party] councillor  Ignatius Fox said: ""Neither of the two was involved in anything.  They were trying to rear their families and do a day's work.""  The Cabinet committee on Northern Ireland is due to continue  the work today on the response to a series of questions  submitted by Gerry Adams, the president of Sinn Fein. The aim  is to answer the questions in a ""dead-pan"" manner, without  shifting the joint position that Sinn Fein can only enter the  talks process after renouncing violence.    ""An end to violence is the bottom line. We are not getting  involved in negotiations,"" one ministerial source said. Ulster  Unionists have been assured that it will be a ""one-off"" exercise.    Mr Adams said yesterday he was disturbed and concerned at  reports that the Government's answers to Sinn Fein's questions  would not amount to clarification of the Downing Street  declaration.    Mr Adams claimed there was growing concern among  nationalists  that the Government ""may squander yet another opportunity to  advance the peace process."" He called for ""comprehensive,  unambiguous and honest"" responses.    Neither London nor Dublin believes that the Government's  responses stand any change of bringing about a cessation of IRA  violence. The prevailing Northern Ireland Office view is that  Mr Adams has painted himself into a corner and cannot deliver  the republican movement.     "

Sir Patrick defended the rights of the province's nationalists, offered regret if Britain had contributed to the island's sadness, and said that a lasting renunciation of violence by terrorists would have 'profound consequences'. In a speech designed to make clear his strict impartiality, Sir Patrick significantly went further than any of his predecessors in insisting that he was only a 'facilitator of the expression of democratic will in Northern Ireland'. The province would remain part of the UK as long as a majority of its population wanted, he said, but he indicated that he would not embrace a unionist agenda for reforming its government - in spite of the breakdown last month of the round-table political talks. Mr Peter Robinson, deputy leader of the Democratic Unionist party, described Sir Patrick's 'surrender speech' as 'outrageous' and said that 'no unionist will do business with him while he is stuck in a nationalist mode'. Addressing the centre for the study of conflict at the University of Ulster in Coleraine, Sir Patrick expressed 'profound respect' for Irish nationalists such as Charles Parnell and admitted that British involvement in Ireland had not all been positive. 'There is much in the long and often tragic history of Ireland for deep regret, and the British government for its part shares in that regret to the full.' He announced the repeal of 1940s legislation passed by the unionist-dominated former Northern Ireland parliament which prevents local street names being written in Irish as well as English. But Sir Patrick was careful to avoid any hint that the British government would talk to Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, unless it rejected violence. Although terrorism in Northern Ireland's has continued for two decades, Sir Patrick believed its difficulties would be resolved through cross-party dialogue. He said Yugoslavia was an example of which many in Northern Ireland had taken heed. In a recognition of the fears of unionists, he said that Yugoslavia 'has perhaps created a fresh understanding here that, properly understood, 'Brits out' means the ethnic cleansing of a million human beings.' Sir Louis Blom-Cooper QC has been appointed to ensure fair treatment of suspected terrrorists in Ulster's interrogation centres at Castlereagh, Londonderry and Armagh, Sir Patrick Mayhew announced last night.

0,FT943-15913 ,"FT943-15913 _AN-EGGDZAB0FT 940707   FT  07 JUL 94 / Delay likely in reaching Ulster accord      By DAVID OWEN and TIM COONE   The UK government has virtually given up hope of agreeing with Dublin the framework for a comprehensive political settlement in Northern Ireland in time for the next Anglo-Irish summit later this month. With only about two weeks to go before the date pencilled in for this meeting, it emerged at Westminster last night that significant differences remain over at least two crucial issues. Recent contacts between officials working on the agreement are understood to have made little progress. September is now regarded as a more realistic target date for the document's completion. The main differences involve the repeal of Dublin's constitutional claim to Ulster and the shape and authority of proposed joint boards to enhance cross-border co-operation. London believes no credible agreement is possible if the issue of Dublin's territorial claim is not resolved. But it sees little point in granting concessions on north-south relations that would be rejected out of hand by unionists. It is understood, in particular, that Britain has rejected any suggestion that new north-south institutions could imply 'joint authority' over the province. Mr James Molyneaux, the Ulster Unionist leader, last week hinted that his party would take a hard line on the issue by telling MPs that any form of joint authority must 'terminate in British Isles unity for there is no halfway house'. London and Dublin are also divided on whether the framework document should simply provide a starting point for new political talks, in line with London's wishes, or set out a specific blueprint for the province's future. London has consistently avoided setting a firm deadline for completion of the document - covering relations between London and Dublin, cross-border co-operation and outline plans for a new assembly in Northern Ireland. The Republic of Ireland is seeking 'the closest possible links between a Northern Ireland administration and the Irish government', but this would not amount to joint administration with London, Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, said yesterday, Tim Coone writes. Speaking in Dublin to business people from both sides of the border, his comments were made in response to recent criticisms from Unionists in Northern Ireland that the current bilateral talks between the two governments are aimed at establishing a joint authority. Mr Spring said a joint authority 'is not on the Irish government's agenda'. Deeper economic co-operation, however, would be encouraged. It would be 'realistic' to lift cross-border trade from IPounds 1.3bn (Pounds 1.28bn) a year to IPounds 3bn. In spite of deep political divisions 'there are very few who will contest the view that Ireland makes sense as a single economic area,' Mr Spring said.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

The Northern Ireland secretary's comments coincided with the strongest hint yet by Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, that the IRA would not renounce its 25-year armed struggle without such clarification. Mr Adams told the Irish News, a Belfast-based nationalist newspaper: 'I said always what I wanted at the end of this peace process was to end up with a package, a proposition I can bring to the IRA in which hopefully I can make a definitive point which will lead them to change their campaign. I don't have such a package; I don't have such a proposition.' Pressure on the UK government to respond to Sinn Fein's demands has been mounting in recent days, with many leading politicians indicating they think the request is reasonable. Mr John Major, prime minister, has said the demands are 'an increasingly desperate attempt to avoid facing up to the clear choice that confronts them'. Mr Adams last night wrote to Mr Major on the subject. Downing Street last night confirmed that Mr Major had invited Mr John Hume, leader of Ulster's mainly Roman Catholic Social Democratic and Labour Party, for a meeting soon after parliament resumes on Monday. In a move likely to be welcomed by Ulster Unionists, the government also signalled that Mr Michael Ancram, the newly promoted Northern Ireland minister, is to press ahead with talks with leaders of the province's four constitutional political parties within the next two weeks. Meanwhile, pressure mounted on Mr Adams and Mr Hume to publish details of their agreement last year which played a large part in getting the current peace initiative under way after a Dublin newspaper reported the Sinn Fein president had agreed to the principle of majority consent for any constitutional change in the province's status. Mr Hume and Mr Adams both dismissed the reports yesterday as speculation. A Roman Catholic man seriously wounded late on Thursday night was the first victim of loyalist terrorists since the joint declaration was published three weeks ago.

0,FT943-6021 ,"FT943-6021 _AN-EIAD1ABOFT 940901   FT  01 SEP 94 / The IRA Ceasefire: Markets show first flicker of positive response - Economy      By TIM COONE and WILL LEWIS      DUBLIN, BELFAST   The first flicker of a positive response by the markets to the IRA ceasefire came yesterday as several Northern Ireland companies made gains on the London Stock Exchange. The share prices of companies such as Northern Ireland Electricity and Ewart, the property developer, advanced by about 5 per cent to 6 per cent, against an overall FT-SE index gain of 1.7 per cent. It is obviously early days to assert that a trend is emerging from these gains, but they are indicative that business confidence in the province will grow if the ceasefire holds and that economic benefits for the province, and even for the republic, will flow from an end to the violence. Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, said yesterday: 'I have always believed there would be a huge peace dividend for the island of Ireland.' The first payments on that are expected to come from the US. Mr Reynolds talked by phone to US President Bill Clinton yesterday, following the IRA announcement, and said he believed US economic support for the peace process 'is going to be very important'. He added: 'President Clinton assured me today that he going straight away to work at an economic package to underpin the peace process in Northern Ireland.' Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, is to visit Washington shortly to follow this up. The US money will boost confidence, but of far greater importance will be decisions by the business community - both local and from overseas - on whether to boost investment in the province. An FT survey of business opinion in Northern Ireland in December last year revealed that more than half of the 56 leading companies surveyed believed that a political settlement, arising from an end to violence, would have a very positive effect on business and economic opportunities in Northern Ireland. A further 38 per cent believed that the effect would be 'fairly positive'. An additional benefit from an ending of the IRA bombing campaign will be a sharp reduction in compensation costs. The Northern Ireland Office currently pays between Pounds 30m and Pounds 50m a year to individual and corporate victims of the violence. The stationing of some 19,000 British troops in the province, and the maintenance of the RUC police force at a strength of around 12,000, imposes an even heavier burden on the Exchequer - thought to be in excess of Pounds 1bn per year. In addition, there is an Exchequer subsidy to Northern Ireland of a further Pounds 3bn. Economic development will reduce unemployment, raise the taxation base and allow a reduction in this subsidy, which if required could be recycled into investment projects. A joint statement by Mr Doug Riley, chairman of the Confederation of British Industry in Northern Ireland, and Mr Paddy Murphy, president of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said 'real economic benefits' would flow from 'peace and creation of a stable political framework based on agreed democratic principles'. Potential benefits included improved confidence leading to more investment and cross-border trade, the development of new products and 'a more expansive approach which could mean significant new employment opportunities'. Yesterday most small businesses along the Catholic Falls Road and the Protestant Shankill Road were sceptical about the effect of the IRA's statement on their businesses. Mrs Jan Cheevers, owner of Stevensons florists in the Shankill Road, said: 'If peace comes then it may help me, but I can't see that happening.' Her shop is next door to the fish shop bombed by the IRA last October. Nine people and the bomber died. 'There is no trust any more,' she said. Nearly all of her customers are Protestants. A newsagent in the Falls Road who did not wish to be named said: 'I suppose we may get some more tourists up here now, but really things are likely to go on much the same.' The manager of a taxi company based on the Falls Road said that the only benefit he would get was from increased aid from the US. 'If this leads to Clinton giving us more money then that obviously is good. But other than that business will probably go on as normal.'   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

0,FT923-1910 ,"FT923-1910 _AN-CIUDDABBFT 920921   FT  21 SEP 92 / Survey of Northern Ireland (2): Outward signs of activity mask the real story - Statistics paint a gloomy picture      By TIM COONE   ANYONE wanting to place a finger on the economic pulse of Northern Ireland these days, need do no more than stand on the Queen Elizabeth Bridge over the Lagan river in Belfast. From there an outward appearance of feverish activity meets the eye. The unmistakable heavy-lift cranes of the Harland and Wolf shipyard manoeuvre structures on to the hull of a bulk carrier - one of six orders the company won last year; the flash of welding arcs identifies the Lagan weir - the centrepiece of the Laganside development scheme; the ramps for the cross-harbour road and rail link are taking shape; and in the harbour itself, the sleek lines of the SeaCat ferry from Stranraer can be spotted bringing in carloads of tourists that are feeding a renaissance in the province's tourism industry. According to a regional trends survey published in July by the Confederation of British Industry, the economic outlook in the province is better than anywhere else in the UK, with order books growing and businessmen showing confidence by planning new investment. The recession, it would seem, has only been happening over the water. But a different picture emerges from the statistics. The Northern Ireland Economic Council (NIEC), a governmental research and advisory body representing business and trade union interests, notes in a report made in April of this year that 'almost all the indicators . . . show that the Northern Ireland economy has been in recession over the past year. Given that recovery in Northern Ireland has usually lagged behind recovery in the rest of the UK, where GDP and other indicators are still falling, any respite from these problems may be some way off'. 'These indicators add up to what is probably the most gloomy assessment of the Northern Ireland economy that the Council has produced since the last recession in the early 1980s,' it says. Unemployment rose in July to 107,100, up 6,700 on the same month last year, and is now at 14.7 per cent of the workforce. Dr Graham Gudgin, the head of the Northern Ireland Economic Research Centre (NIERC) says his group's econometric model predicts unemployment rising to 16.4 per cent by 1994, to fall later but to remain at 15 per cent until the end of the decade. According to the NIEC, over half the unemployed have been out of work over one year and are classified as long-term unemployed - almost double the UK average of 27 per cent. The recession held off until last year in Northern Ireland, largely because of high public sector employment level and lower house prices resulting in higher disposable incomes than the rest of the UK. But those watching the longer term trends are concerned that when there is an upturn, the province will continue to lag behind the rest of the UK. The announcement earlier this month from Mr Michael Mates, minister of state for finance and security in the province, that Northern Ireland will have to face public spending cuts this year with the rest of the UK, has added further gloom to the picture. more radical approaches are needed. 'Until we get off the current growth path, there is no prospect of any convergence with the mainland economy or our Community partners,' he said. Northern Ireland's GNP per capita is calculated to be around 75 per cent of the rest of the UK, but at the upper end of the poorer regions in the community. The NIEC calculates that if the EC were to continue its average annual growth rate of 3 per cent of the past five years, Northern Ireland would have to grow at an annual 5.4 per cent to achieve convergence over the next 15 years. But figures produced by Dr Gudgin's group show Northern Ireland's economy has rarely outstripped growth in the overall UK economy, and then only during recessions. Inside and outside government, it is acknowledged that the province's high birth rate - one of the highest in western Europe - is a big problem. Job creation programmes, industrial promotion and vocational training are all being actively pursued through various governmental agencies, some of them using EC funding, but Dr Gudgin believes this is not enough. 'If we had the same birth rate as the rest of the UK we would have the same unemployment rate. We have to create a highly skilled mobile workforce and increase the quality of labour, to give people the skills to find jobs.' He said a vocational training programme 'to bring everybody up to A-level standard at vocational level' would create a different outlook for the province. Although A-level results in Northern Ireland are consistently higher than on the mainland, he says 'only a third of students go on to A-levels. It is no good educating just half of the people'. There is little hope of funds being made available for such an ambitious programme though. Public expenditure is targeted at Pounds 7bn for 1992/93 and will rise by an average 2.4 per cent annually in real terms until 94/95. As a proportion of total UK public spending, however, it is declining, according to the NIEC. A growing body of opinion believes that by giving the province autonomous powers and allowing it to work with the Irish Republic to negotiate the allocation of EC structural funds, a higher rate of growth could be achieved. Both parts of the island suffer similar structural problems but for 1989-93 structural funds allocated to Ireland were almost three times on a per capita basis those which were allocated to Northern Ireland. Such an approach would clearly have to clear the hurdle of a political solution. But even those trying to sell Northern Ireland to the outside world, are frank in their assessment of the future if unemployment is not adequately tackled. Mr Billy Pinkerton, a DoE official administering the government's 'Positively Belfast' campaign, said: 'If we don't give the people of Belfast the dignity of employment or further education, someone is going to stick guns in their hands.'

0,FT932-6286 ,"FT932-6286 _AN-DE1BYAG8FT 930528   FT  28 MAY 93 / Survey of UK Relocation (15): An honest answer to overcome fears - Profile of Northern Ireland      By TIM COONE   RESIGNED FOR years to being regarded as just a coloured pin on the map of world trouble spots found in most TV newsrooms, economic planners in Northern Ireland are encouraged that the province is finally attracting attention for more benign reasons. The Industrial Development Board, the government body charged with the task of promoting inward investment to the province, says that in 1992 it had one of its most successful years since it was established 10 years ago. It is estimated that some 1,900 new jobs will result from projects signed up in the past year, five times the number in 1991. Most notable among the new project announcements are Seagate Technology from California, which is establishing its first plant outside the US at Londonderry, with a Dollars 65m investment to manufacture wafers for computer hard disc drives, and Texmaco, an Indonesian textile firm, which is to invest Pounds 95m in two plants to manufacture new high-tech polyester fibres and fabrics for the European market. Together they will provide some 1,400 jobs when operating at full capacity. Mr Frank Hewitt, the deputy executive director of the IDB, expressed characteristic Belfast caution in assessing the significance of the upturn. 'Several of the projects have been under discussion for a while, and are a result of investment decisions which were probably delayed because of the recession. We will not necessarily have as good a year this year,' he said. Nonetheless, he said, 'Seagate was a tough and hard-fought project, and we are pleased to have won it against the competition'. Attracting companies to invest in Northern Ireland is a particularly difficult task. 'Not only do we have a perceived peripherality problem with the sea crossing, which regions, such as Wales and Scotland do not have, but we also have the security situation and the negative image created by it' said Mr Hewitt. His approach is 'to be totally honest about it all and put it into context. We cannot attract companies here under false pretences as we want to build a long-term relationship with them. That requires both sides being honest with each other'. The peripherality issue was not a big problem for Mr Marimutu Sinivasan, the president of Texmaco. He said: 'Although we will be supplying the European market, we have found that transporting our product from Northern Ireland is absolutely no barrier to having our operation here, a fact borne out by the other Northern Ireland companies we have talked to who are also selling into Europe'. The frequency and reliability of ferry sailings to Stranraer from Belfast and Larne, and the lack of traffic congestion in the province are factors cited by many freight forwarders from the Republic preferring to ship out of the north rather than Dublin 100 miles further south. AVX, a leading manu- facturer of ceramic capacitors used in computers and telecommunications, set up its European distribution centre at Larne in 1991, which the company says was chosen because of the province's advanced telecommunications network. This allows orders from across Europe to be placed electronically and to be delivered within 48 hours. On the issue of political violence, Mr Hewitt points to the security statistics which show Northern Ireland to have one of the lowest crime rates in Europe 'even including the terrorist attacks'. If overcoming these obstacles were not enough, however, the IDB itself has recently drawn fire from behind its own lines. In a report published by the Northern Ireland Accounting Office last February, the IDB was criticised for allowing the level of government contributions to overall project costs to creep up from 21 per cent in 1990/91 to 27 per cent currently. It said that greater attention needed to be paid to the issue of job displacement from elsewhere in the UK and in the IDB's 'value-added' assessment of IDB-funded projects. Mr Hewitt admits that he faces some conflicting objectives - namely to win the inward investment for Northern Ireland, but in doing so to keep the cost to the taxpayer at a minimum. Do the criticisms mean that the IDB will be tougher in assessing projects in the future? Mr Hewitt insisted that the IDB already carries out a very rigorous appraisal process but said that in allocating its Pounds 157m budget this year, 'we are aware we must give value to the taxpayer as well as meet our other objective which is to promote job creation'. An important job creator over the past four years, has been the boom in back-office services moving to Northern Ireland, attracted by lower wage and property costs than in inner-city areas such as London, and top-class telecommunications. Although the driving force for this has lost momentum with the recession, Mr Terence Killen, the IDB section head responsible for promoting such back-office relocations, said: 'Firms should take a longer-term view. Property and wage cost differentials are likely to widen again as the economy recovers. Staff turnover is also much lower here and as investment in people rather than machinery or plant is a feature of the services support industry, this can be very important'. One of the biggest such projects announced to date is that by the new Child Support Agency which is to establish a new centre at Belfast, employing 750 people, and from which it will service all of the east of England.

It brings together decision-makers from the public, private and voluntary sectors, and declares in its promotional material that there is 'almost no limit to what can be achieved within a city when its key people from every sector . . . work together'. It is a bold claim and, after testing it in 17 mainland cities since the charity was launched in 1989, Common Purpose has this year taken its message to Belfast. Organisations seeking to break down barriers between the communities in Northern Ireland risk accusations of presumptuousness or naivety. 'Working together' and 'common purpose' are far from obvious descriptions of many aspects of life in the province. But the request for Common Purpose to bring its initiative to Belfast came from within the city, and is supported by business and voluntary sector leaders. Common Purpose draws recruits from among those who are rising to the top of organisations, operating through discussion sessions and a series of visits and study programmes covering education, health, crime and other social issues. Participants in the first year's programme in Belfast come from organisations including Ulster Bank, Boots, Royal Mail, Shelter, Ulster University, the city council and the probation board. Common Purpose's Belfast programme is its standard one - it does not contain overt sessions on sectarianism - but local promoters of the initiative were determined controversial issues must not be avoided. 'If we failed to consider the divisions within the community the whole thing would be a waste of time,' says Mr George McGrath, British Telecommunication's deputy chief executive in Northern Ireland and chairman of Belfast Common Purpose. 'We were satisfied that these issues would come out as part of the natural examination of aspects of Belfast life. 'It would hardly be possible to discuss crime and punishment, or send the Common Purpose team out with a police or army patrol, without considering the issues that cause division in our society.' Ms Louise Ward Hunter, Common Purpose project leader in Belfast, says early experience indicates that the scheme is avoiding the danger of the exchange of views becoming no more than a repetition of familiar partisan slogans, or generating an artificially polite atmosphere in which straight-talking was avoided. This is supported by evidence from the other efforts to break barriers being made by business and voluntary sectors in the province Mr George Mackey, chief executive of Laganside Development Corporation and an active supporter of Common Purpose's move into Belfast, is also chairman of Business in the Community in Northern Ireland. BITC is trying to strengthen business-community links in a province where sectarian divisions are not the only problem - unemployment at 14.4 per cent is the highest in the UK and an estimated 95,000 children live at or below poverty levels. BITC's Seeing is Believing programme, like Common Purpose, brings business leaders into contact with aspects of life that do not appear on their regular agendas. There are, for example, 400 people serving life sentences in Northern Ireland due for release relatively soon, and a BITC team has been set up to help handle the training and employment aspects of their re-entry into society. Mr Mackey says the reaction of some business leaders during prison visits associated with the initiative has been a 'mixture of voyeurism and shock'. Like Common Purpose, the programme was not set up to promote discussion on violence, crime and punishment in the Northern Ireland context, but has succeeded in doing so. Ms Julia Middleton, founder of Common Purpose, decided to take the scheme to the province after being approached by Mr Quintin Oliver, director of the Northern Ireland Council for Voluntary Action. She is convinced that the popularity and speedy acceptance of the scheme in mainland Britain - 1,500 people with an average age of 38 have already taken part and pilots are planned in France and Germany next year - should ensure that it will withstand the potential difficulties of its introduction in Northern Ireland. Mr Oliver regards such voluntary-sector initiatives as uniquely important in the province. 'A combination of direct rule, the poor reputation of local government and a remote Civil Service with extensive decisionmaking powers denies people the opportunities for grassroots political activity that are available elsewhere,' he says. 'So charities and voluntary organisations have a particularly vital role.'   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P6732 Educational, Religious, etc.     Trusts.

He told an audience of Conservative MPs that the document was designed to give the terrorists a say in shaping the province's political future. Arguing that the declaration would also strengthen the Irish government's role in Ulster's affairs, Mr Paisley said Dublin now had the right to decide 'the sort of institutions and structures to be set up in Northern Ireland. 'Cross-border bodies with a permanent unionist minority and, as proposed by Dublin, with executive functions, are the next stage on the surrender road,' he said. The DUP leader's words came as Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, called on Mr Bill Clinton, the US president, to lift the ban on his entry to the US. Insisting that Sinn Fein was not engaged in armed struggle, Mr Adams said US authorities could help the Northern Ireland peace process by allowing him in to the US. The Sinn Fein president has been invited, along with other leading Ulster politicians, to address the National Committee on American Foreign Policy in New York next week. Mr Adams recently failed in his appeal against an exclusion order keeping him out of mainland Britain. Meanwhile, the political talks process involving the province's constitutional parties continued in Belfast yesterday afternoon with a meeting between Mr Michael Ancram, a junior Northern Ireland minister, and the mainly Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party's four Westminster MPs. The Northern Ireland Office said the two sides agreed on the need for further early progress in the talks 'across all three strands'. They plan to meet again soon. An unexploded letter bomb was found last night at a girls' school run by nuns in the Irish Republic border town of Dundalk. Police believe it had been sent by an Ulster loyalist paramilitary group.

Candidates fielded by three major parties are expected to be  reelected: Ian Paisley for the Democratic Ulster Party (DUP),  Jim Nicholson for the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP, moderate), and  John Hume, a Catholic, for the Social Democratic Labor Party  (SDLP, moderately nationalist).    ""European stakes transcend our traditional fault lines. If  we can cooperate with other European countries in view of a  common interest, then we can work together at home,"" John Hume  pleaded, to no avail. Once again, political and religious  differences will prevail. And both the SDLP, which has been  defending the Anglo-Irish document, and the UUP, which still  favors it, fear the disenchantment of moderate voters with the  slowness of the peace process. In this context, Irish Foreign  Minister Dick Spring explains Dublin's views on the European  election's immediate stakes as well as the conditions for a  potential referendum on Irish reunification.    [Meutey] What is at stake in this European election?    [Spring] It affords citizens a possibility of participating  directly in the activities of European institutions. The powers  of the Parliament have been significantly increased, and today  it has a real decisionmaking role. As the leader of the Labor  Party, I am confident. The Socialists will remain the major  parliamentary group.    [Meutey] Has Euroskepticism taken hold in your country?    [Spring] No. The Irish are aware of the importance of the  European Union [EU] and the need to increase its role in the  years to come. Since Ireland joined the EEC in 1973, polls have  shown that two-thirds of the Irish are in favor of it.    [Meutey] Which foreign policy do you think the EU should  follow?    [Spring] More than ever before, the Europeans must be able  to  speak as one and to act together when faced with situations such  as the Bosnian crisis, the repercussions of the former Soviet  Union's collapse, and the problems in Northern Africa and the  Middle East. Implementing the Maastricht Treaty is the only way  to establish a European foreign policy.    [Meutey] How can the conflict in Northern Ireland be ended?    [Spring] Right now, the best way would be for the Loyalists  and Republicans to seize the chance offered them by the Downing  Street declaration and subsequent texts. If they acknowledge  these texts, they agree to support negotiation efforts between  London and Dublin.    [Meutey] Do you favor reunification?    [Spring] All we want today is to put an end to the killing  in Ulster. For the time being, reunification is not on the  agenda. We must show respect for the Loyalists, who want to  retain their links with Britain. The identity of the 500,000  individuals who want to retain their connections with the Irish  Republic must be respected as well.    [Meutey] When would reunification actually happen, then?    [Spring] When a majority of Ulster's population has  expressed a wish to see it happen....    [Meutey] If Sinn Fein agrees to stop the violence, when  would the referendum take place in Northern Ireland?    [Spring] Even if violence were to stop tomorrow morning, at  least 12 months of talks would be needed. So the referendum  could be held in both Northern and Southern Ireland within a  year.    [Meutey] Will voters in Northern Ireland be asked the same  question as in your country?    [Spring] Ideally, yes. But we must take into account  differences between the two countries. There will likely have  to be two different questions.    [Meutey] Will the referendums be held on the same day?    [Spring] Same day, same time....     "
0,FT944-2521 ,"FT944-2521 _AN-ELSBNAADFT 941216   FT  16 DEC 94 / New Irish PM pledges to continue work for Ulster peace      By JOHN MURRAY BROWN and DAVID OWEN      DUBLIN   Ireland agreed a new coalition government led by the conservative Fine Gael party yesterday, ending a month of political uncertainty after a scandal dragged down its Fianna Fail-Labour predecessor. Mr John Bruton, the Fine Gael leader, supported by 85 votes to 74, becomes Ireland's 10th prime minister, leading a coalition with Mr Dick Spring's Labour party and the Democratic Left of Mr Proinsias De Rossa. Mr Bruton, who succeeds Fianna Fail's Mr Albert Reynolds, said the government's first national aim would be to sustain the Northern Ireland peace process. In London, Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, said he had sought an early meeting with the new Irish premier. Mr Bruton is expected to have his first meeting with Mr Gerry Adams, the leader of Sinn Fein, at today's session of the Dublin government's National Forum for Peace and Reconciliation. Mr Bruton told the Dail (parliament), his government would 'work ceaselessly and sensitively to make peace a permanent part of our future'. His election was welcomed by unionists in Northern Ireland. Mr Peter Robinson, Democratic Unionist MP for East Belfast, said Mr Bruton had a greater understanding of the Ulster Unionist position than most members of the Irish parliament. His desire to change articles two and three of the republic's constitution - claiming territorial jurisdiction over Northern Ireland  - was a 'promising backcloth' to his term in office, Mr Robinson said. Mr Bruton conceded that the government was made up of parties whose 'origins and policies' were very different. But he insisted that 'differences don't have to pose a threat'. Fine Gael, a rurally based party with largely middle-class support, will have eight ministers. Labour, which has projected itself as a European-style secular party, will have six ministers - the same number it had in the outgoing administration. However, Labour's Mr Ruairi Quinn will take over the finance portfolio, the first time it has not been held by the largest party. Democratic Left, the successor of the Official IRA when the Provisional IRA split to pursue the armed struggle in 1970, dropped its earlier insistence on two cabinet positions. The main points of the new government's agreed programme include moves to keep public borrowing below 3 per cent of gross national product; tax cuts for the low paid; a freeze on privatisation; a referendum on divorce; and a commitment to the Northern Ireland peace process. The breakthrough coincides with talks yesterday in Belfast between the British officials and loyalist paramilitaries. David Owen adds: In London, Mr Major said he was confident the new Dublin government would wish to 'sustain together the work we have done over Northern Ireland'.

With more than 300 delegates gathering for the largest business conference since the troubles began 25 years ago, Sinn Fein confirmed that its party councillors would be attending today's working sessions. The decision followed a meeting in Londonderry between Mr Brown and Mr Mitchel McLaughlin, the organisation's northern chairman. Mr McLaughlin insisted that the party, which had threatened to boycott the conference, had always said it would attend. As Mr John Major, the prime minister, launched the event by seeking to highlight the province's investment potential, the British and US governments signed a science and technology agreement to give Northern Ireland companies access to US technology and production techniques. Separately, British Telecommunications and US chemicals group DuPont were poised to announce new investment projects for the province totalling Pounds 36m. Speaking after a meeting with Mr Brown, Mr Major told delegates they could be in at the beginning of 'a very exciting phase' in the province. He said he was not asking potential investors to be 'less than hard-headed' about their business decisions but simply to 'recognise that there is a society bursting with the desire to succeed'. He said he hoped strong pressure to 'make peace irreversible' would come from outside Northern Ireland. Mr Brown said the US would work with the people of Northern Ireland 'to replace the architecture of violence'. He said the US was drawing up a strategic plan for Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic's border counties which he would present to the White House Conference for Trade and Investment in Ireland in April. However, he announced no new plans for US government investment in the province. He said the US would 'seek to harness the effort and expense of hatred and security; to build with it an economy on which opportunity overshadows enmity; and create an infrastructure that will support a new era of reconciliation'. Mr Brown also said the US Trade and Development Agency was to lead a technical delegation to the province to identify projects 'that represent more mutually beneficial opportunities'.

0,FT934-11034 ,"FT934-11034 _AN-DKCDEAAKFT 931103   FT  03 NOV 93 / Ulster peace talks may proceed without Paisley      By DAVID OWEN and KEVIN BROWN   THE BRITISH government is to press ahead with plans to put forward its own proposals for a lasting peace in Northern Ireland even if Mr Ian Paisley's hardline Democratic Unionist Party decides not to return to the negotiating table. Ministers' determination to proceed irrespective of possible DUP objections emerged last night as Mr John Major, the prime minister, confirmed he will shortly meet the leaders of all four constitutional Northern Ireland parties  -including Mr Paisley - for bilateral talks. The meeting with Mr Paisley, who yesterday spelt out two conditions for rejoining the talks, will focus on the DUP's proposals for 'breaking the logjam' and consequently is not regarded at Westminster as part of the formal process. News of the fresh round of talks came on the eve of today's Anglo-Irish conference in Belfast, which will try to put renewed impetus behind the government's efforts. The detail of Mr Major's proposals is not expected to become clear for some time and may initially be presented to those participating in the talks in further bilateral sessions and in private. The plan is, however, believed to focus on the establishment of a Northern Ireland assembly and the revitalisation of local government, which has been moribund since the imposition of direct rule in 1974. Downing Street said Mr Major would begin seeing Northern Ireland political leaders tomorrow. The first meetings are expected to be with Dr John Alderdice, leader of the moderate unionist Alliance party, and Mr John Hume, leader of the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party. The prime minister's office is trying to arrange meetings with Mr Paisley and Mr James Molyneaux, leader of the Ulster Unionist party, the biggest unionist grouping. It follows the prime minister's decision to accept a request for a meeting from Mr Hume, who wants to discuss his talks on prospects for peace with Mr Gerry Adams, head of Sinn Fein. Mr Paisley yesterday insisted Mr Hume must end his meetings with Mr Adams, before the DUP would re-enter talks. 'And until Dublin deals with Articles 2 and 3 (of its constitution which covers its claim to the North), there is no point in sitting down with them,' he added.

Ireland's President Mary Robinson has been invited to London for tea with the Queen. Buckingham Palace did not announce next Thursday's visit, but it confirmed leaks from Dublin. It will be a private visit, a courtesy call, a palace official said yesterday. There is no question of a state occasion. The Queen went to Germany last year, hoping to heal wounds of the second world war. She visited Spain in 1988, shrugging off the UK's territorial dispute over Gibraltar. In the US, once a British colony, the Queen draws crowds. The French have been known to wave flags for her. But historical divisions between Britain and Ireland live on. No British king or queen has met an Irish president. The last monarch to visit southern Ireland was Edward VII in 1903 - almost 20 years before the partitioning of Ulster and the creation of an Irish Free State. Next week's visit illustrates the improvement in UK-Irish government relations which - even as late as the 1980s - were punctuated by ill-tempered outbursts over the extradition of Irish terrorists, or the quality of British justice. The neighbourliness is not reflected, however, in Northern Ireland. Yesterday local election results in the province set back hopes of Irish and British ministers that 'round-table' political talks on the province's political future would be re-started soon. The better-than-expected performance of the Rev Ian Paisley's hard-line Democratic Unionist party will only encourage him in his pledge not to resume negotiations until Ireland compromises on its territorial claim on the north. Also faring well was Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA which is excluded from talks by both the Irish and the British governments. The territorial dispute over Northern Ireland remains the unofficial reason why diplomats in London and Dublin continue to advise their respective heads of state against a formal meeting. But there are, perhaps, personal memories too; the Queen's cousin Lord Mountbatten was murdered by the IRA in 1979.

In his first substantial speech of the new year on the initiative, the Irish prime minister insisted that majority consent in Northern Ireland was essential for any peace settlement. But in a passage aimed at Sinn Fein leaders - who have deman-ded clarification of last month's Downing Street declaration be-fore passing judgment on it - Mr Reynolds made it clear he thought the scope of the so-called 'unionist veto' was limited. 'It is important to note that the requirement for the consent of a majority is related . . . to the constitutional issue,' he said. 'It does not mean that all forms of political progress or other decisions by the two governments are subject to a similar block.' Sinn Fein has argued that the veto has been able to block political progress in the past and would continue to do so under the terms of the peace initiative. Mr Reynolds' remarks came as Lord Callaghan, the former Labour prime minister, added his voice to calls for London to provide Sinn Fein with the clarification it has requested. But Lord Callaghan - who, as home secretary, sent the first British troops into Northern Ireland in 1969 - said the government was right not to negotiate with the IRA alone. Separately, Mr James Molyneaux, the Ulster Unionist leader, predicted that talks between Mr Michael Ancram, the Northern Ireland minister, and the province's four constitutional parties could lead to an elected assembly for Ulster by the end of the year. As unionist politicians hardened their rhetoric, Mr Molyneaux predicted that the IRA and Sinn Fein would reject the joint declaration and said Mr John Major, the prime minister, was right not to offer clarification. The document was set out in plain English. He could see no reason why even those of 'limited intelligence' could not understand it. A joint Army and police base at Crossmaglen, South Armagh, was rocked by an explosion early today. Two soldiers were believed to have been injured in the attack.

The Northern Ireland secretary had been criticised for singing on an Irish television chat show on Friday only hours after an IRA bomb killed seven civilians in Tyrone. The prime minister, speaking on a visit to Northern Ireland, expressed full confidence in Mr Brooke. But the incident appeared last night to have undermined efforts to start political talks on the future of the province. Amid bizarre scenes at Westminster, Mr Brooke won warm and almost unqualified support from Labour and Tory backbenchers for his honourable stance, but he is believed at Westminster to be unlikely to survive in his present post beyond the general election. He created confusion with his resignation offer, which he made public at the end of a Commons statement on the latest IRA bombing. Not until some hours later did Downing Street announce that it had been rejected. Mr Major described Mr Brooke as a 'very good friend of peace in Northern Ireland. . . He has more work to do yet.' Mr Major visited one of the workers injured in the blast during a Belfast tour and promised that the killers would be 'hunted, hunted, and hunted for the rest of their days'. Last night he and Mr Brooke spent two hours in talks with Unionist MPs on security in the province and agreed to consider some proposals, believed to include a citizens' militia and the cordoning of Catholic areas. Heading the Unionist delegation was the Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionist Party - the most prominent among those who called for Mr Brooke's resignation for appearing on the Late Late Show in Dublin. Mr Paisley did not rule out meeting Mr Brooke again, but said Unionists would 'consider very carefully' whether to take part in further 'talks about talks' on the future of the province. Mr Paisley said confidence in Mr Brooke had been 'irretrievably damaged', adding that the minister had, in effect, 'danced on the graves' of the IRA's victims. Among others, Mr Brooke is likely to have lost considerable respect for appearing to cower to DUP demands by offering his resignation. During the Irish television show, Mr Brooke expressed outrage at the attack and sympathy for the victims' families. He declined a request to sing 'Danny Boy', but bowed to the insistence of Mr Gay Byrne, the show's host, and sang 'Oh My Darling Clementine'. Northern Ireland Office officials had argued that to change his programme on Friday would have been to allow the IRA to set the agenda. In the Commons, Mr Brooke apologised for his 'error', which he insisted was 'innocent in intent'. As he spoke, Tory MPs shouted 'no, no, no'. Mr Kevin McNamara, Labour's Northern Ireland spokesman, praised Mr Brooke's 'characteristically honest and courageous statement'. Mr Brooke offered his resignation during Mr Major's trip to Belfast but urged the prime minister not to upset his itinerary to make a decision. Downing Street stressed that Mr Brooke had acted 'entirely honourably' and said the people of Northern Ireland would respect his stand, recognising 'the depth of his contrition'. In Dublin, Mr Gerry Collins, Irish foreign minister, backed Mr Brooke and looked forward to seeing him 'very shortly'. An Anglo-Irish conference meeting is expected next week. RTE, the Irish state television station, made a public apology to Mr Brooke. It said that: 'RTE would very much regret if the (interview) should damage in any way Mr Brooke's work or cause his resignation . . . it was an error to have invited Mr Brooke to sing and any offence which may have been caused is very much regretted'.

However, few of them stay on to play a part in revitalising the country's most economically depressed region. While pupils in Northern Ireland achieve higher marks than pupils elsewhere at A-level, one third of those who go on to higher education each year do so, not in local universities, but in the rest of Britain. 'Many of them are our science and technology 'high fliers' and many do not come home to pursue their careers and play their part in economic regeneration and social progress,' Lord Grey of Naunton, Chancellor of the University of Ulster, said at a summer graduation ceremony this year. 'This is our own 'brain drain' and is not something which Northern Ireland - which relies so much on its indigenous human resources as opposed to mineral wealth - can afford,' he said. A recently qualified first class honours graduate at the ceremony summed up his feelings: 'There is limited scope for me in Ulster. I don't particularly want to leave the province but from a career point of view I've got little alternative. Obtaining a degree does not guarantee me anything.' Education standards compare favourably with those of England and Wales - 26.3 per cent of Ulster pupils achieved two or more A-levels in 1989/90 compared with 20.1 per cent in England and 17.4 per cent in Wales. Just over 27 per cent of 18-year-olds in Northern Ireland enter higher education compared to just over 19 per cent in the rest of Britain, according to figures for 1990/91. At the other end of the attainment spectrum, however, the position is disturbing. More pupils leave school without a qualification of any kind in Northern Ireland than in any other region of Britain. Roman Catholic teenagers are more likely to be in such a position. A report commissioned by the Standing Advisory Commission on Human Rights identified a 'significant minority' of Catholic schools where a high proportion of male school leavers are unqualified. The latest statistics show that almost 16 per cent of Catholics leaving have no qualifications. Social and economic disadvantage allied to low self-esteem have been cited as possible factors in the poor performance. Two new Catholic schools are to be built in Belfast and Londonderry at a cost of Pounds 8m. The schools will provide 15,000 places and will address the shortage of places for Catholic pupils. Education in Northern Ireland is undergoing radical change with the reforms reflecting the particular needs of the province. The government encourages educating Protestant and Roman Catholic children together, although it is not policy to impose integrated schools on parents. Several integrated schools at primary and secondary level have been set up and more are in the pipeline but, while an important area, it remains small in terms of total pupil enrollment. The aim of the reform programme in Northern Ireland is to provide a system which can raise standards and give parents a wider choice. Unlike the rest of the UK, Northern Ireland maintains the 11-Plus tests whereby a place in grammar or secondary school depends largely on a pupil's performance in two of mental agility tests. The new examination structure marks a shift towards continual assessment and will test children at the ages of eight, 11 and 14. It means that next year thousands of Ulster children will face a three day examination on top of the controversial 11-Plus tests. Primary seven pupils will be sitting new exams in English, maths and science in February, just three months after the 11-Plus tests. While the 1993 tests are a dummy run before they become official in the 1993/94 school year and replace the 11-Plus, educationalists have voiced fears that, if the results of the new tests differ substantially from the 11-Plus exams, public confidence in the new system will be undermined. While anything which does away with the pass-or-fail syndrome system of the 11-Plus will be generally welcomed, teachers unions argue that, if the assessment is to be completed within working hours, it will be at the expense of teaching pupils. Teachers, they say, are already overstretched, under-valued and leaving the profession in large numbers. But the government says the changes will help maintain Northern Ireland's reputation for good quality education. Current education spending, at just over Pounds 1bn a year, represents a rise of 21 per cent in real terms over the past 10 years. However, the IRA's campaign has thrown up added problems for many schools. Last year the cost of criminal damage and injury claims arising from concerted bombing attacks on commercial targets led to a moratorium on public spending. Although the temporary spending freeze was lifted in April, a number of important school projects were delayed.  The Financial Times   London Page 15  "

The raid on Monday was at a cash-holding centre run by Allied Irish Banks at Waterford in the Irish Republic. The republic's Central Bank holds cash reserves there to provide liquidity to regional banks or to absorb their surpluses on a day-to-day basis. The centre is one of five in the Republic operated either by Allied Irish Banks or Bank of Ireland as agents of the Central Bank. Police said the raid was carried out with military precision by five men armed with an automatic rifle and handguns. They spent only five minutes in forcing staff to open a vault, loading the cash into a stolen van and making their getaway. They had apparently earlier broken through the cement roof of the building. Shots were fired, but no-one was injured. The getaway van was found abandoned yesterday in a lane a few miles north of Waterford, where it is thought the robbers transferred to another car with a Northern Ireland number plate. The police said the IRA was the main suspect, although there was 'no hard proof'. The IRA usually keeps a low profile in the republic, and does not claim responsibility for its actions as it does in Northern Ireland. The IRA is not thought to have been active in armed robberies in the republic since 1990. But a security crackdown on its racketeering in Northern Ireland over the past year is believed to have helped cut the estimated Pounds 6m raised each year to finance IRA operations. Irish police and banking chiefs met yesterday to review security procedures at other cash-holding centres in the republic. Mr Peter Brooke, Northern Ireland secretary, yesterday met unionist leaders who called for troop reinforcements for the province. Mr James Molyneaux and the Rev Ian Paisley described the meeting at the Stormont parliament building as 'meaningful and constructive'.

A draft position paper leaked to an Irish newspaper confirmed Dublin's intention to drop its territorial claim over Northern Ireland and acknowledged there could be no change in the province's status without the consent of a majority of the population. But in return it sought British acknowledgement of the legitimacy of the goal of Irish unity 'by agreement' and consent to a marked extension of Dublin's role in the province. This would be exercised through a strengthened Anglo-Irish inter-governmental conference and new north-south institutions with executive powers. The leak  - coming just a day after Mr John Major, the prime minister, reinforced his personal commitment to a settlement  - embarrassed the Irish government and annoyed Downing Street. Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, quickly disassociated himself from the paper, whose authenticity was confirmed by the Irish foreign ministry. Mr Reynolds said no such document had been presented to the Dublin government. The paper had 'no connection whatso-ever' with the peace initiative. Neither Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, nor Downing Street would comment yesterday on the substance of the document. But the interventionist tone of some proposals would almost certainly be unacceptable to London. There also seems little prospect of Downing Street agreeing to an inter-governmental body with powers as wide-ranging as Dublin envisages or to entrust the proposed north-south institutions with developing an integrated approach to the European Union. Unionists were yesterday already balking at the paper's emphasis on 'enhancing' the co-operative structures of the 1985 Anglo-Irish agreement. Mr Ken Maginnis, security spokesman for the Ulster Unionist party, said it was 'presumptuous' for Dublin to take such a 'divisive' approach to a delicate problem. The Reverend Ian Paisley, leader of the hardline Democratic Unionist party, said: 'We are moving to Mark Two of the Anglo-Irish agreement.' The two governments did not want to 'consult the people' at all. 'Until we deal with Articles 2 and 3 (of the Irish constitution which lay claim to Northern Ireland) there can be no progress.' Sir Patrick said the paper was 'not a document we have received' and it would be futile for him to speculate on it. The Northern Ireland secretary met briefly with Mr Reynolds and Mr John Hume, leader of the Social Democratic and Labour Party, at a conference in Londonderry. Mr Hume said he would shortly meet Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, to brief him on his recent talks with Mr Major.

But praise for the Downing Street Declaration from across the political spectrum was matched by initial 'disappointment' from Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, and condemnation from hardline unionists. In a joint statement establishing the framework for a permanent political settlement, Mr John Major and Mr Albert Reynolds heralded an historic opportunity for 'a new beginning' in the province. The prime ministers pledged to accelerate all-party talks designed to restore devolved government to Northern Ireland province and to intensify co-operation between Belfast and Dublin. Mr Major invited Sinn Fein to join the talks process within three months of an end to violence. Speaking at a joint press conference with Mr Reynolds, he said the declaration 'closes no doors except the door to violence and illegality. And crucially it opens the door to those who abandon violence'. Speaking directly to the IRA, Mr Reynolds added: 'This offers you an historic opportunity to come into the political process.' He said Dublin would establish an all-Ireland Forum to which Sinn Fein would be invited after a cessation of terrorism. In a television broadcast across the UK last night, Mr Major said: 'We cannot go on spilling blood in the name of the past . . . the time to choose peace is long overdue.' Aides of both leaders were privately voicing hopes that the IRA's traditional Christmas ceasefire, due to start shortly, could turn into a permanent cessation of violence. But Mr Major and Mr Reynolds admitted that while they hoped for peace, the initiative now lay with the IRA. The declaration, entrenching the unionist veto over constitutional change in Northern Ireland but balancing it with explicit recognition of the possibility of a united Ireland, won grudging acquiescence from the Ulster Unionists. Mr James Molyneaux, Ulster Unionist leader, asked a series of pointed questions about the statement but refrained from open criticism. Later, he said there were parts of the declaration the UUP did not accept. But the party had set its reservations aside 'for the time being' to see what effect the document had on the IRA. The initiative was praised by Mr John Hume, the leader of the mainly Catholic SDLP. Mr Hume said that he intended to resume his talks with Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, in an attempt to encourage a total cessation of violence. But Mr Ian Paisley, leader of the hardline Democratic Unionists, condemned the agreement as a 'sell-out' to the IRA and an 'act of treachery' by Mr Major. In Sinn Fein's first reaction, a leading member said there was general 'disappointment' among nationalists, but Mr Mitchel McLaughlin, the party chairman, said it would be studying the joint declaration in depth. In the House of Commons, Mr Major won plaudits from opposition leaders and Conservative MPs alike for what was variously described as a 'brave' and 'imaginative' initiative. In an attempt to maintain the support of the Ulster Unionists, the prime minister insisted repeatedly that the province's status would be changed only with the consent of a majority of its citizens. He said the declaration 'guarantees that for so long as a majority of the people of Northern Ireland wish to remain a part of the UK, the government will uphold their right to do so. That pledge remains 'rock-solid'. But in the hope of coaxing Sinn Fein to the negotiating table, Mr Major ceded significant ground to Mr Reynolds in agreeing language designed to appeal to Irish nationalists. The declaration makes clear that the British government will do nothing to stand in the way of Irish unity and will consider the establishment of cross-border institutions to strengthen cross-border links. Adapting nationalist rhetoric, it said that the people of Ireland alone should map out their own future through 'self-determination on the basis of consent, freely and concurrently given, north and south'. Mr Reynolds moved further than previous Irish leaders in offering explicit recognition that the status of Northern Ireland could only be changed with the consent of its people. He told journalists in Downing Street: 'We cannot have winners and losers if we want peace.' Mr Reynolds, who won a standing ovation in the Dail after returning to Dublin last night, also gave a commitment that the Irish government would drop its constitutional claim to Northern Ireland as part of an overall political settlement.

The Irish government has responded with annoyance to an interview with Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, in the Daily Telegraph yesterday in which he emphasised that the republic's territorial claim to the province was the central issue to be resolved in drafting a joint 'framework document' aimed at encouraging Northern Ireland's parties to return to the negotiating table. An Irish government spokesman emphasised that any new constitutional arrangement for the province had to be 'balanced'. He said: 'What we are seeking is a balanced constitutional accommodation as expressed in the (Downing Street) declaration, not some constitutional one-way street.' Last Friday in Brussels Mr John Major and Mr Albert Reynolds, the British and Irish prime ministers, agreed to postpone a planned July summit until the autumn to allow more time for differences to be resolved. The political situation in the province is expected to be high on the agenda, with security, when Mr Major meets Mr James Molyneaux, the Ulster Unionist party leader, and other senior UUP figures in London today. The meeting was portrayed at Westminster last night as the latest in a series of discussions with leaders of the province's main political parties. Mr Major met Mr John Hume, leader of the mainly Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party, last week. A meeting with Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the hardline Democratic Unionist party, is understood to have been pencilled in for July 26. Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, said yesterday that he was 'surprised' at the comments attributed to Sir Patrick and did not agree that the republic's territorial claim was the central issue. He said a 'number of issues remain to be resolved, and all of those will have to be resolved together'. The Irish government has emphasised that the 1920 Government of Ireland Act, the basis of Westminster's rule over Northern Ireland, should be modified as a quid pro quo for modifying the claim. Mr Dermot Ahern, a prominent backbencher of Mr Reynolds' Fianna Fail party and co-chairman of the Anglo-Irish joint parliamentary body, yesterday accused Sir Patrick of trying to 'cherry-pick' aspects of last December's Downing Street declaration.

They believe Sinn Fein, the political wing of the provisional IRA, will have to be drawn into talks once it has renounced violence to make a political settlement possible. Interviews over the past week with executives at the top 50 companies in Northern Ireland found most broadly support London and Dublin's efforts to reach a settlement. They warned that failure would risk an upsurge of violence with damaging consequences for the economy. A number of the province's leading businessmen believe that an eventual unification of Ireland could be acceptable if there are economic and business dividends from a peace settlement. Business leaders in Northern Ireland have traditionally been reluctant to be drawn into the political debate for fear of becoming targets of terrorist attacks. Their decision to break their silence underlines the importance attached to peace efforts at a time when businesses are threatened by terrorism on the one hand and recession on the other. Sir George Quigley, chairman of Ulster Bank, said: 'The two governments should work closely together and all concerned grasp the sense of urgency . . . there is a need to act now and not just drift for another 12 months which would lead to a repetition of the violence of the last 25 years. This is a turning-point.' Mr Edward Wilson, managing director of Ulster Carpets, said there was a great desire for peace. 'I would be quite happy as an industrialist to work in a united Ireland or within the UK . . . given the right political institutions and the right economic support from the EC, there is no reason why Ireland should not operate as a single political and economic entity.' Mr Trevor Campbell, managing director of Moy Park, a leading food processor, commented: 'No one is in any doubt that a cessation of violence would help the economic climate generally. I don't want a temporary ceasefire but a permanent one. If the government can get a devolved administration in Northern Ireland, this will help business.' Mr Georges Senninger, managing director of Montupet, a French motor components company based in Belfast, said: 'Every time we try and sell something the 'troubles' factor comes into play. The IRA is part of the landscape here, you have to take them into account. I don't think it is possible to have a political settlement without them.' Mr Alex Bell, director of Castlecourt Investments, which runs Belfast's main shopping centre, said: 'The government is totally on the right track by trying to bring about a settlement, although we cannot have peace at any price. It is inevitable that Sinn Fein will be included in the political process . . . but there is an essential criterion prior to that happening. This would involve the complete cessation of violence.' Mr Sean O'Dwyer, chief executive of Desmond and Sons, a Londonderry clothing manufacturer employing 2,700 people and the second biggest manufacturer in the province, agreed that Sinn Fein would have to be at the negotiating table 'but only after a cessation of violence'. Mr Ian Young, managing director of a Derry electrical contractor, said: 'I believe a united Ireland will eventually come about. Unionists should be negotiating from a position of strength now, to get the best possible terms and guarantees. Politicians are going to have to grasp the nettle and all will get stung.'

This indication of the gulf that still separates participants in the political talks on the province's future emerged at Westminster yesterday as London and Dublin sought to maintain pressure on republican leaders to make a positive response to the Downing Street declaration. Northern Ireland secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew said in Omagh that Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, was lagging behind public opinion. It faced 'only one rational choice' in accepting the joint declaration. This message was supported by Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, who said he believed the Northern Ireland secretary had recently given enough clarification to clear up any outstanding matters. Mr Reynolds said in Dublin that he hoped Sinn Fein would give a positive response as soon as possible. It emerged at Westminster that the government is taking fresh soundings from MPs about the functioning of its ban on broadcasting the voices of Northern Ireland terrorists or their supporters - less than two weeks after announcing restrictions would stay in place. Last Sunday's television interview with Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, on ITV's Walden programme is understood to have heightened concerns that the ban can work in the terrorists' favour by allowing their words to be spoken by actors while ruling out aggressive questioning. It is thought highly unlikely that a move to lift the restrictions would come before Sinn Fein's annual conference later this month. Such a move would face stiff resistance at Westminster. Downing Street said it did not think there were any 'present plans' for a change. The UUP proposals - to be published this month - focus mainly on the internal government of the province. They are expected to flesh out the 'blueprint for stability' proposed by Mr James Molyneaux, the UUP leader, last March. The UUP is to send a delegation to the US later this year for talks with politicians and business people. The decision follows the highly publicised visit last month to the US by Mr Adams.

The decision to relieve Brigadier Tom Longland of his duties as commander of the Armagh-based 3 Brigade was taken before the incidents earlier this month in Coalisland, the MoD said. The brigadier, who had completed only five months of his two-year posting, was replaced last Wednesday. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, told BBC Radio's Today programme: 'I am quite clear in my own mind that the incidents which took place in Coalisland were not relevant to that particular decision.' In spite of Mr Rifkind's words, Northern Ireland politicians were united in seeing a connection between the brigadier's departure and the incidents. It is likely to be raised in today's plenary session of the talks that resumed earlier this month between Northern Ireland party leaders on the political future of the province. Mr Seamus Mallon, deputy leader of the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party, said he suspected the brigadier had come into conflict with the police over their primary role in maintaining security. Mr David Trimble, Ulster Unionist MP for Upper Bann, said it was unfortunate that the brigadier's removal would be seen as a result of pressure from the Irish government. The Army is awaiting the outcome of police investigations into the two Coalisland incidents, in which members of the 3rd Battalion, the Parachute Regiment, allegedly rampaged through bars and, in a subsequent clash, fired shots into a crowd, injuring three people. A junior officer in the battalion was suspended from duty after the first incident. The battalion is due to leave Northern Ireland shortly. It was sent in April on a temporary basis to replace one of the reinforcement units deployed in the province after an outbreak of violence late last year.  The Financial Times   London Page 8  "

Speaking ahead of a meeting in London this weekend with John  Major, he again highlighted hopes that their peace initiative  would prompt a permanent end to Northern Ireland-linked  terrorism.    Mr Reynolds told the Irish parliament he was still  ""cautiously optimistic"" about the success prospects of the  two-month-old joint declaration.    The Irish premier, who meets Mr Major before the two leaders  attend Saturday's Twickenham rugby international between England  and Ireland, said they would be reviewing recent Northern  Ireland political developments. Northern Ireland Secretary Sir  Patrick Mayhew and Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring -- joint  chairmen of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference -- will  also be at the talks.    Mr Reynolds said the meeting would focus primarily on issues  connected with the peace declaration. ""We will review progress,  share assessments of the current position and examine approaches  of attaining our common objective of a lasting peace with  justice in Ireland.""    He said the advancement of political dialogue through a  resumed inter-party talks process would be discussed too.    Mr Reynolds refused to agree that Sinn Fein's annual  conference at the end of this month would signal the deadline  for its response to the peace bid.    Mr Reynolds is due to go to the U.S. for a period including  St Patrick's Day, March 17, when he will meet President Clinton.  He said he would ""avail of every appropriate opportunity to  present and promote in a balanced way the complexities of the  Northern Ireland conflict, as well as our efforts towards its  peaceful resolution.

In their joint Anglo-Irish declaration, launched two months ago, they held out the explicit possibility of eventual unification of the two halves of Ireland, if that was what the people of Ireland wanted. But the essential pre-condition for setting this initiative in motion was that the IRA terrorists must first declare a ceasefire. That precondition has not been met. The IRA has not rejected the offer; but the fact that it has not stopped the bombing and shooting suggests that a permanent ceasefire is not very likely. The UK and Irish prime ministers meet next week to see where they go from here; it looks as though they need to think again. The rationale for the December declaration was a belief that the IRA was tired out after 25 years of fruitless terrorism, and might give up. Yet even if the terrorists are tired, it requires great faith to conclude that they can now be converted to democracy. And even if most of the terrorists were prepared to give up, Whitehall officials seem to fear that they may be held hostage by the out-and-out extremists. If the IRA does not agree to give up terrorism, the two governments must rethink their initiative from top to bottom. Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, has said Britain will press ahead with new moves, including devolved local government in the province; perhaps it may. But a political process that leaves out the hard republicans, and perhaps the hard unionists, will be a meagre affair beside the comprehensive agenda of the December declaration. Yet the strategic position may be less bleak than it looks, because various parts of the truth are now being made plain. First, the declaration gives explicit recognition not just to the undeniable old fact, that Northern Ireland is historically and geographically part of Ireland, but also to the new political fact, that its future will be decided not in London but in Ireland. In the introduction to the declaration, the two governments say their aim is 'a new political framework founded on consent'; and a purely British passage says 'it is for the people of Ireland alone, by agreement between the two parts respectively, to exercise their right of self-determination, on the basis of consent, if that is their wish'. Neither passage can give any comfort to rightwing nationalists at Westminster, let alone to die-hard unionists among Northern Irish Protestants. Such an explicit recognition by the UK of the legitimacy of the claims of Irish unity (though only by consent) is unprecedented. But the corollary of the principle of consent is that terrorism, so far from advancing the cause of Irish unity, makes it impossible. The very premise of terrorism is a denial of democracy, the total negation of consent. In Northern Ireland, the two communities are too evenly balanced to admit of a victory of one over the other. IRA terrorism cannot lead to a political victory for the nationalists, because the immediate consequence would be more terrorism by extremist Protestants, most probably a civil war. If the leaders of the IRA were to take up the offer of 'reconciliation, leading to a new political framework', that would be wonderful; but it may be too much of a miracle to hope for. If they do not, then the IRA and Sinn Fein will both be politically dead meat. If they reject the opportunities offered by the declaration, they will have forfeited their claim to speak for the people of Ireland; and they will have shown that terrorism takes precedence over politics, and that Sinn Fein is ruled by the IRA, not the other way round. But whether the IRA says yes or no, the central problem in the declaration is with the definition of the concept of consent. The reason for the terrorism by Catholics and Protestants is that consent is lacking; and even if the terrorism stopped, consent would still be lacking. In fact, there is never likely to be, in our lifetimes, the kind of political majority, either for keeping or for changing the constitutional status quo, which could be counted on to produce a permanent and peaceful settlement of the Northern Ireland question. The corollary is that the medium-term future of Northern Ireland will be decided not by local parties or local majorities, but by agreement between the governments of Britain and Ireland. Sir Patrick Mayhew professes to rule out any idea of joint authority over Northern Ireland; but in strategic terms, that is precisely what is implied by the Anglo-Irish declaration. When the two governments say their aim is 'a new political framework, within Northern Ireland, for the whole island, and between these islands', they are talking about shared authority, almost a de facto condominium. One detailed study* has argued for a de jure condominium, through an Anglo-Irish treaty. This would be an extraordinary innovation in constitutional practice, and would have difficulties with the old-timers in the House of Commons. But it would make logical sense, because it would rule out, for ever, the only grounds for terrorism: the hope of total victory by one community at the expense of the other. And it could also make a creative political contribution to the development of interstate relationships in the context of the European Union. But if London dare not admit the reality of condominium, at least let us have no more talk of self-determination. We have seen what it has achieved in former Yugoslavia, and we do not need that kind of self-determination in Northern Ireland. *Northern Ireland: Sharing Authority, by O'Leary, Lyne, Marshall  Rowthorn, IPPR, 30 Southampton St, London WC2.

At a meeting of the Anglo-Irish conference in Belfast, both sides insisted that the various exchanges between the parties over the last two years had been valuable in producing a basis for political dialogue. Mr Peter Brooke, Northern Ireland secretary, and Mr Gerry Collins, Irish foreign affairs minister, said they hoped the potential for talks would be developed at the appropriate time. Asked about his own future, Mr Brooke said not only his commitment but also his enjoyment of the affairs of Northern Ireland had been made consistently clear. Security matters dominated the agenda with the Irish government expressing concern over the case of Mr Brian Nelson, a former Army agent awaiting sentence in Belfast for terrorist offences committed while he was a member of a loyalist paramilitary organisation. Nelson admitted several offences last week arising from an investigation by Mr John Stevens, Cambridgeshire deputy chief constable, into allegations of collusion between loyalist paramilitary groups and elements of the security forces. Ministers condemned the murder of eight Protestant construction workers by the IRA near Cookstown earlier this month and reaffirmed their rejection of any attempt to promote political objectives by violence. Both sides reaffirmed their commitment to cross-border security. The use of lethal force by the security forces and police accompaniment of soldiers on patrol were also discussed.

Downing Street said Mr John Major, the prime minister, who has been kept closely informed about the shootings, would not be diverted by the gunmen. Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, said terrorists had to be prevented from dictating the political agenda in the province. He added: 'Last night's slaughter of the innocents puts more pressure on us to accelerate our efforts to find a formula for the cessation of violence and get the constitutional parties back around a negotiating table. 'One of our major problems is the lack of a political process and dialogue. Consequently the men of violence are allowed to take centre stage, and that has to be addressed immediately.' The London-Dublin initiative was condemned by Mr Peter Robinson, deputy leader of the hardline Democratic Unionist party, who said it was part of the 'nationalist agenda'. He said the initiative had 'raised the temperature' in the province. 'We are only half a step away from Northern Ireland being out of control. If the violence continues like this the ordinary man is going to take sides for protection.' However, there was widespread support for the governments' determination to press ahead. Mr Kevin McNamara, Britain's shadow Northern Ireland secretary, said the killings were 'absolutely horrendous'. It was 'urgent that full attention should be paid to the Major-Reynolds initiative to find a solution which will respect the integrity of both communities and to establish institutions which can be useful both to the people of Northern Ireland and to the people of Ireland'. Mr Seamus Mallon, deputy leader of the nationalist SDLP, said the shootings were 'another bloody milestone in the move towards peaceful resolution of the problems here'. Dr Robin Eames, the Anglican primate of all Ireland, said he did not believe that the joint statement by Mr Reynolds and Mr Major had prompted the killings. 'Obviously people's minds will centre on the reaction to the recent inter-governmental announcement, but my experience is that these terrorists, whoever they are, don't have to look for a reason,' he said. 'This is psychopathic blood-letting and their so-called banner of 'For God and Ulster' on the one side and 'For a united Ireland' on the other are now irrelevant to most people.' Mr Martin McGuinness, vice-president of Sinn Fein, said the murders were a brutal reminder of the conflict in Northern Ireland. He urged the nationalist community to remain calm and vigilant. Mr Philip McGarry, chairman of the Alliance party, said the shootings were 'a disgraceful landmark'. He called on people to support the security forces.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

The survey--being detailed in tomorrow's Irish Independent  newspaper and on BBC TV's On the Record--coincides with this  weekend's Sinn Fein annual conference in Dublin.    It also highlighted large support for a security crackdown  on  all para-military groups if the terrorism continues.    The poll was carried out last Wednesday in the Irish  Republic  by Irish Marketing Surveys and on Wednesday and Thursday in  Northern Ireland by Ulster Marketing Surveys.    It came at the height of growing speculation over the timing  of the long-expected response of the IRA and their Sinn Fein  spokesmen to the Downing Street peace declaration.    Earlier tonight, Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams made it  clear in his keynote speech to the party conference that more  time was required for consultations about the joint Anglo-Irish  declaration.    The cross-border survey showed a 79 percent endorsement of  the principle in the Downing Street declaration that it would be  wrong to impose a united Ireland in the absence of the  freely-given consent of a majority of people in Northern Ireland.    And an all-Ireland figure of 76 percent--80 percent in the  Republic and 68 percent in Northern Ireland--supported the  decision of the London and Dublin governments to go ahead with  new inter-party talks on Ulster's future, given that the  republican movement has so far failed to reply to the peace  statement.    Of those questioned on the southern side of the border, 94  percent agreed with calls on the IRA and Sinn Fein to renounce  violence.    In Northern Ireland the figure was 85 percent--87 percent of  the Province's Protestants and 82 percent of the Catholics.    The security clampdown was supported by an average 75  percent  in the two parts of Ireland. In Ulster the move was backed by  88 percent of the Protestants and 61 percent of the Catholics.    Adults over the age of 18 took part in the survey--1,053 in  the Irish Republic and 863 in Northern Ireland, reflecting  population and other factors.     "

Mr Tim Sainsbury, the industry minister, said in a Commons written answer yesterday that Northern Ireland would receive Pounds 1.04bn, with Pounds 690m going to Merseyside and Pounds 260m to the Highlands and Islands. EC ministers last week decided how to apportion the Community's structural funds between the 12 member states. The UK receives funds for Northern Ireland, Merseyside and the Highlands and Islands because the regional gross domestic product of these regions is 75 per cent or less than the EC average. The government has divided the Pounds 2bn according to population. Although there is no EC check on how the funds are spent, structural fund regulations commit the UK government to spend a sum which is at least 25 per cent of that provided by the EC and which is no less than the amount it has spent over the last five years. The poorest regions are classified 'Objective One' by the EC. A map of regions classified 'Objective Two', because they are suffering from industrial decline and are eligible for other EC structural funding, is being drawn up for publication in the autumn.

The court said the situation in Northern Ireland justified an exemption for Britain from a requirement under the European Human Rights Convention that suspects be brought 'promptly' to court. Judges voted 22-4 to reject a complaint by two Northern Irishmen who claimed their human rights were breached when they were arrested and held under the Prevention of Terrorism Act - one for six days, 14 hours and 30 minutes and one for four days, six hours and 25 minutes. The Prevention of Terrorism Act allows the home secretary to detain terrorist suspects for up to five days without charge. After being found guilty by the Human Rights Court in 1988 following a similar case, the government invoked an exemption under a convention provision which states that in time of war or 'other public emergency threatening the life of the nation' a government can be exempted from its obligations 'to the extent strictly required by the exigencies of the situation'. The judges effectively stated that the 'public emergency' in Northern Ireland was sufficient grounds for the government to take exceptional measures. The judges said that in the light of the 'extent and impact' of terrorist violence in Northern Ireland and elsewhere in the UK there was a 'public emergency'. After being found guilty of breaching human rights in 1988, the government either had to introduce new judicial measures or claim an exemption from its human rights obligations. There was no indication the exemption was 'other than a genuine response' to the terrorist situation.   Countries:-  QRZ  European Economic Community (EC).

Mr Michael Ancram, Northern Ireland minister, plans to use a new round of bilateral meetings to pave the way for the government to table its promised outline of the most likely route for reaching a settlement. The aim of the new round will be to gauge how the province's four constitutional parties can be coaxed closer to consensus on the form that devolution will take and how relations between Northern Ireland and Dublin are to be managed. The eventual outline would form a large part of the proposals promised by Mr John Major, the prime minister, in the Commons yesterday. One possibility would be the revival of an assembly for Northern Ireland with the rights of the Roman Catholic minority protected by mechanisms such as weighted majority voting and a right of appeal to Westminster. It is unlikely that any assembly would have powers to draft legislation, at least initially. It is unclear whether such an outline could secure the backing of the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party. Whitehall officials know they only have one chance to devise an outline that the parties would be prepared to use as a basis for negotiation if the prospects of a settlement are not to be set back. Mr Ancram's initiative follows his completion of a series of exploratory meetings at which the four constitutional parties mapped out their positions. The move underlines the government's determination to press on with the talks process in spite of doubts over the participation of the Rev Ian Paisley's hardline Democratic Unionist Party. The DUP has said it will not return to the talks until Mr John Hume, leader of the SDLP, calls a halt to his meetings with Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president. But DUP officials indicated privately this week that they had not ruled out further meetings with the government if they focused on the party's Breaking The Logjam peace plan. Mr Martin McGuinness of Sinn Fein yesterday insisted he had spoken with UK government representatives in a series of meetings ending last summer. He said he hoped the dialogue - which the government has bluntly denied - would be renewed 'now that the ice has been broken'.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

0,FT934-15848 ,"FT934-15848 _AN-DJJAIABOFT 931009   FT  09 OCT 93 / The Conservative Party Conference: Major stresses Tory commitment to Ulster      By ALISON SMITH and TIM COONE   MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday cemented his party's understanding with the Ulster unionists by re-emphasising the government's commitment to keeping Northern Ireland in the United Kingdom. His unequivocal statement came against a background of continuing uncertainty about the prospects for round-table talks on the future of Northern Ireland, which have been stalled since last November. Achieving the continuing support of the nine Ulster unionist MPs at Westminster would double the government's paper majority of just 17, leaving it much less vulnerable to backbench Tory rebellions on issues such as rail privatisation of the imposition of value added tax on domestic fuel. 'Northern Ireland is part of our democracy,' Mr Major said. 'We are not going to bargain away the people's democratic rights, in order to appease those who seek to rule by bullet or by bomb.' He was vigorously applauded as he insisted: 'No government which I lead will negotiate with those who perpetrate or those who support the use of violence.' Moderate nationalists are uneasy that the government may reward the Ulster unionists for their support on the critical Commons votes on the social chapter in July with changes such as a cross-party Westminster select committee on Northern Ireland. But the prospects of finding a solution also face other pressures. The hard-line Democratic Unionist party has ruled out further participation in the round-table talks process because of the initiative launched last month by Mr John Hume, the leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party, and Mr Gerry Adams, the leader of Sinn Fein. While the British government is doubtful that the Hume-Adams move will produce progress, Dublin seems more warmly disposed towards it. So long as the round-table talks have a chance of success, British government ministers do not intend to offer any concrete moves to the unionists. Instead, Mr Major hopes to keep the support of the party's MPs by emphasising the government's deep commitment to the Union - both he and Sir Norman Fowler pointedly referred to the Conservative and Unionist party - and contrasting that with Labour's policies. Yesterday he attacked Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, for allowing Mr Kevin McNamara, the Northern Ireland spokesman, 'to plan a united Ireland'. While Mr Ian Paisley, the DUP leader, responded yesterday by accusing Mr Major of 'trotting out all the usual Tory platitudes on Northern Ireland', the signs so far are that the Ulster unionists are more amenable to the government's approach. He said the DUP 'will be watching closely' the response of Mr Major and the Northern Ireland secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew to the Hume-Adams initiative which received a warm response in Dublin this week. Mr James Molyneaux, the Official Unionist party leader, told a fringe meeting this week that he saw no reason to end the life of the current parliament 'prematurely'. In Dublin, government reaction was low-key because no shift was detected away from Mr Major's previously stated policy positions.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

0,FT943-3204 ,"FT943-3204 _AN-EIOC7AC9FT 940915   FT  15 SEP 94 / Survey of Northern Ireland (4): Derry's high tech coup - Manufacturer's profile, Seagate      By JOHN MCMANUS   The quality of the labour force was the reason that US disc drive manufacturer Seagate chose Derry as the site for a Pounds 45m high-tech factory last year. 'The area offers a pool of well-educated, well-qualified and hence trainable labour,' explains Mr Michael Caulfield, the managing director of the plant. A chance meeting between Derry's nationalist MP, Mr John Hume and Seagate's Irish-American director and chief technical director, Dr Brendan Hegarty also 'could not but have helped put Derry on the short-list for possible sites,' admits Mr Caulfield. Northern Ireland has the twin distinctions of having among the highest educational standards in Britain and Ireland, and the worst levels of unemployment. Of the top 200 schools in the latest round of A-level results, 20 per cent were in Northern Ireland, explains the Belfast-born Mr Caulfield. Parts of Derry, however, where 13 per cent of the workforce are without a job. have some of the worst unemployment rates in Northern Ireland. Seagate's manufacturing strategy is to take every stage of the process of making disc drives and 'look at the amount of technology, capital and labour involved and ask what type of employee and what type of investment is needed,' explains Mr Caulfield. The company then decides on the most appropriate location for that stage of the process. This has resulted in labour-intensive assembly processes being located in South East Asia and until now, the technology and capital-intensive stages being located in the US. Derry was a very suitable choice for the location of the first facility for manufacturing the 'heads' which read the memory discs in the drives - the equivalent of the needle that plays the record in a record player - outside the US, explains Mr Caulfield. The head manufacturing process is extremely technology- and capital-intensive, using machines costing between Pounds 500,000 and Pounds 1.5m each. However, the machines require extremely competent and well-trained operators, as it is only through the use of human operators that the manufacturing process can be flexible enough to meet the demands of the computer industry - where product life cycles can be as short as nine months. Northern Ireland's development agency, the Industrial Development Board, offers some of the best capital grants in Europe - up to 50 per cent of capital expenditure. Just as importantly, in Seagate's case, generous assistance towards training and technological development are also available. 'Wherever we set up, there would have been a huge training load,' explains Mr Caulfield. The first 100 employees of the Derry plant had to spend three months training in the US, before the start of production in Derry. Further training will have to be carried out in Derry as new employees are recruited. The company has received grant assistance for this, on a level similar to the capital assistance given by the IDB, from the Training and Employment Agency. There has also been help from the Industrial Research and Technology Unit towards the establishment of a worldwide research and development centre in Derry and this 'will take Seagate's recording head technology into the next century,' explains Mr Caulfield. The factory, which commenced production in January, will produce 100m heads a year, half of Seagate's total production, by the end of 1995. This will give the company the ability to double revenues from the current level of around Dollars 3bn, explains Mr Caulfield. The heads, roughly two millimetres square, are manufactured in batches of around 6,000, neatly spaced out on ceramic squares about the size of a bathroom tile. The squares are shipped from Derry to Malaysia where they are sliced up into individual heads before being shipped to Thailand for mounting on the disc drive arms - the equivalent of record-player arms. The final assembly process takes place in Singapore, where the disc drives are assembled before shipment to computer manufactures for inclusion in their products. Seagate produces 200 different drives ranging from the small drives used in desktop PCs to the massive '30 gigabyte' drives used in supercomputers. Northern Ireland has seen multinationals come and go, resulting in a healthy scepticism about the real value of such high profile, high tech, highly mobile investment. The main and obvious benefit is the jobs that the factory will bring, believes Mr Caulfield. Seagate employs 200 people at the moment, and will employ 500 by 1996 and an additional 46 in the research and development centre. Around 100 employees are graduates, but the ratio of graduates to non-graduates will fall by the time the factory is fully operative. The age profile of employees is young, with Michael Caulfield being one of the oldest at only 44. All employees have at least A-level standard educations. Seagate will contribute Pounds 5m a year to the local economy in wages alone, but the amount of raw materials bought locally is limited. The bulk of the equipment and raw materials are sourced outside of Northern Ireland, with notable exceptions including some bulk chemicals and computers. Seagate is in Derry for the long term, says Mr Caulfield, who points to the worldwide research and development base as proof. It is an investment in people and the return period is at least 5 years, he says, adding: 'You don't invest in a worldwide research and development centre unless you are here to stay.'

What are the long-term political objectives of the British government in relation to Ireland? On what basis does the unionist veto exist, and how far does it extend over constitutional change and political policy? If the Government of Ireland Act claims sovereignty over Northern Ireland, why was it not mentioned in the declaration? What are the subsequent steps which the British government envisages in the peace process? What are the structures and processes which the government expects to be developed from the declaration? Is acceptance of the declaration a precondition for involvement in talks on the development of new political arrangements? What is the process which will lead to 'de-militarisation'?

This follows Monday's announcement by the Ulster Unionists, the province's largest political party, that it would not return to round-table talks with Dublin and other constitutional parties. Mr James Molyneaux, the UUP leader, urged the government to concentrate on setting up an internal Ulster assembly - a proposal likely to be vetoed by Mr John Hume's mainly Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party. London's pessimism over the immediate prospects for further progress emerged at Westminster last night as in the US Mr John Major voiced his determination to press ahead with the search for a comprehensive settlement. The prime minister's reaffirmation of the so-called three-stranded approach came after President Bill Clinton carefully avoided questions on whether the US administration would again allow Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein leader, to visit the US. However, speaking at the White House after talks with Mr Major, Mr Clinton again offered public support for last December's Anglo-Irish declaration as the framework for eventual peace in Northern Ireland. Senior British officials interpreted this as a clear signal that Mr Adams would in future be barred from the US unless and until Sinn Fein renounced IRA violence. Ministers have interpreted the UUP's announcement as in effect the start of a three-month period of political manoeuvring in the run-up to the European elections. The UUP is anxious to protect its flank against Rev Ian Paisley's hardline Democratic Unionist party, which is boycotting bilateral talks with London co-ordinated by Mr Michael Ancram, the Northern Ireland minister. Mr Major refused to accept that the UUP's disavowal of an Anglo-Irish dimension to a settlement meant the process was doomed. The Anglo-Irish liaison committee responsible for exchanging ideas on political progress in Ulster has met once since Mr Major and Mr Albert Reynolds, Irish prime minister, agreed last month to put renewed emphasis on the joint talks. Efforts were under way at Westminster last night to arrange a meeting between Mr Molyneaux and Mr Ancram at which the UUP leader would be asked to clarify his position. Expectations are high at Westminster that further moves to set up a select committee for Northern Ireland will take place before the end of this month. This would be welcomed by unionists.

With insurance companies warning that existing policies covering against terrorism could be withdrawn from next month, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, is discussing possible solutions with the Treasury and the prime minister. No decision has been taken, however, and the government is adamant that insurance companies must bear the brunt of the risks. Ministers are concerned about the propaganda advantage to the IRA if the government gave help and about the cost of its involvement. April's IRA bomb attack in the City caused an estimated Pounds 1bn damage. Mr Heseltine indicated on BBC Radio that he recognised the damage withdrawing cover might have on the property market. 'It is obviously a matter of urgency,' he said. He and Mr Neil Hamilton, the corporate affairs minister, will hold further talks with insurance companies. A Whitehall official said: 'It is quite the most difficult problem that we have had to look at in this parliament.' One scheme being considered is a 5 per cent levy on industrial property insurance that would be pooled to provide cover for terrorist damage with any extra cost underwritten by the government. The scheme has been proposed by the Association of Insurance and Risk Managers in Industry and Commerce, representing more than 300 UK companies. Mr Heseltine is unwilling to disclose his negotiating position, saying he wants to ensure market coverage 'to the greatest extent that is possible'. He appears to have vetoed a version of the Northern Ireland Office's compensation scheme for businesses in the province which pays for all terrorist damage. Last month the Association of British Insurers recommended its members withdraw terrorism cover from commercial insurance policies. The ABI, which has written to the prime minister, wants a similar scheme to that in Northern Ireland Yesterday the ABI said some members were considering cancelling policies that include terrorism cover.

In three decades the two countries have been on the verge of deals a number of times only to see them founder on interpretation. The Anglo-Irish agreement, signed in November 1985, met intense unionist opposition. the then Mrs Margaret Thatcher, UK prime minister, entered into the agreement 'to defeat the men of violence and to bring peace and stability'. Dr Garret FitzGerald, her Irish counterpart, saw it as a way to end problems which the nationalist community felt had not been properly represented in the past. Moderate and hardline unionists believed the agreement betrayed their historic right to veto any deal by giving the Republic of Ireland a say in Northern Ireland affairs. Unionists had shown their muscle before when they rejected the Sunningdale power-sharing agreement in 1973. Hardliners interpreted it as a significant concession to the nationalist community. Renewed Westminster pledges over the next 12 years that Northern Ireland would remain in the UK so long as a majority in the province wished it were wrongly interpreted by unionists as a veto. The constitutional convention set up in 1975 by Mr Merlyn Rees, then secretary for Northern Ireland, was dismantled within months without being able to agree on any alternatives to direct rule. Efforts by Mr James Prior to set up an assembly foundered on the same rock. An attempt at forging a new understanding with the republic fell apart when Mrs Thatcher told parliament in 1982 there was no commitment to consult Dublin on matters relating to Northern Ireland. Yesterday's declaration depends on whether unionists interpret their right to stay in the UK as giving them a veto over the right of the majority in the UK - through the British prime minister - to make whatever agreement the government feels desirable.

Prison Officers' Association officials in the province said yesterday that 80 per cent of those members balloted supported some form of action. The POA committee for Northern Ireland is due to meet today to discuss what form the action should take, but it is not expected to involve a strike. Any action will hit the Maze, Crumlin Road, Magilligan, and Maghaberry prisons as well as a young offenders' centre in Belfast. The Northern Ireland Office said overcrowding claims were exaggerated but POA officials said the situation in the province had become intolerable. Some prisoners were having to share two to a cell, and in some cases there were three to a cell, it said. Speculation that US president Bill Clinton may send a peace envoy to the province was renewed yesterday. The new US ambassador to Ireland, Mrs Jean Kennedy Smith, presented her credentials to Irish President Mary Robinson in Dublin and said she planned to visit Northern Ireland.

0,FT943-4437 ,"FT943-4437 _AN-EIICUAACFT 940909   FT  09 SEP 94 / Loyalist gunmen set out terms for ceasefire: Statement raises hopes of peace      By KEVIN BROWN and JIMMY BURNS      LONDON, BELFAST   Northern Ireland's loyalist paramilitaries yesterday set out their terms for an end to terrorism in response to the IRA's ceasefire declaration, raising the prospect of a permanent end to 25 years of political violence in the province. The Combined Loyalist Military Command, which represents the Ulster Volunteer Force and the Ulster Freedom Fighters, the two main terror groups, stopped short of offering an immediate cessation of violence. But it promised 'a meaningful contribution towards peace' once it is certain that the IRA ceasefire is permanent, that the Irish National Liberation Army has ended violence; that no secret deals have been struck with the republicans; and that Ulster's position within the UK is assured. The statement was dismissed as 'inadequate' by the Northern Ireland Office. Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, said the IRA 'has had the courage to take the initiative. The government and the loyalists have not'. Alderman Hugh Smyth, the Lord Mayor of Belfast, said the statement suggested that a ceasefire was possible if the loyalists received the right answers from the government and republicans. The loyalist command gave no timetable for a ceasefire. It said the decision would depend on the implications of the framework document for Northern Ireland's future being drawn up by the British and Irish governments as part of the peace process, which is unlikely to be published for several weeks. 'Change, if any, can only be honourable after dialogue and agreement. It is important that patience is shown to this body given the gravity of the debate required,' the command said. The announcement followed assurances to unionists from Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, that the number of British troops in Northern Ireland would not be reduced until the government was sure that terrorism had ended. 'The crucial requirement is to ensure the security of the people of Northern Ireland is fully protected, and that is a judgment that has to be looked at very, very carefully,' Mr Rifkind said, during a visit to Berlin. He said a 'gradual reduction' in the military presence would only happen when violence had ended for a 'considerable' time. 'I am not envisaging any immediate changes of that kind'. His comments contrasted sharply with Wednesday's announcement by Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, that security was being scaled down. Troops have discarded steel helmets in favour of berets. Mr Martin McGuinness, a member of Sinn Fein's executive, said Mr Rifkind's comments were 'particularly unimaginative and arrogant'. The presence of British soldiers was 'particularly provocative at this time'. Republican sources said that the combination of the government's cautious approach to security and the loyalist terrorists' delay in declaring a ceasefire would put pressure on the internal discipline of the IRA. However, security sources believe that the ceasefire will hold as long as the peace initiative progresses at government level. They also believe that loyalist violence can be contained. A source close to the loyalist paramilitaries said that the combined command's statement was part of a two-track strategy. The source said that loyalist terrorists wanted to play a part in discussions on Ulster's future, while leaving the option of violence open in case unionists felt threatened by the IRA.

0,FT933-12637 ,"FT933-12637 _AN-DGWCHAB7FT 930723   FT  23 JUL 93 / The Maastricht Vote: Unionist deal turns on 'accountable democracy' for Ulster      By RALPH ATKINS   THE CRUX of the understanding reached last night between the Ulster Unionist party and the government was an apparently vague commitment to restore accountable democracy to Northern Ireland. But the party's MPs made clear that they expected concessions to flow over the next few weeks, after they supported the government in both of last night's votes. The party's nine MPs said they looked to the government 'to fulfil its pledges and restore accountable democracy to the people of Northern Ireland'. There were no specific concessions announced and government ministers said none had been offered. The deal appeared to fall well short of expectations. It was thought that a Northern Ireland select committee was regarded as the absolute minimum that Mr James Molyneaux, the party leader, would demand. But Mr Molyneaux, a canny Westminster operator who has shunned publicity this week, seems to have tried to take a longer-term view and to hammer home to the government how it must now always bear in mind the views of the Ulster Unionist party. The message last night was that Northern Ireland's place in the UK had to be reinforced. With the Irish government anxious that Britain should balance the demands of Unionists and nationalists in the province, Anglo-Irish relations will only be undermined. Steps had also been taken to give locally elected representatives real power  -rather than the present system of direct rule from Westminster, the Ulster Unionist MPs said. A Northern Ireland select committee in the Commons looked set to be the first result of the deal. More broadly, the Ulster Unionists seem to have decided that their interests lay in helping the Conservatives, rather than the Labour party. They have been encouraged by Mr Major's recent attacks on Labour's ideas for joint Anglo-Irish sovereignty for the province - and clashes between London and Dublin on similar proposals. The Ulster Unionists were clear last night that they will support the government in today's confidence motion. The appointment of Mr Kevin McNamara, Labour's nationalist Northern Ireland spokesman, as secretary of state, holds far more horrors for Unionists than Maastricht's eventual ratifi-cation. The Irish government last night reserved comment on the apparent deal, but ministers in Dublin were known to be concerned about the implications of the accord and its consequences for continuing efforts to restore an inter-party, cross-Irish border political dialogue on the future of Northern Ireland. Official sources in the Irish capital said urgent efforts would be made to discover the details of any pact made, or assurances received by the Unionists.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

0,FT943-8467 ,"FT943-8467 _AN-EHQE6ACYFT 940817   FT  17 AUG 94 / Ballot box blarney: An 'either-or' choice will not solve the conflict in N Ireland      By IAN DAVIDSON   If one thing is now clear about the conflict in Northern Ireland, it is that the Irish nationalists are deeply divided over how to respond to last December's peace proposals, put forward by the British and Irish governments in their joint Downing Street declaration. Formally, Sinn Fein, the republican political movement, last month appeared to reject the Anglo-Irish overture, and terrorist attacks have continued. But all recent statements by Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, have suggested that he personally is more in favour of peace than war, and has recommended a ceasefire by the IRA. According to a recent editorial in the Irish Times, 'a great body of informed opinion now agrees that the provisional IRA will shortly call another cease-fire in the North'. But the paper concluded gloomily that any ceasefire would be unlikely to last, since the IRA was still hoping for peace on its terms; in other words it was still hoping for total victory. There was little evidence so far that the IRA would settle for peace on the terms offered, which was a peace of compromise and consent, without winners and without losers. The difficulty for the terrorists - and the problem is the same for the IRA as for its extremist counterparts in the Protestant community - is that the Anglo-Irish declaration is deliberately couched in terms designed to shut out a victory by either side. It speaks sympathetically of the principle of self-determination, but makes clear that this principle will be enacted only through a process of democratic consent. If the nationalists and the Catholics in the province want Northern Ireland to become part of a united Ireland, they must persuade the Protestants and the rest of the population in Northern Ireland of their case, and get it accepted through the ballot box. The problem with the declaration is that the terms as stated are either wholly disingenuous or deliberately deceptive. In it, the British government says that it has 'no selfish strategic or economic interest in Northern Ireland', and will uphold 'the democratic wish of a greater number of people of Northern Ireland on the issue of whether they prefer to support the Union or a sovereign united Ireland'. On the face of it, such a position is democratic, statesmanlike, unexceptionable. In fact, it appears to bear little relation to a province which is the product of an Anglo-Irish conflict at least 400 years old, and which has been racked by terrorism from both sides for a quarter of a century. For the moment, the Protestants are in a clear majority, and it is obvious that, if a plebiscite were held now on the future of the province, it would go in favour of continued membership of the United Kingdom. But the Protestants' share of the population is declining relative to the Catholics', and this causes them profound anxiety; if a similar plebiscite were held in a few decades, it might go in favour of a united Ireland. But these two innocent and contrasting scenarios bear no relationship to the reality that Northern Ireland has lived through for the past 25 years. The idea that there can be a simple 'either-or' choice for the future of the province, which could be settled peacefully and definitively by a majority vote, is a fairy tale. The reason for IRA terrorism is that a tiny minority of the minority community does not accept the will of the majority or the legitimacy of the present constitutional position, and is prepared to kill and maim to overthrow it. But a tiny minority of the majority community is also prepared to kill and maim to uphold the present constitutional arrangement. In other words, the one thing missing from Northern Ireland is the principle of democratic consent, which means acceptance of the will of the majority. And since the province is nearly equally divided between two opposing communities, any question which pits them against each other will have the smallest chance of gaining general democratic consent. So if the question which is supposed to be addressed by the Anglo-Irish declaration is the either-or choice between the United Kingdom and a united Ireland, we can be fairly sure that there is no chance of a peaceful decision through the ballot box. Some people maintain that the British government's apparent indifference to the constitutional destiny of Northern Ireland, provided it is settled democratically, could have the perverse effect of provoking terrorism. For if the UK government really does not care whether Northern Ireland stays or goes, maybe the terrorists have more leverage. I am not sure I go this far. But it is nevertheless rather extraordinary that one of the oldest nation states in Europe should profess disinterest in hanging on to one of its provinces. It is, by contrast, inconceivable that any French government should disclaim any 'selfish strategic or economic interest' in Alsace-Lorraine; and just as inconceivable that any Spanish government should shrug off the destiny of Catalonia or the Basque country. On the contrary, they would rule out, as a matter of principle, any amputation of their territory as an outrage to national sovereignty. Some who think the declaration dangerously provocative would argue that the British government ought to rule out, for ever, any change in the formal constitutional attachment of Northern Ireland. Again, I would not go that far. But since it is almost inconceivable that there could be a peaceful constitutional settlement through a simple majority vote, it seems reckless to indulge in loose talk about 'self-determination' and 'consent', when the first is inapplicable and the second is unavailable.

The timetable from here is hard to predict. Mr Major and his Irish counterpart Mr Albert Reynolds are due to meet at Chequers on Monday to inject new momentum into the peace process. The Irish government in particular is keen to press ahead, and bring Sinn Fein into the democratic fold, concerned that a delay could play into the hands of hardliners in the movement opposed to the ceasefire. Mr Reynolds expects to have his cross party Forum for Peace and Reconciliation under way at the end of the next week. One view in Dublin is that the forum may turn out to be a useful halfway house for Sinn Fein, in its spell of democratic quarantine, while the painstaking verification of the ceasefire and negotiation over surrender of IRA arms continues. The next crucial date will be the publication of the framework document, which will seek to outline what the Northern Ireland Office called the 'shared understanding on the elements of a settlement that is likely to receive widespread acceptance by the people of Northern Ireland'. Officials hope it can be concluded by the year end, although Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, said yesterday there were still differences on difficult constitutional issues. The forum is expected to sit through to the autumn next year. A UK general election is due before summer 1996. If there is a change of Northern Ireland secretary beforehand, that could delay the process for six months. With local elections in Northern Ireland in the meantime, one view is that substantive talks involving the British government and Sinn Fein may not take place before autumn 1997.

He expressed 'disappointment' at the delaying of a meeting expected this week between the two governments. But Sir Patrick told MPs that the time was not yet right for separate negotiations planned between London and Dublin and Northern Ireland's Unionist and nationalist politicians - a series of meetings that Mr David Andrews, the Irish foreign minister, argues should have begun already. The two ministers have not spoken since Monday. The atmosphere of distrust may persuade Sir Patrick that early suspension of the talks process may offer the best way of ensuring it can be resumed later. The end of July has been set as the cut-off point. Unionists are putting an increasing emphasis on the meeting between the two governments - the 'third strand' of the talks process - where they hope Dublin's constitutional claim on Northern Ireland will be discussed. The nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party fears that Sir Patrick is making too many concessions to the Unionists and reneging on his commitment to start talks on relations between north and south Ireland within weeks of the talks process beginning.

The brief, private meeting took place at a college assembly hall in west Belfast, where Mr Adams, among 70 representatives of the area, held out his hand and greeted Mrs Robinson in Irish. Just hours later the Northern Ireland Office said the Irish president was not in the province at the government's invitation. She was there in a private capacity. 'The UK government took steps to make clear that its concern about aspects of the visit - including its planning  - were made known at the highest level in the Irish government,' it said in a statement. Outraged protests by Unionist politicians underlined the added difficulties now facing Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, in seeking to persuade the Unionists to take part in further talks on new democratic structures for the province. Mr Peter Robinson, deputy leader of the Democratic Unionist party, called on Mr John Major, the prime minister, to make an official protest to Dublin about the 'behaviour' of the Irish head of state. He accused her of acting as if she were the head of state of Northern Ireland and giving 'a propaganda boost to the IRA'. While refraining from public comment, Downing Street emphasised that the British government's only role had been to ensure adequate security for Mrs Robinson during the meeting. Another source of irritation was that Mrs Robinson chose to meet Mr Adams within 48 hours of Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, being told at a meeting with Mr Major in London about the efforts being made to persuade the Ulster Unionists to take part in fresh talks. Mr Adams maintained that British politicians had tried to sabotage the Irish president's two-day visit to the province. He claimed that both the British and Irish governments must have seen and approved the guest list. Mrs Robinson said after the meeting that west Belfast had shown her 'the strength, the vitality, the energy and the commitment and the dedication of their community. 'Nobody was hogtying or trying to make a political meeting out of it.' Her action was defended by Mr Kevin McNamara, shadow Northern Ireland secretary.

The blast came hours after an earlier powerful explosion had caused millions of pounds worth of damage. The two attacks represent a partial reversion to the IRA tactics of the mid-1970s, when a high-intensity campaign was undertaken against economic targets. Meanwhile, the government is stepping up its drive against terrorists who try to extort money from businesses in the province in an attempt to stem funding for the IRA. The initiative is spearheaded by C13, a police squad attached to the Royal Ulster Constabulary, and a new government unit composed of civil servants with expert knowledge of the taxation and financial systems. It is estimated that the bill for civilian damage in Northern Ireland during the past year will be some Pounds 60m. The latest explosions follow a stepping up of fire-bomb attacks in the province, which can be carried out by less experienced IRA units. They also come against a background of successful job creation by the government, which has moved some Inland Revenue and social security jobs to the province. After the latest explosion Mr Richard Needham, Northern Ireland economy minister, promised to look carefully at 'every conceivable method we can adopt to ensure we try to keep the bombers out of Belfast city centre'. But Mr Peter Robinson, Democratic Unionist MP for East Belfast, said the government had demonstrated its 'inability to win the war against terrorism'. Meanwhile the army admitted last night that 500 extra troops drafted into Northern Ireland in November to tackle the upsurge in terrorist violence had been withdrawn. In Lancashire, police appealed to the public for help to catch an IRA unit operating in north-west England after the discovery of a 6lb bomb near Weeton Barracks, Blackpool.

In an article published in yesterday's Irish Times, Sir Patrick used new and more straightforward language to address some of the concerns and uncertainties arising from the Downing Street declaration and to offer a more detailed vision of what could lie beyond a permanent end to violence. His message came as it emerged at Westminster that Sir Patrick has given the hardline Democratic Unionist party a virtual assurance that the Anglo-Irish conference will not meet while political talks are taking place. Mr Peter Robinson, the DUP deputy leader, said a letter recently received from the Northern Ireland secretary indicated 'a willingness to suspend' the conference. The DUP - which is boycotting the talks process - last week wrote to Mr John Major requesting a meeting before the prime minister's next encounter with Mr Albert Reynolds, his Irish counterpart, on Saturday. According to Mr Robinson, Sir Patrick also stressed that there was no requirement for the DUP to accept the joint declaration as the basis for political talks. In yesterday's article, Sir Patrick forcefully reiterated the government's insistence that the IRA must end hostilities and that Sinn Fein must renounce the justification of violence and commit itself exclusively to the democratic process. But he also attempted to edge forward on some areas cited by republicans as being in need of clarification. His remarks were welcomed by Mr Reynolds. Sir Patrick repeated his view that, in the event of an end to IRA violence, Sinn Fein could be admitted to exploratory talks 'within three months' rather than at the end of a three-month quarantine period. He said that once it was clear that all terrorist violence had ceased for good, the benefits to the community would include 'our ability to manage without troops being deployed in support of the police and without emergency legislation'. Sir Patrick said Britain 'cannot and will not adopt the role of persuader for any particular outcome' and that 'with or without' Sinn Fein, the process would go ahead. He added: 'We are, however, persuaders who urge the really committed to search for widely-based agreement.' In a passage intended to assure nationalists, Sir Patrick said he wanted to see 'substantial devolved powers' in Northern Ireland but he emphasised that this would not be done on a unilateral basis but through agreement within the so-called 'three- stranded' talks process which includes the Irish government. 'We cannot revert to a system of government in Northern Ireland with which only one part of the community can readily identify.' In Ulster, local politicians yesterday voiced alarm over the rise in attacks by loyalist paramilitaries. Mr Seamus Mallon, deputy leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party, said members of his party were increasingly being singled out as terrorist targets.

Here is the 'Gold Coast' commuter belt of Northern Ireland, where a dozen golf courses and the ubiquitous two-car garages, horse-boxes and boat-trailers define the lifestyle of the business executives and senior civil servants who run the province. The buzz of lawnmowers and chatter of birdsong are all that are likely to intrude upon the silence, not the blast of Semtex or bursts of gunfire - even though the Falls and Shankill roads of Belfast are just 15 minutes' drive away. But North Down is about to become the most hotly contested seat in the Northern Ireland general election campaign. Mr Jim Kilfedder, an independent Unionist and MP for 22 years, is defending a 3,900 majority against a three-pronged assault - from another Unionist, the Conservative party and the non-sectarian Alliance Party. The nationalist SDLP does not normally stand in North Down, as it has little local support. This is one of only four Ulster seats it is not fighting. The outcome will have little influence on the overall election result, but could have a crucial bearing on the future of Northern Ireland politics. The campaign is not being fought on tax cuts or government spending. All the candidates agree it is being fought over the future form of government for Northern Ireland. The Conservative party is for the first time mounting a concerted challenge to the Unionists, fielding candidates in 11 of the province's 17 constituencies. North Down, which would be a 'natural' Tory seat anywhere in England, is where they stand the most chance of success. Mr Laurence Kennedy, the Conservative candidate and the party's leader in the province, says: 'Unionism and nationalism is responsible for so much that has gone wrong in Northern Ireland.' But all is not well in the Tory camp - the Conservative government, through the Anglo-Irish agreement, is committed to an eventual devolved government in Ulster; the Northern Ireland Conservatives are not. 'Conservative policy on Northern Ireland is very non-specific,' says Mr Kennedy. 'We want the province governed in a similar way to the rest of the UK, with stronger local authorities and more attention paid to Northern Ireland at Westminster.' Local authorities in Ulster 'currently only have powers to supervise rubbish collection, playgrounds and to bury the dead'. Greater powers, he says, will create the opportunity for the minority nationalists to exercise greater influence. Mr Kennedy is disappointed that Mr Peter Brooke, the Northern Ireland secretary, 'has not come out and said that people here should join and support the Conservatives'. It is doubtful that any senior ministers will be showing the flag in North Down during the campaign. This weakness in Mr Kennedy's campaign is being exploited by his opponents. Mr Kilfedder claims that more than 80 prominent Tory figures have written to him declaring their support. In the event of a hung parliament, there is no doubt where his allegiance will lie: 'I will be voting with John Major.' Mr Kilfedder's crypto-conservatism is exploited by traditional Unionists. For the first time since he won his seat in 1970, he is being challenged by a Unionist - Mr Denny Vitty of the Rev Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionist Party. Mr Vitty describes both Mr Kennedy and Mr Kilfedder as 'wolves in sheep's clothing'. He says: 'They cannot stand on both sides of the fence. They cannot be true Unionists as well as Conservatives.' His campaign will focus on the Unionist goal of ending the Anglo-Irish agreement. 'We will use the opportunity of a hung parliament to negotiate from a position of strength,' he says.' He believes that the maverick Mr Kilfedder, who split from the Ulster Unionist Party in the mid 1970s over his refusal to take the whip on a range of policy issues, will not win hard-core Unionist support. He is confident that the 5,000 new voters in the Protestant middle-class and working-class housing estates that have sprung up in North Down in the past five years will vote for back him. Mr Addie Morrow, the Alliance candidate, hopes the divisions in the Conservative and Unionist ranks and the failure of either tradition to resolve Ulster's problems will create space for his party with its liberal, non-sectarian profile, to win its first Westminster seat. 'If we can achieve a breakthrough it will change the whole face of Northern Ireland,' he says. His party stands for a devolved administration in Ulster and power-sharing between the two communities. Whether an independent such as Mr Kilfedder can rely on his personal popularity to survive remains to be seen. At his seaside home in Bangor a portrait of Queen Victoria hangs on one wall. Framed pictures of the British and Irish parliaments hang on opposing walls in another room.

The two leaders were meeting in  Indianapolis, where Mr Clinton was unveiling a monument to  assassination victims John Kennedy and Martin Luther King.    Mr Reynolds was expected to discuss with the President a  list  of questions drawn up by Sinn Fein, the political arm of the  IRA, about the Downing Street peace declaration. Sinn Fein  submitted the list to Mr Reynolds earlier this week and it was  then in turn relayed to London.    Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew has said he  will publish the list soon -- together with Britain's response.  However, Ulster Unionists are suspicious of the Sinn Fein move,  fearing it is another attempt at persuading Britain to clarify  the declaration -- something John Major and Sir Patrick have  consistently refused to do.    A Northern Ireland Office spokesman said Sir Patrick had not  ruled out answering specific questions about the declaration,  but still insisted it was not up for negotiation.    Peter Robinson, deputy leader of the hardline Democratic  Unionist Party, today warned that any answering of the questions  by Britain would amount to clarification. He added: ""Here once  again we have a Government that lies and deceives, a Government  that tells us one thing and does another. It is a Government  that cannot be trusted.    ""Rewarding gunmen and bombers is not a proper way for a  Government, especially Her Majesty's Government, to be behaving.""    Mr Robinson, MP for Belfast East, also criticised the Irish  Government for acting as ""postmen by appointment to the  Provisional IRA"".    Sinn Fein's questions are believed to centre on the precise  way forward proposed by the Britain and Ireland if the IRA ends  its campaign of violence. Mr Reynolds has made it clear he sees  the Sinn Fein approach as offering new hope of success for the  declaration he and Mr Major signed in Downing Street last  December.    For his part, Mr Clinton, who requested today's talks, is  anxious to be fully briefed on the latest Northern Ireland  position ahead of an imminent visit to Britain. Mr Reynolds,  who is due back in Dublin on Monday, is planning to deal with  the Ulster issue in a speech in Indiana tomorrow when he is due  to receive an an honourary degree from Notre Dame university.  He said on his arrival in the US that Sinn Fein's questions  should be dealt with ""as soon as possible"" to permit the peace  process to move ahead.     "

In a letter to Mr Kevin McNamara, the shadow Northern Ireland secretary, Sir Patrick said he 'much regretted' any distress caused by his remark about a grenade explosion in Belfast on Saturday that injured nearly 30 people. This had been made as 'an expression of relief' that no one had been killed in the incident, the Northern Ireland secretary said, adding: 'I saw at once that it could have caused offence.' Sir Patrick had angered Mr McNamara and Ulster Unionist MPs after joking that 'nobody was dead' after the explosion during a loyalist parade in the Shankill area of Belfast. Mr McNamara later condemned Sir Patrick for making 'flippant and unfeeling' remarks and wrote demanding an apology. The row followed the decision by the BBC in Ulster to broadcast a recording of remarks by Sir Patrick made when visiting the opera in Castleward, county Down, with the prime minister on Saturday night. The scene had been planned as a delicate public relations exercise, designed to demonstrate that there was more to Belfast than bombs or dole queues. Mr John Major's party had swooped in army helicopters into the elegant grounds of Castleward to see Donizetti's Lucia Di Lammermoor. Faced with a barrage of press questions on recent explosions, Mr Major insisted as he strode across the grass: 'We have only come for the opera. I have no comment to make.' Sir Patrick, however, after saying he would not comment until briefed, said: 'Well, nobody is dead yet. At the end of this opera, everybody is dead.' As the faces of his hovering press officers froze, Sir Patrick quickly added that it was no joking matter. He went on to express his outrage to the waiting cameras. Sir Patrick's aside was seen as insensitive by local politicians - and highlighted the precarious task faced by Northern Ireland secretaries, who rarely win a loyal following among the province's politicians. Mr Peter Robinson, deputy leader of the Democratic Unionist party, said Sir Patrick's remarks had been 'absolutely disgraceful.' Mr McNamara last night accepted Sir Patrick's expressions of regret, saying: 'He dropped a clanger. He has apologised which is more than most members of this government do when clangers are dropped. There the matter rests.'   Countries:-  GBZ   United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P9721 International Affairs.     P9229 Public Order and Safety, NEC.   Types:-  NEWS  General News.

0,FT943-5955 ,"FT943-5955 _AN-EIAD1ADIFT 940901   FT  01 SEP 94 / Leading Article: The prize in Ulster   It is still not clear that the ceasefire announced yesterday by the Irish Republican Army is permanent, a necessary condition for political talks involving Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing. But the substance of the announcement seems unambiguous. There is a widely-held feeling on all sides in Northern Ireland that a new phase has begun, a turning away from the violence that has brought misery to nationalists and unionists alike. That alone is cause for rejoicing. There are few parallels that can be drawn between Ulster and long-running conflicts in South Africa and the Middle East. But events in these other places show that, when all sides are committed to finding a solution, there is a momentum in the peace process that sweeps away many of the real or imagined obstacles. That this point appears to have been reached in Northern Ireland is a tribute to effective co-operation between the UK and Irish governments. Mr John Major deserves credit for placing a solution in Ulster on his list of priorities. He has made clear that Britain has no strategic interest in Northern Ireland apart from protecting the right of its people to determine their future. He has also taken risks, most notably in conducting secret exchanges with Sinn Fein leaders. Those risks appear to have paid off, thanks to his cool determination under fire. Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish Taoiseach, has also been prepared to take risks. In last December's Downing Street Declaration, he acknowledged the right of the people of Northern Ireland to remain in the UK unless they decided otherwise. He also undertook to amend the claims in the Irish constitution to the north - essential in reassuring unionists. The peace process will not be smooth. There will be those among both the republican and the 'loyalist' communities who will try to disrupt it. There may be a breakaway from the IRA, with diehards seeking to continue the violence. The process will have to survive whatever 'spectaculars' are thrown up at a time when trust may still be in short supply. There is also the fear of betrayal among the unionist majority that must be constantly and convincingly assuaged. It was their opposition that derailed two previous attempts at constitutional settlements involving the Irish Republic. The main Unionist party, led by Mr James Molyneaux, has sensibly accepted the assurances of the Downing Street Declaration on Northern Ireland's right to self-determination. But the Reverend Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionists seem to be flirting with the idea that any peace must involve unacceptable concessions to Dublin. Now, therefore, is not a time for complacency but for renewed efforts to maintain the momentum. Mr John Hume, leader of the moderate nationalists, advises throwing away the formal timetable for bringing Sinn Fein to the conference table. This advice should be politely turned down. The quarantine period of three months after a permanent ceasefire is the least that will be acceptable to the unionists. But there is scope to provide immediate benefits to all the people of Northern Ireland that will carry forward the peace process. One priority must be to scale down the military presence to the minimum level compatible with protecting all sections from maverick terrorists. Another is to lift the absurd ban on broadcasting the voices of Sinn Fein members which has done so much harm to the UK's reputation abroad. A peace process involves a dialogue, and a dialogue is impossible if one side cannot be heard. Finally, amendments to articles 2 and 3 of the Irish constitution to remove the unqualified claims to the north are promised as part of a final settlement. Bringing forward the changes would bolster unionist confidence. The ceasefire demands further risks on all sides to win the bigger prize of lasting peace in Ireland.

Mr Dick Spring, foreign affairs minister, urged Unionist parties to return to the negotiating table. 'I want to see an accommodation on the constitutional issue which is reasonable and fair to all,' he said. The reaction in Whitehall was cautiously upbeat. Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, hopes the new Irish government will help end the political deadlock in the province. But Mr Spring's overtures were given a chilly response by Unionist leaders, suggesting any breakthrough remains elusive. Nonetheless, it is the most affirmative statement yet by the Irish government that it is willing to embark on some sort of compromise with Northern Ireland's Unionist majority. It was the first keynote speech by Mr Spring, the Labour party leader, on the Northern Ireland issue since he took office in January as part of the new coalition. Mr Spring would appear to be asserting the stamp of his party, which has one third of the seats in the cabinet, on the country's foreign policy. All-party talks on Northern Ireland, embracing the UK and Irish governments and the four main constitutional parties in Northern Ireland, broke down last November. The Unionists insist the republic must drop its territorial claim to the north if progress is to be made. Mr Spring said yesterday that his government was committed to the principle, laid out in the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement, that there would be no change in the status of Northern Ireland without the consent of the majority there. 'We will be quite ready to confirm and elaborate that principle in various ways as Unionists might wish, in any new agreement that transcends the Anglo-Irish Agreement,' he said, adding that the constitution was never intended to be an obstacle to mutual understanding. Mr Spring said: 'We clearly see the need to get around the table to work out how a generally acceptable package might fairly accommodate the deep divisions, including the divisions on constitutional issues, which are the source of the conflict.' He also proposed a new agreement or covenant. Mr Spring hinted that he might be prepared to travel to Belfast to restart bilateral negotiations with the Unionists, and added: 'We must at some time reach the point where all of us around a table can say to each other: this is a very difficult for us, but it is a just and fair compromise.' Mr Peter Robinson, deputy leader of the Democratic Unionist Party in Northern Ireland, responded negatively, to the offer, saying: 'Between my door and his door there is a road which has a very large obstacle placed on it, which he alone and his country can remove - that must be the priority. 'He has to face up to the reality that you cannot have a new relationship until the Irish Republic removes its claim to our territory.'   Countries:-  IEZ  Ireland, EC.     GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

0,FT921-13475 ,"FT921-13475 _AN-CAUBNAE7FT 920121   FT  21 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Traditional Tory lives to fight another day - Searching for the true character of Northern Ireland secretary Peter Brooke      By RALPH ATKINS   MR PETER Brooke, who offered to resign yesterday as Northern Ireland secretary, is not a politician at ease with the late 20th century. He is a traditional Tory, fascinated with history, who bumbles poetry and witticisms to journalists and politicians. He is polite, honest - and sometimes recklessly honourable. For a time last year, as he announced the first 'round-table' talks in the province for 15 years, he won praise from all sides - including those Unionist MPs who this week triggered his offer. It was a rare high point in 13 years of drift in Northern Ireland under Tory rule. His patience and courtesy have earned him the respect necessary to bring Northern Ireland's recalcitrant political leaders back into the democratic fold. Such integrity lay behind yesterday's announcement. Mr Brooke felt the remaining allegiances he could command among the province's politicians had been undermined. But his offer also suggests a pent-up frustration - over his failure in the six months to restart his talks and, possibly, over his relationship with Mr Major. Officials and colleagues on all sides of the Chamber were taken aback by his announcement. Those Unionists who were there, and not at the funerals of construction workers killed by the IRA on Friday, appeared taken aback by the effect of their jibes. 'We could paper the offices with Unionist demands for the secretary of state to resign,' one official said at the weekend. The Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionist party, is not backward in calling for ministerial scalps. Frustration among Northern Ireland secretaries is hardly surprising. The least-envied of all Cabinet posts brings oppressive round-the-clock security, universal cynicism, and the prospect only of being immersed in the province's agonisingly languid politics and endless security crises. In spite of his achievements, Mr Brooke has never been immune to the pressures. He finds it difficult to knock heads together. During last summer's 'round-table' talks he was unable to force the pace when deliberations were bogged down for seven weeks of procedural arrangements. Participants complained of waiting for long periods as Mr Brooke pondered where to go next. He is not, colleagues say, a great thinker. He can be moody. There is no 'Brooke vision' on Northern Ireland. He does not appear to get on automatically with Mr Major. Aristocratic mannerisms - his ancestral home was in County Cavan, now in the Irish Republic - jar with the prime minister's classless politics. Mr Brooke, who supported Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, during the 1990 Conservative party leadership election, might well have been happier as a Tory politician of the Victorian era. He enjoys the cultural distractions of his job - taking an academic interest in the events leading up the 1920s partition of Ireland - but not the unrelenting pressure. So far, Mr Major has had little input into Conservative policy on Northern Ireland, perhaps adding to Mr Brooke's sense of discontent. Mr Brooke has made serious mistakes before. Shortly after becoming secretary of state, he gave an interview in which he appeared to envisage eventual talks with Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA. Beforehand he had an unhappy period as Tory party chairman when he oversaw the Conservative party's defeat in the 1989 European elections. His posting to the Northern Ireland office by Mrs Margaret Thatcher, the former prime minister, was seen as a sideways step. Mr Brooke has weathered past storms but last night his position appeared to have been weakened considerably. It is difficult to see how he can last much beyond the general election. But a ministerial resignation so close to a general election would have been highly damaging. It appears evident that Mr Major decided that, for now at least, he could not manage without him.

In an article published in yesterday's IRISH TIMES, Sir  Patrick used new and more straightforward language to address  some of the concerns and uncertainties arising from the Downing  Street declaration and to offer a more detailed vision of what  could lie beyond a permanent end to violence.    His message came as it emerged at Westminster that Sir  Patrick has given the hardline Democratic Unionist party [DUP] a  virtual assurance that the Anglo-lrish conference will not meet  while political talks are taking place. Mr Peter Robinson, the  DUP deputy leader, said a letter recently received from the  Northern Ireland secretary indicated ""a willingness to suspend""  the conference.    The DUP -- which is boycotting the talks process -- last  week  wrote to Mr John Major requesting a meeting before the prime  minister's next encounter with Mr Albert Reynolds, his Irish  counterpart, on Saturday.    According to Mr Robinson, Sir Patrick also stressed that  there was no requirement for the DUP to accept the joint  declaration as the basis for political talks.    In yesterday's article, Sir Patrick forcefully reiterated  the  government's insistence that the IRA must end hostilities and  that Sinn Fein must renounce the justification of violence and  commit itself exclusively to the democratic process. But he  also attempted to edge forward on some areas cited by  republicans as being in need of clarification.    His remarks were welcomed by Mr Reynolds.    Sir Patrick repeated his view that, in the event of an end  to  IRA violence, Sinn Fein could be admitted to exploratory talks  ""within three months"" rather than at the end of a three-month  quarantine period. He said that once it was clear that all  terrorist violence had ceased for good, the benefits to the  community would include ""our ability to manage without troops  being deployed in support of the police and without emergency  legislation.""    Sir Patrick said Britain ""cannot and will not adopt the role  of persuader for any particular outcome"" and that ""with or  without"" Sinn Fein, the process would go ahead. He added: ""We  are, however, persuaders who urge the really committed to search  for widely-based agreement.""    In a passage intended to assure nationalists, Sir Patrick  said he wanted to see ""substantial devolved powers"" in Northern  Ireland but he emphasised that this would not be done on a  unilateral basis but through agreement within the so-called  three-stranded talks process which includes the Irish  government. ""We cannot revert to a system of government in  Northern Ireland with which only one part of the community can  readily identify.""    In Ulster, local politicians yesterday voiced alarm over the  rise in attacks by loyalist paramilitaries. Mr Seamus Mallon,  deputy leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party, said  members of his party were increasingly being singled out as  terrorist targets.     "

As Ulster Unionist MPs said privately that they were looking for an 'enduring' agreement that would result in Northern Ireland being governed more like other parts of the UK, the prime minister held out the prospect of the province's constitutional status being written into a new Anglo-Irish agreement. No deal is expected to be struck until hours before tonight's vote.

Mr John Hume delivered the warning in a letter to Sir Peter Emery, Tory chairman of the Commons procedure committee. A decision by ministers to press ahead with a select committee for the province would be seen as reinforcing the government's commitment to its unionist majority. Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, offered encouragement to select committee supporters in the Commons just six days ago by acknowledging - in response to a question from Mr Hume - that the idea could have 'some value'. Confirmation of Mr Hume's letter emerged as British and Irish officials continued concerted efforts to bridge differences between London and Dublin over their planned joint declaration aimed at securing peace in Northern Ireland. Officials are striving to narrow the gap between the two sides ahead of the next scheduled meeting between Mr John Major, the prime minister, and Mr Albert Reynolds, his Irish counterpart, in Brussels on Friday or Saturday. Questioned in the Dublin parliament yesterday, Mr Reynolds was upbeat about the pace of progress while admitting that 'a number of important outstanding issues' had still to be resolved. In a fresh attempt to reassure unionists, the Irish premier declared for the first time in the Dail that Dublin was prepared to make a written pledge to hold a referendum on its territorial claim over Northern Ireland. Speaking as Mr Peter Robinson, deputy leader of the hardline Democratic Unionist party, warned he would 'never accept' any further dilution of the unionist position, Mr Reynolds said Dublin was relying on Mr Major to keep unionists informed about the peace process. Mr Hume is understood to believe any discussions about a select committee should involve the province's non-violent political parties. An agreement reached elsewhere would amount to a private deal. Adria, the Ulster textile company, is creating 400 jobs in two projects in the north-west of the province. Some 250 jobs will arise from the expansion of Adria's Campsie factory, near Londonderry.

But at the end of last night's unprecedented public confrontation between a Sinn Fein leader and a government emissary there appeared to have been no progress along the road to a durable political settlement in Northern Ireland. The 15-minute televised debate between Mr Gerry Adams and Mr Michael Mates, the former Northern Ireland minister, sent to the US to counter the Sinn Fein president's two-week propaganda offensive, quickly degenerated into point-scoring and insults. For anyone viewing the encounter as a dry run for the talks that could take place between the government and the IRA's political wing as soon as December, the portents were not encouraging. When it was all over, the clearest impression was that Mr Adams, whose voice was until recently prevented from being heard on the British media by the government's broadcasting ban, still had much to learn in terms of communicating his message effectively on television. To that extent, last night's event was a success for the more restrained Mr Mates and went some way to vindicating the government's decision to dispatch him to the US. In the course of the bad-tempered exchanges, broadcast on BBC's Newsnight, Mr Adams again refused to be drawn on whether the IRA's four-week-old ceasefire was permanent, saying only that as far as he was concerned 'we are in the final phase of this struggle'. He tried to put pressure on the government to lift its exclusion order preventing him from visiting the British mainland, saying it was 'silly and bizarre' that the debate had to take place in New York. 'Why can't I come to London to discuss this?' he asked. 'The banning order should be stopped immediately.' Mr Mates suggested that the ban could in time be lifted. On the question of consent to an eventual settlement, there was no hint of a narrowing of the gap between the two sides. Mr Mates said Northern Ireland's future had to be settled with the consent of the people of Northern Ireland. Mr Adams retorted that Britain should leave it to parties in Ireland and Northern Ireland to decide how their right to self-determination was exercised.

It emerged yesterday that Mr William Flyn, president of Mutual America, one of the biggest US insurance companies, has renewed contact with Sinn Fein while on a visit this week to Dublin and Belfast. Mr Flyn is part of a delegation of Irish-American businessmen who have been discussing investment oppor-tunities on both sides of the Irish border with government officials and local enterprises. He is understood to have used the opportunity of the visit to try to persuade Sinn Fein of the growing support within the Irish-American community for the UK-Irish peace initiative. Mr Flyn was one of the central figures behind the controversial visit of Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, to New York in February. His invitation to Mr Adams to speak at a conference on Northern Ireland led to President Bill Clinton granting the Sinn Fein leader a visa against the advice of British and US state department officials. Mr Flyn believes the visit helped strengthen Mr Adams's influence within the IRA in support of the peace initiative and exposed republican militants to the moderation of most Irish Americans. He said yesterday that continuing paramilitary violence in Northern Ireland remained the 'biggest obstacle' to increased US investment in the province, but he felt 'encouraged' about the prospects for peace. Northern Ireland officials regard the US as important to the local economy - 38 US companies operate in the province employing about 9 per cent of the manufacturing workforce, much of it in Roman Catholic areas. The visit by US company executives follows a plea by Mr John Major, the prime minister, during his visit to the US in March that the influence of corporate Irish-America be brought to bear on producing peace in Northern Ireland.

0,FT934-4756 ,"FT934-4756 _AN-DLBCKAEEFT 931202   FT  02 DEC 93 / London admits errors in secret documents on IRA contacts      By DAVID OWEN and TIM COONE   The British government's credibility on Northern Ireland was severely tarnished last night when it admitted that mistakes were contained in secret documents released on Monday detailing exchanges with Provisional leaders. The admission followed confirmation that Mr John Major and Mr Albert Reynolds will tomorrow make a concerted attempt to bridge differences between London and Dublin over a constitutional settlement for the province. The meeting will come amid signs of mounting strain in their relations. The Northern Ireland Office was last night at pains to emphasise that mistakes in the documents were accidental and the result of transcriptional typing. The admission, which is expected to be pounced on by Unionist MPs in the Commons today, followed threats by Sinn Fein to 'set the record straight' amid claims that some of the British documents were bogus. Separately, the IRA last night made the sensational claim, strongly denied by Downing Street, that the government had proposed holding secret talks with it in March in Scotland or Scandinavia. It said: 'We wish to confirm that . . . the British Government made a definitive proposal for full-blown delegate meetings between their representatives and Sinn Fein.' It claimed the government asked for an unannounced suspension of activity to help accommodate the meetings. Both London and Dublin were last night playing down expectations of what the 'working' summit between the two prime ministers was likely to achieve, billing it as the first of two or three important sessions that could take place before Christmas. At least one additional meeting between the two leaders - at next week's European Council in Brussels - might well be needed before a joint communique could be agreed. The two prime ministers would be accompanied tomorrow by other senior ministers. The main sticking point is understood to concern Dublin's insistence on including acceptance of the principle of self-determination for the people of all of Ireland in any joint communique.

In a carefully worded message on the eve of Sinn Fein's  annual conference in Dublin, the prime minister will attempt to  tip the debate within the republican movement in favour of  accepting the Downing Street declaration.    In today's IRISH NEWS, the Belfast-based nationalist  newspaper, Mr Major is expected to offer the most detailed  exposition to date of the way ahead for republicans once the  joint declaration has been accepted.    He was backed yesterday by a call from Mr Albert Reynolds,  his Irish counterpart, for republican acceptance of the  declaration. Mr Reynolds urged Sinn Fein to adopt a policy of  non-coercion of Ulster's Protestants.    He said: ""What the peace declaration offers is a future free  of coercion, British or Irish, loyalist or republican. That is  the huge psychological step that we are asking not just  republicans, but everyone, to take.""    It also emerged yesterday that Mr Michael Ancram, the  Northern Ireland minister, is ready to begin more detailed  discussions with the province's constitutional parties.    Mr Ancram expects within days to start exploring the  parties'  reaction to the checklist of ideas drawn up earlier this month  by Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary.    The talks are to run alongside discussions between officials  in London and Dublin on proposals for a new political  settlement. Ministers hope for progress on both elements of the  talks process by the next Anglo-Irish intergovernmental  conference on March 10.    Against a background of mounting unionist hostility towards  the direction of the UK-Irish political initiative, the Ulster  Unionists -- the province's largest party -- will on Monday  publish its proposals for a settlement. These will focus mainly  on a devolved government for Ulster.    Although a definitive Sinn Fein response to the Downing  Street declaration is not expected to emerge from the  conference, due to a stand-off between Sinn Fein and the UK over  the issue of ""clarification,"" Dublin has in effect pointed to a  way in which the deadlock might be broken.    Mr Reynolds referred positively to a recent article by Mr  Mitchel McLoughlin, Sinn Fein's Northern Ireland chairman,  stating that Protestants in the province should not be coerced  into a united Ireland. If the Sinn Fein conference were to make  ""a clear endorsement of a policy of non-coercion"" of the  unionists, this would represent ""an immense step forward,"" Mr  Reynolds said.     "

As unionist MPs demanded his resignation, Sir Patrick hastily convened a press conference at Stormont Castle in Belfast for what most political observers saw as a damage-limitation exercise. Yes, a message had been sent to the IRA but no, there had not been talks or negotiations with terrorist leaders and no one from the British government or civil service was authorised to conduct such talks. Sir Patrick said a message was received from the IRA at the end of February to the effect that 'the conflict was over' and asked for advice on how to bring it to a close. The government responded by demanding a 'genuine ending of violence' before there was any question of talks. Sir Patrick said: 'Nobody has been authorised to enter into discussions with the IRA. The people of Northern Ireland do not want peace at any price and in my judgment the IRA should not be offered a price.' He firmly rejected questions about the nature of the 'communication channel' as it could 'endanger lives'. 'There is a chain of communication. I am not prepared to enter into discussion or description of that chain. To do that could endanger lives,' Sir Patrick said. He disclosed that the chain had been in place for a number of years and remained confidential. But it was on the question of the government's reluctance to acknowledge the existence of the contact with the IRA that Sir Patrick found himself under most pressure. At one point he was asked: 'Do you accept that you deceived people in Northern Ireland?' He rejected the suggestion. Another questioner asked him to elaborate on the difference between talking to and writing to the IRA. He replied: 'Well, you use your mouth when talking.' The Northern Ireland secretary revealed that contacts had taken place recently. He disclosed that another message from the IRA was received on November 2, two days after the Greysteel massacre and after one of the worst months of violence in the Northern Ireland troubles. Another reply was sent on November 5. The Democratic Unionist deputy leader, Mr Peter Robinson, reacted angrily to the disclosures and said unionists no longer trusted the government. Mr Robinson claimed it was inconceivable that one of the most sophisticated terrorist organisations in the world would ask the government for advice on ending violence. In an effort to reassure MPs, Sir Patrick said the correspondence to date would be placed in the Commons library as soon as possible. Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, said the contacts had been authorised by the prime minister as well as Sir Patrick. But Mr Adams disputed the government's version of events and said that at no point was there any communication from the IRA stating that the conflict was over.

Mr John Bruton, the Fine Gael leader, supported by 85 votes to 74, becomes Ireland's 10th prime minister, leading a coalition with Mr Dick Spring's Labour party and the Democratic Left of Mr Proinsias De Rossa. Mr Bruton, who succeeds Fianna Fail's Mr Albert Reynolds, said the government's first national aim would be to sustain the Northern Ireland peace process. In London, Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, said he had sought an early meeting with the new Irish premier. Mr Bruton is expected to have his first meeting with Mr Gerry Adams, the leader of Sinn Fein, at today's session of the Dublin government's National Forum for Peace and Reconciliation. Mr Bruton told the Dail (parliament), his government would 'work ceaselessly and sensitively to make peace a permanent part of our future'. His election was welcomed by unionists in Northern Ireland. Mr Peter Robinson, Democratic Unionist MP for East Belfast, said Mr Bruton had a greater understanding of the Ulster Unionist position than most members of the Irish parliament. His desire to change articles two and three of the republic's constitution - claiming territorial jurisdiction over Northern Ireland  - was a 'promising backcloth' to his term in office, Mr Robinson said. Mr Bruton conceded that the government was made up of parties whose 'origins and policies' were very different. But he insisted that 'differences don't have to pose a threat'. Fine Gael, a rurally based party with largely middle-class support, will have eight ministers. Labour, which has projected itself as a European-style secular party, will have six ministers - the same number it had in the outgoing administration. However, Labour's Mr Ruairi Quinn will take over the finance portfolio, the first time it has not been held by the largest party. Democratic Left, the successor of the Official IRA when the Provisional IRA split to pursue the armed struggle in 1970, dropped its earlier insistence on two cabinet positions. The main points of the new government's agreed programme include moves to keep public borrowing below 3 per cent of gross national product; tax cuts for the low paid; a freeze on privatisation; a referendum on divorce; and a commitment to the Northern Ireland peace process. The breakthrough coincides with talks yesterday in Belfast between the British officials and loyalist paramilitaries. David Owen adds: In London, Mr Major said he was confident the new Dublin government would wish to 'sustain together the work we have done over Northern Ireland'.

An agreement paving the way for the start of construction in the next three months was signed in Belfast yesterday between Hualon and the province's Industrial Development Board. A parallel ceremony was held in Taiwan. Hualon executives took the opportunity to defend both the company's reputation and its ambitious plan to build its first manufacturing unit outside Asia. The plant, which will supply synthetic fibre to low-cost clothing manufacturers in Europe, is intended to provide products to compete against imports from the Far East. Doubts about the 1.5m sq ft plant arose after disclosures of court proceedings against two Hualon executives over alleged share fraud. Other textile makers have also queried the company's ability to succeed in a European market suffering from overcapacity, and challenged Hualon's forecast of 1,800 new jobs. In Taiwan, Mr Oung Ta-Ming - the multi-millionaire who controls the Hualon family empire from behind the scenes - made an unscheduled appearance half-way through the ceremonies. He referred all business-related inquiries to company executives, saying: 'I don't know  - you have to ask them. They tell me what they are doing and I say okay.' Hualon's president, Mr Liang Ching-hsiung, said the Northern Ireland project was intended to upgrade product standards and to gain a foothold in Europe. The investment would be made directly from the parent company in Taiwan, but the group's unlisted Malaysian arm would play an important role in the project, as its operations were similar to those planned for Belfast, Mr Liang said. In Belfast, Mr Andrew Oung, vice-chairman of Hualon, rejected suggestions that the company's production and job forecasts were over-ambitious and insisted that the recent court cases had no bearing on the company's standing. He said Hualon was 'a decent company' and the allegations against two of its executives had failed to harm its stock market standing in Asia. Mr Tim Smith, Northern Ireland industry minister, said he had 'every confidence' in the project. He emphasised the phased nature of the nine-year project and said the Pounds 61m grant aid would depend on Hualon's objectives being met at each stage. About 10 per cent of the total grant aid is related to job creation. Hualon breaks ground for project, Page 7   Companies:-  Hualon Corp.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

0,FT932-8620 ,"FT932-8620 _AN-DERDAAESFT 930518   FT  18 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Temptation of a safe, but undynamic investment / A look at Northern Ireland Electricity, whose pathfinder prospectus is published today      By MICHAEL SMITH   IMAGINE a company which was guaranteed fixed revenues on the bulk of its most profitable business, regardless of whether sales volumes went up or down. Investors looking for a safe, if undynamic, home for their funds would be sorely tempted to buy into it. Next month they will be given the opportunity when the government sells off Northern Ireland Electricity, the last non-nuclear power company to remain in the UK public sector, for between Pounds 300m and Pounds 400m. The guarantee of income stems from a regulatory regime which is among several factors setting NIE apart from the other electricity companies in the United Kingdom. The differences - good and bad - will come under close examination in the next week or so as the more than 400,000 people and institutions who have registered an interest in the flotation decide whether to buy shares. A pathfinder prospectus on the sale will be published today. Northern Ireland Electricity is what remains of the province's state electricity company following the disposal last year of four power stations to trade buyers for about Pounds 350m. Like the 12 regional electricity companies (recs) in England and Wales it enjoys a monopoly to distribute power in the area it serves. Unlike them, it also transmits the power, a function that in England and Wales is undertaken by the National Grid. In theory NIE could face more competition than the recs in supplying electricity - that is buying it from generators and selling it on - but so far only one company, Northern Electric, has applied for a supply licence. NIE's penetration among the province's 1.5m population is much more limited than is that of the regional companies in England and Wales because oil and coal supply 81 per cent of the fuels market. This gives the company headroom for volume expansion, particularly as there is as yet no competition from gas and the population is relatively young and consumer goods oriented. But the most significant difference between NIE and the regional electricity companies is in the way they are regulated. The Northern Ireland electricity system is not linked to that in Great Britain, or indeed the Irish Republic, and it is regulated separately. Whereas the recs are negotiating with Ofer, their regulator, on changes to formulae influencing supply profits and will soon discuss the more lucrative distribution business, NIE's formulae for the next four years are already established. Dr Patrick Haren, chief executive, says this gives NIE more certainty. 'We are further down the track,' he says, pointing to the widespread belief that the reviews in England and Wales will follow examples set in the NIE regulation. The most significant formula is that governing transmission and distribution, which provides more than 80 per cent of company operating profits. In an attempt to encourage energy conservation, Mr Geoff Horton, the Northern Ireland regulator, has introduced a system whereby he regulates revenues rather than price per unit. Three quarters of total revenues are allowed to grow in real terms by 3.5 per cent annually but, for this three quarters, volume growth does not affect income. If volume growth exceeds expectations NIE must reduce prices in the following year, but if volume growth falls short NIE can increase tariffs. The effect is a highly secure revenue stream. Although this provides stability, it limits the advantages accruing from stronger volume growth than on the mainland. In addition it may take away an incentive for management to market aggressively, skills which may be needed later in the decade if British Gas decides to compete in the market on completion of a pipeline from the mainland. Dr Haren says the advantage of the regulatory regime is that NIE must concentrate on costs to generate increased profits in transmission and distribution. 'Recs can allow the economy to drive volume sales and profits. We have to be vigorous about cost management.' Jobs are an obvious target. In the last three years NIE has cut about 8 per cent of its workforce which now stands at about 3,700, but NIE still has six employees per thousand customers compared to the recs' 3.6. Although this is partly explained by the wide geographic base of NIE's operation, it leaves scope for further reductions as the company adopts the more rigorous practices of the private sector. The City believes that Dr Haren is well qualified to lead the management in this period of change. Still only 42, he joined NIE from the Electricity Supply Board in Eire where he started as an engineer, but later switched to finance. Generally, the management at NIE is perceived as well balanced in age and experience. 'They may not set the world alight but they are comparable with that at most recs and better than some,' says one analyst. In spite of inherent advantages they have at NIE, managers face two main challenges, one resulting from high capital expenditure needed over the next few years, the other from the political problems in Northern Ireland. Problems associated with terrorism can be exaggerated. As Hoare Govett points out, the government practice is to replace assets in Northern Ireland which are damaged through terrorism. None the less terrorism has been and remains a threat; the headquarters of the NIE was bombed in the 1970s and the interconnector with Eire was severed following terrorist action. Even if any attack on NIE had no impact on NIE's finances, it would be unlikely to leave the share price unscathed. The other inherent problem at NIE stems from the province's remoteness and the age of the transmission system, half of which dates from the 1950s or earlier. NIE is likely to have to pay Pounds 110m for an interconnector to Scotland which is planned for mid-1990s. Even without allowing for interconnector costs, Hoare Govett estimates capital expenditure to rise to Pounds 125m by 1995-6 from last year's Pounds 57m and Barclays de Zoete Wedd, NIE's financial adviser, says gearing could reach 65 per cent by 1996-7. However, Hoare Govett believes real dividend growth should be similar to the recs in the long term.   Companies:-  Northern Ireland Electricity.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Mr Molyneaux, who holds an effective veto over the prime minister's efforts, said the groundwork for all-party talks on devolved government could be completed within two weeks. Resumed talks should focus on the creation of the 85-seat legislative assembly - the model for which was drawn up in abortive talks last year. In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Molyneaux said there was 'a fair chance' that Mr Michael Ancram, the Northern Ireland minister, would be able 'within a week or two' to identify common ground between the province's political parties. That 'will enable us to start the process of restoring accountable democracy for Northern Ireland'. His comments came as Mr Major appeared to improve strained relations with the Rev Ian Paisley by telling the leader of the hard-line Democratic Unionist party that proposals for a political settlement leaked in Dublin last week were totally unacceptable. In spite of the latest setbacks, Downing Street signalled Mr Major's determination to press on with efforts to find a settlement by announcing that he had set up a group of senior ministers to oversee policy. Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, also sought to reassure unionist politicians that fears about Dublin's intentions were groundless. But Mr Molyneaux said the Major-Reynolds initiative was doomed. Dublin would give up its constitutional claim to Northern Ireland only in return for 'something which has the same effect as the territorial claim'. Asked if they should break off negotiations, he responded: 'Well, it's futile, isn't it, because unless they could get agreement to something which was as significant and acceptable to the IRA as joint authority leading on to Irish unity, then it is not going to make any difference to the so-called peace process.' It made sense for the two leaders to meet regularly: 'But what I think they ought to be realistic about is the fact that the two governments cannot really influence the decisions of Mr Adams and his cohorts in the IRA.' Mr Molyneaux said the Dublin proposals offer 'a structure that would bring about the unification of the national territory'. The draft paper had 'all the designs and a good many of the paragraphs' of the initiative launched by Mr John Hume, leader of the mainly Roman Catholic SDLP, and Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein. He described the Hume-Adams plan as a 'fiendishly clever operation' to secure Irish unification. Mr Major's search for a comprehensive agreement between London, Dublin and the Northern Ireland parties had 'lost a great deal of its validity', he said. The IRA could be defeated only by tougher security measures, Mr Molyneaux added. He backed the reintroduction of selective detention, or internment.

The economic implications of peace - if it lasts - would be complex. A recovery in Northern Ireland asset values and increased tourism in the Republic are among the possible outcomes. While there has been no rush to upgrade earnings forecasts, though, the ceasefire has certainly been good for sentiment and helped focus the attention of international investors on favourable fundamentals. While the Irish economy was stronger than most of its European peers through the recession, growth was driven by multinationals using Ireland as a base for exports. Yesterday's results from CRH, the building materials company, show that domestic demand is now starting to take over. Against that background the market looks cheap on a multiple of around 12 times this year's forecast earnings - even allowing for the large proportion of lowly-rated financial stocks in the market's capitalisation. The lingering doubt is that a market driven higher by international capital flows must also be vulnerable to a sudden change of sentiment. A further appreciation of the Irish punt - perhaps beyond parity with sterling - would raise fears about competitiveness. Still, if peace in Northern Ireland gives international investors one less reason to take fright, the market's latest gains should be sustainable.   Countries:-  IEZ  Ireland, EC.

0,FT921-5925 ,"FT921-5925 _AN-CCAAAAFMFT 920229   FT  29 FEB 92 / When Irish eyes smile: A possible coalition deal at Westminster      By RALPH ATKINS   Within 24 hours of election day, Mr John Major, the prime minister, may face an anguished choice between telephoning Mr James Molyneaux, leader of the Ulster Unionist party, or calling the removal men. With opinion polls suggesting that neither the Tories nor Labour will win a majority, a pact between the Conservatives and Unionist MPs is edging up the scale of possible outcomes. Although the Conservative party says an outright victory is its only aim, senior members of the party have weighed the possible gains and losses of a pact with Northern Ireland's unionists - the Ulster Unionist Party and the Democratic Unionist Party - and have considered how the wooing might be done. Mr Peter Brooke, Northern Ireland secretary, has acknowledged that a deal is possible, while Mr Major has not ruled it out. In the event of a hung parliament, such calculations would determine whether a minority Tory government could survive or whether Labour would be given a chance to form an administration. It could prevent an early second general election. The Ulster Unionist party is a likely first choice for Mr Major should he search for a coalition partner. The Liberal Democrats, now with 22 MPs, have strengthened their demands for electoral reform and would demand ministerial posts. If the election result is tight, a deal with the nine Ulster Unionist MPs (a number unlikely to change much in the election) may be enough for the Conservatives to hold on to power. Mr Molyneaux would probably seize a chance to influence the governance of Northern Ireland, particularly if the alternative were a Labour government and its policy of unification of Ireland by consent. But it would be a marriage of convenience rather than shared aspirations. Although the two parties have had close ties since the 19th century, a wedge was driven between them by the 1972 imposition of 'direct rule' from Westminster which ended Unionist control over government in the province. Ulster Unionists no longer take the Conservative whip, and they sit on the opposite side of the Commons chamber. Personalities would also clash. The 71-year-old Mr Molyneaux is a canny, old-school Westminster operator who dislikes undue media attention or high-tension negotiations. His colleagues are similarly unambitious, unused to the disciplines required to support a government with a fragile majority. No more than a handful are at Westminster for more than a day or two a week. Northern Ireland is their main concern. Views on other issues vary but are usually conservative, sometimes more so than the Conservative party. The Rev Ian Paisley, the voluble leader of the Democratic Unionist Party, and the DUP's two other MPs may also be persuaded to support the Conservatives. But Mr Paisley's rumbustious character makes any deal-making an unenviable task. In pursuing a pact, Mr Major's negotiating tactics might run something like this. First, Ulster Unionists would be offered an opt-out clause for Commons' votes affecting mainly the province but be expected to support the Tories in other areas. There might be some fudges. On parliament's endorsement of the Maastricht summit - an area where most Ulster Unionists would want to express disquiet, a minority Tory government could perhaps rely on sufficient votes from Liberal Democrat or Labour MPs. Second, the prime minister would meet some of the Unionists' demands. Mr Molyneaux wants a Commons select committee to scrutinise the administration of Northern Ireland business - long blocked by the government pending agreement on a devolved government in the province. Promises of fuller debate of Northern Ireland legislation would follow and then, possibly, more powers for local councils. The Unionists may ask for internment but could be satisfied by assurances of tighter security in the province. The Ulster Unionists would also push hard for a renegotiation of the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement which, they believe, gives the Irish government too much say in the running of Northern Ireland. That would pose difficulties for Mr Major. It is an internationally recognised treaty, at the centre of a a government policy of bringing Unionist and nationalist leaders to the negotiating table. Changes would have to be agreed with Dublin. In practice, however, government policy on Northern Ireland would already have been undermined. A Conservative-Ulster Unionist pact would end government claims to be a neutral arbiter of talks. Because Mr Brooke has championed such a neutral approach he would probably have to be replaced. 'Round-table' talks, involving all of the parties to the Northern Ireland troubles would be hard to achieve. The government would be playing to Mr Molyneaux's 'integrationist' instincts, ruling the province like any other part of the UK. Mr Major might find that prospect unpalatable. For many Tories, it would be an unwelcome step back towards the Unionist hegemony in Northern Ireland prior to 1972. It would also sour UK relations with the Irish government. Improved relations with Dublin have been central to Mr Major's initiative towards Northern Ireland. A pact with the Unionists would jeopardise that stance. It would not provide a coherent alternative. The result, given the lessons of two decades of 'troubles' in Northern Ireland, would probably be a continuing political vacuum in the province. Terrorism would not stop. Notwithstanding the gains for the Conservative party, Mr Major would have to decide whether it was a price worth paying to remain in Downing Street.

In comments made in Northern Ireland within hours of the reported abduction of the son of an ex-Sinn Fein councillor, Sir Patrick called for 'the greatest restraint and self-discipline' from all concerned. Those trying to provoke a return to violence 'must not succeed', he said. Sir Patrick said: 'I don't know if it's the case in this instance, but we must expect there will be people who don't wish to see an end to violence and who will be trying to provoke a return to violence. 'Whenever peace comes after a long period of conflict there is a risk hardline extremists will try and provoke a return to violence.' The disappearance of Mr Paul Carroll was the first apparently politically motivated incident in Northern Ireland since the declaration of a loyalist ceasefire two weeks ago. Last night the mystery surrounding Mr Carroll deepened when his father said that his son was 'in safe hands' and was in hiding from the police because he was an informer. Mr Tommy Carroll contradicted an earlier statement by members of his family that his son had been abducted from his home against his will by masked men. Police sources in Armagh City said that Mr Carroll had no terrorist convictions and was not known to be linked with any terrorist organisation. However, because of the staunchly republican credentials of members of his family, police were working on the theory that he may have been abducted as part of an internal feud possibly linked to the IRA. Two of Mr Carroll's uncles were shot in separate terrorist-related incidents in the 1980s. Roddy Carroll, a member of the INLA, an extremist group that split from the IRA, was shot by police allegedly involved in a shoot-to-kill policy. A second uncle, Adrian, was murdered by loyalist paramilitaries. Loyalist politicians representing Protestant paramilitaries were in New York yesterday. They were expected to meet low-ranking administration officials. The loyalists, led by Mr Gusty Spence, a former paramilitary and a convicted murderer, and Mr David Ervine, who has also been in prison on bomb-related offences, said they were prepared to meet with Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing. The loyalist groups, unlike constitutional unionist parties, have no misgivings about Dublin's proposed cross-border institutions, as long as it is not a 'Trojan horse leading to a united Ireland'. Yesterday's events came as Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, told the Dail that the framework document with which the two governments hope to inject momentum into talks involving Ulster's main political parties on the province's future had to strike a 'very fine balance'. Meanwhile, Ms Maire Geoghegan-Quinn, Irish justice minister, told the Dail the government would act soon to scrap the republic's state of emergency, effectively available as an anti-IRA measure for more than half a century.

Paradoxically, the closer the relationship between the two governments, the further apart seem the province's nationalist and unionist political parties. In spite of the governments' efforts, attempts to restart round-table political talks have stalled. Originally expected this month or next, a resumption is now unlikely before the autumn. Nobody in London or Dublin predicts a breakthrough today. In large part, the deadlock is due to Unionists' fears. Since the 1985 Anglo-Irish agreement allowed Dublin to have a small, but symbolically important say in the affairs of the north, Northern Ireland's majority population has seen the Conservative party drift away from the Unionist cause. British policy - that Northern Ireland is part of the UK as long a majority of its population wishes to stay - has not encouraged Unionists to believe its constitutional position is safe. The warmth between Mr Major and Mr Reynolds, with none of the testy inter-governmental exchanges that often characterised the 1980s, does not help calm suspicions. The hope that originally teased Unionists into the first set of round-table talks in 1990 - that the 1985 agreement would be torn up under a new London/Dublin/Belfast deal - has evaporated. Now the Rev Ian Paisley, populist Democratic Unionist party leader, is refusing to enter talks until the republic renounces its constitutional claim on the north. Mr Paisley is also irked by talks between Mr John Hume, leader of the mainly Roman Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party, and Sinn Fein. With local elections last month proving disappointing for the more moderate Ulster Unionist party, its leader Mr James Molyneaux has also hardened his position, complaining that uncertainty created by talks involving Dublin is costing lives. His argument has a robust logic; Loyalist terrorists are proving as deadly as the IRA, while last week's Opsahl report on the province, by an independent commission, said Britain's reluctance to set out a blueprint was adding to instability and distrust. British ministers respond that a history of failed political initiatives shows there is no alternative to the search for widely acceptable agreement from within the province. However Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, is drawing up 'sketch plans' for new arrangements in the province, to replace the present 'direct rule' from Westminster. The initiative, agreed against the advice of some in the Northern Ireland Office, followed the last intervention in Northern Ireland by Mr Major in April. Sir Patrick's colleagues believe he is philosophical about the intransigence of nationalists and Unionists, judging that solutions may only evolve over years, rather than months. In that long run, prime ministerial summits will not make much difference either. An extra Pounds 24m is to be spent on the economic regeneration programme in Belfast, Sir Patrick Mayhew said yesterday. The cash will allow 30 new schemes, including a crime-prevention project for north and west Belfast. It brings to Pounds 124m the amount set aside for the Making Belfast Work initiative aimed at boosting economic development and education in some of the city's most troubled and deprived areas.

It was damaged by IRA bombs in the early 1970s. The North-South Interconnector is one of a number of cross-border initiatives dusted off in the wake of the paramilitary ceasefires. The move will result in savings for both NIE and the Electricity Supply Board, the republic's power utility. The link will improve load management efficiencies, allowing both companies to cover temporary power shortfalls. It will also provide trading opportunities for NIE to sell to the republic. NIE said it was 'still talking about contracts'. ESB estimated that the project could result in savings of IPounds 500,000 (Pounds 495,000) a year. The restoration would increase the viability of NIE's proposed Pounds 175m power link with Scotland, which is the subject of a public inquiry that should be completed by February. An NIE official said yesterday that the two projects were 'perfectly complementary and in line with European energy policy'. If the link with ScottishPower is approved both Irish grids will be integrated into the European network for the first time - there is already a link between England and France. The European Union has backed the Ulster-Scotland link with a Pounds 61m grant. Mr Geoffrey Horton, the Northern Ireland electricity regulator, is reviewing the NIE/ScottishPower link after a request from the province's consumer committee. As part of his review Mr Horton is looking at alternative proposals, including one from Meekatharra Minerals, the loss-making Australian mining company, to build a lignite power plant near Ballymoney in County Antrim.

Addressing backbenchers from the British and Irish  parliaments at a meeting of the interparliamentary body in  Dublin, Mr Reynolds said he remained hopeful that last  December's joint declaration would produce results -- but added  that he was disappointed with progress to date.    There had been ""little new evidence"" that the two  communities  in the province were likely to reach agreement if ""left to  themselves."" The two governments would have to play a role ""in  encouraging, and maybe to some degree formulating an outline of  an agreement between them,"" he said. The joint declaration made  both governments ""effectively persuaders for an agreement.""    Earlier this month Mr Reynolds revealed that the two  governments had begun drafting a ""framework document"" around  which a future political settlement might be built.    But in his clearest acknowledgement yet that the peace  process has in effect stalled, Mr Reynolds cast doubt on whether  Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, has the coherence and  unity to deliver on its stated desire for a peace deal, and  called for a more ""enlightened"" leadership from the unionist  parties.    He added that both governments ""would be anxious and willing  to break the present impasse"" if Sinn Fein made clear what  issues it still wanted clarified.    His remarks came as Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland  secretary, urged Sinn Fein to specify in what respects they  believed the document to be unclear.    The government had had to conclude that what ""clarification""  really meant was ""renegotiation,"" Sir Patrick said. ""We are not  getting into that,"" he said. ""Nor are the Irish government.""    Sir Patrick said that the declaration's non-partisan  approach  meant nobody needed to fear that their position would be  ""ignored or excluded."" The ending of violence in Northern  Ireland was ""a prize that threatens no one."" He added: ""It  should relegate confrontation to the past.""     "

In a carefully worded message on the eve of Sinn Fein's annual conference in Dublin, the prime minister will attempt to tip the debate within the republican movement in favour of accepting the Downing Street declaration. In today's Irish News, the Belfast-based nationalist newspaper, Mr Major is expected to offer the most detailed exposition to date of the way ahead for republicans once the joint declaration has been accepted. He was backed yesterday by a call from Mr Albert Reynolds, his Irish counterpart, for republican acceptance of the declaration. Mr Reynolds urged Sinn Fein to adopt a policy of non-coercion of Ulster's Protestants. He said: 'What the peace declaration offers is a future free of coercion, British or Irish, loyalist or republican. That is the huge psychological step that we are asking not just republicans, but everyone, to take.' It also emerged yesterday that Mr Michael Ancram, the Northern Ireland minister, is ready to begin more detailed discussions with the province's constitutional parties. Mr Ancram expects within days to start exploring the parties' reaction to the checklist of ideas drawn up earlier this month by Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary. The talks are to run alongside discussions between officials in London and Dublin on proposals for a new political settlement. Ministers hope for progress on both elements of the talks process by the next Anglo-Irish intergovernmental conference on March 10. Against a background of mounting unionist hostility towards the direction of the UK-Irish political initiative, the Ulster Unionists - the province's largest party - will on Monday publish its proposals for a settlement. These will focus mainly on a devolved government for Ulster. Although a definitive Sinn Fein response to the Downing Street declaration is not expected to emerge from the conference, due to a stand-off between Sinn Fein and the UK over the issue of 'clarification', Dublin has in effect pointed to a way in which the deadlock might be broken. Mr Reynolds referred positively to a recent article by Mr Mitchel McLoughlin, Sinn Fein's Northern Ireland chairman, stating that Protestants in the province should not be coerced into a united Ireland. If the Sinn Fein conference were to make 'a clear endorsement of a policy of non-coercion' of the unionists, this would represent 'an immense step forward', Mr Reynolds said.

The commission learned about the proposals last month from Mr Kevin McNamara, the Labour spokesman on Northern Ireland, only after the plans had in turn been leaked to him through a third party unconnected with the government. The NIO said: 'The consultative exercise has gone well, and when it is concluded ministers will be informed of its outcome and invited to consider the way forward.' This was disputed yesterday by members of the commission, who indicated that the consultation had strained relations with the NIO. The government is also facing opposition not to the principle of combating terrorist funding but the way it is proposing to deal with the problem from bodies which were initially consulted on both sides of industry. Mr Nigel Smyth, the CBI's Northern Ireland director, said the working paper implied excessive regulation which could unfairly discriminate against small and medium-sized companies. The Irish Congress of Trade Unions said the proposals had civil liberty implications and were in part impractical. The high cost of fighting terrorism has left the Royal Ulster Constabulary short of cash and diverting funds from reserves set aside for buying vital computer equipment, senior police sources in the province said yesterday. The overtime bill for the last financial year was nearly Pounds 70m.   Countries:-  IEZ  Ireland, EC.   Industries:-  P9711 National Security.     P9229 Public Order and Safety, NEC.

The outcome of talks between Mr Peter Brooke, Northern Ireland secretary, and the party leaders in Belfast undermined hopes that anything other than a symbolic first meeting could start before the election. Mr Brooke expressed optimism that talks could start 'as soon as possible'. However, in spite of the optimism created by the unexpected deal between Unionist and nationalist leaders late last week on resuming talks, it appears significant details have still to be worked out. Mr Brooke will meet Irish ministers on Friday when he will set out the Northern Ireland parties' positions and test whether any fresh conditions they may have proposed for talks are acceptable to the Dublin government. The local leaders also want written assurances from Mr John Major and Mr Neil Kinnock, Labour leader, that talks will continue on the same basis whatever the general election result. A starting date of next Monday for talks seems improbable. The talks, which collapsed in July, are unlikely to restart in earnest until after the election, which is expected to be called by the end of next week. Meanwhile, Northern Ireland clergymen who met Loyalist paramilitary leaders last month said they would be prepared to meet representatives of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, in the interests of peace. Separately, Cardinal Cahal Daly, the Roman Catholic Primate of All Ireland, said on BBC Radio that he would not be surprised if individual priests were meeting the IRA 'because of the tremendous desire for peace there is in all sections of the community.' However, he stressed that the church would not act as political intermediaries.  The Financial Times   London Page 24  "

The plan emerged yesterday as Mr John Major, the prime minister, underlined the government's determination to press ahead with talks in an effort to wrest back the initiative from Sinn Fein after Mr Gerry Adams' highly publicised visit to the US this week. Mr Major told MPs at question time that progress in the province 'cannot and will not wait for Sinn Fein'. The government would 'actively carry forward the political talks with the constitutional parties and with the Irish government'. The delicacy of the task was highlighted when Dublin reacted frostily to a suggestion by Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, in a Financial Times interview that London would bring forward its proposals for a political settlement in the next two weeks. Mr Dick Spring, Irish foreign minister, said in a terse statement that it was 'important' the British paper be 'directed to the achievement of the objective which the two governments have jointly set themselves, namely a comprehensive political settlement which addresses all the main relationships'. Mr John Hume, leader of the mainly Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party, said he would not accept any variation from the so-called 'three-stranded' format, covering relationships in the province, between north and south, and between London and Dublin. According to Sir Patrick, London's fresh ideas will cover devolved government in Northern Ireland and formal mechanisms for enhancing cross-border co-operation. 'Strand Three,' he said, 'is for the two governments'. Mr Peter Robinson, deputy leader of the hardline Democratic Unionists, who are boycotting the talks, said yesterday that the party would not participate in talks 'either under the aegis of the Anglo-Irish agreement or the Downing Street Declaration'. The UUP paper, which the party is aiming to publish before Sinn Fein holds its party conference on February 26 and 27, is expected to argue that a blueprint for devolved government in the province - agreed between the constitutional parties - is needed before progress can be made on cross-border co-operation. Drawn up after consultation with grassroots unionists, it is expected to flesh out the 'blueprint for stability' proposed by Mr James Molyneaux, the UUP leader, in March. It is likely to suggest that an Ulster assembly should start life with few if any legislative powers. Meanwhile, Mr Adams was heckled and jostled yesterday by victims of IRA violence when he arrived in Dublin. Political notebook, Page 9   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Mr Major also confirmed that he will meet the leaders of the four non-violent Northern Ireland parties shortly for a round of bilateral discussions on the peace process. In Belfast police revealed that a man is to be charged in connection with the Hallowe'en massacre of seven people in Greysteel, County Londonderry. A second is likely to be accused of withholding information. Downing Street said Mr Major called for a review of the broadcasting rules after seeing recent interviews with Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing. Mr Major was said to have been disturbed by the use of actors reading synchronised scripts, to get round restrictions preventing transmission of Mr Adams' voice. In the Commons the prime minister told Dame Jill Knight, a Conservative backbencher, that the use of actors 'stretched the present guidelines to the limit, and perhaps beyond'. The review will be carried out by Mr Peter Brooke, the heritage secretary, who has primary responsibility for broadcasting law. Mr Brooke, who is understood to have been given a free hand to recommend any changes he thinks necessary, is expected to consult Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, and Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary. However, he is not expected to bow to demands from Dame Jill and other Conservatives for a ban on all broadcast interviews with Sinn Fein. Downing Street said Mr Major would begin seeing Northern Ireland political leaders tomorrow. The first meetings are expected to be with Dr John Alderdice, leader of the moderate unionist Alliance party, and Mr John Hume, leader of the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party. The prime minister's office is trying to arrange meetings with the Reverend Ian Paisley, leader of the hardline Democratic Unionist party, and Mr James Molyneaux, leader of the Ulster Unionist party, the biggest unionist grouping. The round of meetings is intended to stress Mr Major's availability to all political leaders in Northern Ireland who reject the use of violence. It follows the prime minister's decision to accept a request for a meeting from Mr Hume, who wants to discuss his talks on prospects for peace with Mr Adams. However, the meetings will also allow Mr Major to lay the groundwork for round-table talks at which the government has promised to set out fresh peace proposals.

But he keeps quiet about it, and is little known  outside of Westminster. Not for him bursts of oratory in the  Commons chamber, regular television soundbites or loud threats  delivered outside Downing Street. His preference is for a much  more effective course -- the short walk down a corridor in the  Houses of Parliament for a private word in the Prime Minister's  room. He is James Molyneux, leader of the Ulster Unionists, a  shrewd wheeler-dealer, the ultimate Commons fixer.    He holds the balance of power in the present Parliament,  just  as he did in Callaghan's Labour government between 1974 and  1979. The nine Ulster Unionist votes have saved John Major's  Government since the general election in 1992 and will do so  again. Everyone at Westminster believes Major and Molyneux have  a secret deal, as journalists like to describe it, or an  understanding, as MPs prefer to put it: the result is the same  however it is described, the survival of the Major Government.    Given the immense power he holds, Molyneux's behaviour over  the last few months has been puzzling. Why has this man,  steeped in the Unionist tradition, the leading voice of Ulster  Protestantism, been so relaxed about the Downing Street  Declaration? Surely, an agreement between London and Dublin  talking about self-determination for the whole island of Ireland  would have sent a shiver through the man who holds a senior  position in the Orange Order, Sovereign Grand Master of its  Royal Black Preceptor?    Yet on the December day that the declaration was announced  Molyneux had little to say, in contrast to the Rev lan Paisley,  leader of the smaller, hard-line Democratic Unionist Party, who  denounced it as a sell-out to ""buy off the fiendish Republican  scum.""    One piece of speculation was that Molyneux, aged 73 and  possibly coming close to retirement, wanted a legacy, a peace  settlement for Northern Ireland, to go down in history as the  man able to rise above his own particular brand of politics, an  Ulster Gorbachev. As a piece of speculation, it is complete  nonsense.    In a lengthy interview with THE SCOTSMAN, Molyneux explained  in detail for the first time why he was so relaxed about the  Downing Street Declaration. The reason was not that he had  mellowed but that he had successfully fought the Unionist  corner. He told how in behind-the-scenes meetings with the  Prime Minister, an original 30-paragraph Irish document was  slashed down to the 12 paragraphs that eventually appeared. He  neutralised it, removing anything of any substance, any  mechanisms that would have required action or set up joint  British-Irish structures. The final declaration was ""a muddled,  tortuous one,"" and ""while one didn't like the wording, it didn't  pose any threat to the Union.""    The naive optimism that greeted the Downing Street  Declaration, a hope that it would bring an end to the killing  fields, has long since dissipated. Molyneux's explanation of  how he neutered the document explains why. He does not believe  the Irish Republican Army will accept the document.    ""I never did think they would do it. They might have been a  bit more sympathetic if the British Government had agreed to the  30 paragraphs.... Once it was denuded of the mechanisms, it was  no good for them,"" he said.    Critics of Molyneux, while acknowledging his shrewdness and  political skill, say his biggest failure is his inability to  take the wider view of Irish politics. A member of the Social  Democratic and Labour Party, Northern Ireland's democratic  nationalists, complained: ""We are interested in the  relationship between Northern Ireland and Dublin. He is only  interested in who rules in Northern Ireland.""    The other complaint is that he is too fond of Westminster.  ""He is very proud of being Right Honourable and will get a  peerage in due course,"" said one source close to Northern  Ireland politics.    This is true. But there is more to Molyneux's interest in  the Commons than just prestige: Molyneux has used it as a  powerbase, not only to consolidate Unionist power but to  strengthen it.    He has only once made a mistake, when he misread Thatcher.  He did not believe she would sign the British-lrish agreement  of 1985; but she did. He has not made any mistakes since, at  least from a Unionist point of view.    Molyneux's public visage is usually blank or mournful  looking, typically Presbyterian, though in private he is  cheerful and is often described as clubbable, the Westminster  phraseology for being easy-going. To Molyneux, having a blank  face is a compliment. He tells of how a party colleague, John  Taylor, turned to him after they had won a key vote, with order  papers being waved all around them: ""The trouble with you is  that we can never tell whether you are glad or sad about  anything.""    Molyneux said that on that occasion, as on others, he was  thinking ahead, his mind already moving on to battles that lay  ahead: not for him exuberant displays or histrionics on the  night of a famous victory. Politics, for him, is about  patience, about taking the long view.    Molyneux, as part of the price of supporting Major, has  succeeded in blocking proposals to privatise water in Northen  Ireland and in gaining agreement on a select committee for  Northern Ireland affairs, seeing the latter as a way of bringing  even closer ties to the mainland.    But his greatest service to Unionism came in the months  running up to the Downing Street Declaration. He said the  document first surfaced in the Irish Press on 19 November,  consisting of 30 paragraphs and confirmed by the Irish  Taoiseach, Albert Reynolds, as authentic. Paisley and other  Ulster politicians went to see Major and made very public  statements afterwards.    Molyneux made few such statements and instead saw Major  about  twice a week in private. He could barely conceal, during the  interview, his sense of satisfaction at the outcome. The other  party leaders have to ask themselves, said Molyneux, who was  responsible for removing the contentious parts from the original  Irish document. From memory, he recited in detail a paragraph  that would have set up a joint British-Irish convention that  would have exercised a lot of power over a Northern Ireland  Assembly.    ""Now this is not in the document. And now there isn't in it  anything, as opposed to when there were 30 paragraphs, not even  one cog or wheel of mechanism anywhere in it. It is just a  muddled statement of principles and aspirations and all the rest  of it but not a single commitment to do anything, unlike the  Anglo-lrish agreement which says `there shall be established,  the chief constable shall do this, that and the other, the army  commander shall do this.' There is no `shall' or even `may' in  it [The Downing Street Declaration],"" he said.    His one concession was to Dublin's idea for a Forum for  Peace, an all-lreland political convention.    ""The only thing I reluctantly...not reluctantly but which I  thought there was no harm in acquiescing to...was Reynolds  having a forum `within his jurisdiction.' These words were put  in deliberately. He can have a talking shop if he wants to. We  are not involved. The British Government is not involved. They  can do what they like. It is in their own sovereign territory.""    He does not rule out a meeting with Reynolds, who sent him a  ""friendly"" letter in December to which Molyneux sent a reply  simply acknowledging receipt. But Molyneux is not particularly  interested in relations between Northern Ireland and Dublin.  What he considers to be much more significant is internal  democracy and the talks have been underway since last September  with the Northern Ireland minister of state, Michael Ancram,  about setting up an Assembly.    This has attracted interest in Scotland, where the argument  is that if Northern Ireland can have a legislative Assembly, why  not Scotland.    But Molyneux makes it clear that while the Government may  want a legislative Assembly, he does not, and what Molyneux  wants, he invariably gets. His plan is for a nonlegislative  85-member Assembly, a sort of glorified local government. It  would be more like Strathclyde Regional Council than a  full-blown Scottish Parliament as proposed by Labour.    If legislation was needed, this could be done by getting  private bills put through the Commons, just as English councils  do at present. He concedes that if the Assembly worked and  became a mature body, there might in the future be a case for  adding legislative powers.    Molyneux, who fought in the RAF [Royal Air Force] during the  Second World War, found himself on the Normandy beaches on  D-Day. It was partly an accident, having been transferred only a  few days earlier by a commanding officer who did not like him.  A lot of his life has been an accident.    He has been an MP since 1970 -- first for Antrim South and  now for the Lagan Valley -- and leader of the Unionists since  1974.    As Major's Commons majority of 17 dwindles further as a  result of inevitable by-election defeats, Molyneux's role over  the next few years will become more, not less, important.    In January 1985, Douglas Hurd, then Home Secretary,  frustrated by the intransigence of Molyneux and Paisley,  complained that ""the Unionist tail cannot go on wagging the  British dog forever."" The British dog has never been so  vigorously wagged as it is at present.     "

A 24-year-old off-duty police constable opened fire at Sinn Fein's west Belfast advice centre about lunchtime, killing three and injuring two others. He later shot himself dead. It was the first time in more than two decades of 'troubles' that a member of the Royal Ulster Constabulary has carried out an attack in such circumstances. Mrs Mary Robinson, president of the Irish Republic, was about a mile away when the shooting occurred. Unionist leaders organised a demonstration against her visit in protest at articles two and three of the Irish constitution which lay claim to jurisdiction over Northern Ireland. Mr Nigel Dodds, the lord mayor of Belfast, said: 'I don't think that she can be welcome as long as those articles remain.' Previous Irish presidents have visited Northern Ireland in the past, but in an unofficial capacity, for example to attend funerals of victims of paramilitary killings. The west Belfast attack came as thousands gathered in the city centre to demand an end to terrorist murder and intimidation of workers. The rally, organised by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, was called following the IRA killings last month of eight Protestant workers at Teebane Crossroads near Cookstown. The police constable gained admission to the advice centre, which also houses the Republican Press Centre, by posing as a journalist who had arranged an interview. Once inside, he opened fire with an automatic shotgun. Eye witnesses said he later escaped in a BMW car. About two hours later, the policeman's body was found on the shores of Loch Neagh at Ballinderry, about 25 miles from Belfast. He had a gunshot wound to the head and a shotgun was found nearby. The day before, the constable had attended the funeral of a police colleague at Comber, County Down. He was arrested after firing shots over the grave later that evening. Subsequently he was medically and scientifically examined and police took possession of his service Ruger revolver. He was told to attend a further examination yesterday morning but did not turn up, the RUC said last night. An police inquiry is under way into the killings. One of the dead was an elderly doorman and the other victims were a centre worker and a member of the public. Mrs Robinson said she was upset by the killing, saying: 'Any death by violence is distressing.' Mr Brian Mawhinney, Northern Ireland minister responsible for security, said the deaths were 'an absolute tragedy, as is all waste of life in Northern Ireland'.

It is one of the biggest inward investment projects won so far by the province's Industrial Development Board. The plant, at Mallusk on the outskirts of Belfast, will start production early in 1994 with full staffing expected by 1998. Valence already has a Pounds 65m agreement to supply batteries from the plant to Motorola, the world's biggest maker of portable radios and cellular communication products. It also has a Pounds 13m contract with Delco Remy, a subsidiary of General Motors, to develop Valence technology for automotive uses. Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, said the plant would become Valence's main production centre for the new battery, selling to customers worldwide. He added: 'I am also pleased that Valence are showing the depth of their confidence in Northern Ireland's technological expertise by setting up a research and development facility here.' Mr Cal Reed, Valence president, said Ulster was chosen because 'it is a good fit with our strategic plan in that a supportive pro-business climate exists and we have access to a good workforce, particularly university-educated engineers, making it possible for us to begin production as soon as possible'. Valence's battery is based on lithium and polymer technologies and the company's decision to locate in Northern Ireland will give the province direct contact with decision makers in the electronics companies of Silicon Valley in the US. The company has been making prototypes at its San Jose plant since 1991 and claims the battery now ready to move into production has a longer operating life and reduced size and weight. Mr Reed said: 'Our batteries offer significant advantages over the much heavier conventional batteries which currently power cellphones, portable computers, camcorders and hand-held tools.' Seagate Technology - another 'Valley' company - will start production in Londonderry next year, making components for computer disc drives and eventually employing 500 people. Sir Patrick said the decision by the IDB to open its first office in Silicon Valley had been validated by the two investments.   Companies:-  Valence Technology.

The two leaders will consider joint proposals for a new constitutional settlement which includes fundamental changes to the Irish constitution and the creation of a number of powerful executive boards to increase cross-border co-operation. They are determined to regain the initiative at the end of a week of escalating violence, which started last Saturday with an IRA bomb which killed 10 people in the mainly Protestant Shankill Road. The bloodshed continued last night with the shooting dead of two Catholic brothers, aged 18 and 20, in the living room of their home at Bleary, near Warringstown, Co Down. Loyalists were blamed for the murders. The proposals, drafted in outline over recent weeks by a working party of civil servants from London and Dublin, would provide an 'umbrella' for the restart of negotiations between political parties in the province. The move is also designed to sideline the parallel talks between Mr John Hume, leader of the Social Democratic and Labour Party, and Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, and persuade the parties to talk again. Dublin, however, wants some of the Hume-Adams proposals included in a broader settlement. The outcome of today's meeting, at the margins of the European summit in Brussels, may not be spelled out in detail given the political sensitivity of the peace process. But they will form the basis for more talks next week between Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, and Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary. The 'guiding principles' for any agreement, set out this week in the Dublin parliament by Mr Spring, received a strong positive response from London yesterday. Officials stress that the provisions of this fresh joint Irish-UK initiative would only come into effect as part of an overall settlement. That in turn would depend on agreement between the SDLP and the Unionist parties on the shape of internal political arrangements in the province to replace government from Westminster. Both sides acknowledge that considerable obstacles remain. But at the heart of any intergovernmental settlement would be a commitment by the republic to replace its constitutional claim to jurisdiction over Northern Ireland with an aspiration to achieve a united Ireland. It return Britain would formally acknowledge the legitimacy of that aspiration and would agree to the establishment of a number of cross-border executive boards in such areas as transport, dealings with the European Community's social funds and tourism. Mr Spring's clear declaration that the consent of the people of Northern Ireland was essential for any change in the status of the province was warmly welcomed in Downing Street. Mr Major told MPs he looked forward to discussing the 'positive' proposals with Mr Reynolds. There was acknowledgment in Whitehall that the peace process drawn up by Mr Hume and Mr Adams still presents political hazards for any intergovernmental settlement. Mr Reynolds, who is expected to outline the Hume-Adams plan in today's meeting, believes some elements could be incorporated into an agreement between the two governments. Dublin also believes it must take seriously the prospect of an IRA ceasefire.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.     IEZ  Ireland, EC.   Industries:-  P9711 National Security.

0,FT934-5663 ,"FT934-5663 _AN-DK2DYACNFT 931129   FT  29 NOV 93 / Leading Article: Talking to the IRA   Anyone who seeks peace in Northern Ireland, at an honourable price, should support Mr John Major today. The prime minister has been charged with duplicity, on the ground that his government has sanctioned secret contacts with the Irish Republican Army in spite of its frequent protestations that it would never negotiate with terrorists. This is a setback for those who believe that governments must at all times behave like boy scouts, but the alternative would have been worse. Public deal-making with Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, could not be countenanced by a democratically elected British administration unless the bombers of Warrington and the Shankill Road turned convincingly away from violence. Yet a refusal to keep open unofficial lines of communication would have denied the government the chance to make its own position plain, and to take note of any peace proposals coming from the other side. The Israelis spent some time in secret conclave with the Palestine Liberation Organisation before emerging in public with their recent deal. Mr Major has not gone nearly as far as that, nor could he even if he wanted to: unlike Israel, he is not in the business of trading territory for peace. Constitutional future British policy is clear. If the IRA lays down its arms, and an unspecified period of 'quarantine' has passed, Sinn Fein can join talks about the constitutional future of Northern Ireland. Relations with the republic of Ireland will be discussed with Dublin. Any proposals arising from such talks would have to be endorsed by the voters of Northern Ireland. The unionists would therefore retain their veto on any plan to move towards a united Ireland - a point Mr Major again needs to make plain today. Republicans would have to persuade them to change their minds. The IRA is thus invited to abandon its campaign of violence and to rely on Sinn Fein's re-entry to the political process. It can show whether its talk of peace has any substance by picking up that invitation today. Mr Major, who has placed himself at the head of a drive to seek a political settlement of the troubles, has behaved with courage, and a sense of responsibility. Certainly, as an FT report shows today, his peace initiative is in tune with business opinion in Ulster. It also reflects the feelings of most ordinary people. The prime minister aims to take advantage of a tide of popular feeling in favour of peace, while not abandoning the unionists and their right of veto. He is therefore standing by his Northern Ireland secretary, Sir Patrick Mayhew, who has no reason to resign. The latter has said that the documents relating to back-door communications with the IRA will be published today. It must be presumed these will confirm that the long-standing and oft-repeated government promise to the Unionists, that the people of Northern Ireland will be able to determine their own future, will be seen to have been respected. Limit the damage Northern Ireland being what it is, this will not satisfy everyone. The cries of 'betrayal' from the Reverend Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionists are routine; the more measured response from Mr Molyneaux's larger unionist party suggests that it may be possible to limit the damage to the prime minister's peace initiative. It is often remarked that the government depends on unionist votes to shore up its uncertain parliamentary majority, but, against that, the unionists depend on the continuance in office of the Conservatives. To Ulster ears, Labour sounds pro-republican. A greater danger lies on the right wing of Mr Major's own party, where pro-unionist speeches have recently been made by Lord Tebbit and the former chancellor, Mr Norman Lamont. Initial reactions to the weekend's news, notably from Mr Lamont, suggest that the damage may be containable. With luck, and skill in handling the house of commons, Mr Major and Sir Patrick should be able to weather today's political storm. Assuming that they do, there should be no hesitation in pressing on with the peace initiative. The next step for the prime minister will be to confirm the date for his planned summit meeting with Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister. Friday would not be too soon.

The first bomb last Thursday, which contained 1,000lbs of home-made explosive, exploded near the headquarters of the Ulster Unionist party in Belfast, causing damage estimated at Pounds 6.5m. A 1,000lb bomb exploded in the centre of Portadown in County Armagh on Saturday morning, causing Pounds 8m damage. On Sunday, a 300lb bomb caused Pounds 2.5m damage to the Drumkeen hotel in Belfast, and was followed in the evening by another 1,000lb bomb in the town of Magherafelt in south Londonderry, which devastated its commercial centre and caused Pounds 5m damage. Speaking in Londonderry yesterday, Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland Secretary, said: 'We have been through a hard period of four days. There may be more to come; I cannot guarantee that there will not. What I can guarantee is that the IRA are not going to succeed.' The new bombing campaign has been met with calls from unionist leaders for a return of internment of IRA suspects. Mr John Taylor, an Ulster Unionist MP, said the security situation in the province was 'deteriorating' and called on Sir Patrick to introduce internment and identity cards. Mr Sammy Wilson, an official of the Democratic Unionist party warned at the weekend that 'many sincere young men' from the Protestant community will take the law into their own hands if the security forces do not crack down on IRA suspects. Sir Patrick was conferring with police and Army chiefs in the province yesterday, but it is unlikely that he will be rushed into action. When internment was first used in the 1970s it provoked a violent backlash from the nationalist community, and was generally considered a political blunder. Today Sir Patrick and Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, are meeting in Dublin in the latest of Anglo-Irish conference meetings. The main item on the agenda will be how to get the province's political parties back around the negotiating table to discuss a new political framework for Northern Ireland.

Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, and Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, have asked a joint working party of civil servants to present the draft by the end of October. Their decision, agreed privately at this month's meeting of the Anglo-Irish conference, reflects the growing view in London that the two governments have only a narrow window of opportunity to restart the political process. But there was uncertainty last night over whether the weekend initiative by Mr John Hume, the SDLP leader, and Mr Gerry Adams, the leader of Sinn Fein, would hinder the process. The initiative was greeted by some in Ireland as offering the best prospects for peace in more than 20 years. The SDLP and Sinn Fein, in a joint report to be delivered to the US and Irish governments, have proposed appointing a US mediator to break the political impasse in Northern Ireland. Mr John Major, the prime minister, was given an outline of the proposals by Mr Hume two weeks ago in London. Mr Hume made it clear he wanted to break out of the present framework for negotiations. But Sir Patrick insists there can be no negotiations with Sinn Fein until it unequivocally renounces violence. At the heart of the settlement under discussion between London and Dublin would be a commitment by the republic to replace its constitutional claim to jurisdiction over Ulster with an 'aspiration' to achieve a united Ireland. London would acknowledge in return that if ever a majority in the province favoured re-unification then it would respect that view and pass the necessary legislation. It would also agree to a significant extension of cross-border co-operation involving the creation of joint executive boards in such areas as transport, tourism and relations with the European Community. The aim of the draft is to create an 'umbrella' under which the Protestant and Catholic political parties in the province could be persuaded to resume the round-table talks on internal political arrangements which broke down last year. In parallel, Mr Michael Ancram, the Northern Ireland minister responsible for political affairs, is engaged in an intensive round of contacts with the Unionists and with the mainly Catholic SDLP. Sir Patrick is said to be 'hopeful' rather than optimistic that the approach will succeed. He has been encouraged, however, by a number of recent developments, including the decision by Mr Ian Paisley, the leader of the Democratic Unionists, to table his own proposals for a political settlement. There is a growing feeling in London that Mr Paisley fears he could be outflanked by the official Ulster Unionists, led by Mr James Molyneaux. There is a growing view among many senior ministers that the next few months could offer the last chance of a settlement during the lifetime of the present parliament. By January the parties in the province will be launching their campaigns for the local and European elections. Mr Hume and Mr Adams have been involved in bilateral talks since last April. In a weekend statement they said: 'We are convinced from our discussions that a process can be designed to lead to agreement among the divided people of this island, which will provide a solid basis for peace. Such a process would obviously also be designed to ensure that any new agreement that might emerge respects the diversity of our different traditions and earns their allegiance and agreement'. A spokesman for the SDLP said the joint proposals meant Sinn Fein was effectively a partner in the negotiations. Unionist leaders last night urged the British government to reject Sinn Fein's claims to be a party in the talks. Sinn Fein enters peace process, Page 10   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

The Ulster Unionist leader said Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, would have to wait until at least five years after agreeing to a permanent cessation of violence before it could be considered for admission into the democratic process. Other criminals were 'not usually considered for parole until they have served five years of their sentence'. Sinn Fein would also have to consent to the handover of IRA weapons and the identification of IRA explosive dumps. Interviewed on the BBC, Mr Molyneaux said it would not be difficult to establish a workable Northern Ireland assembly 'in the fairly short term'. This body would start with 'modest administrative powers', but as the constitutional parties became accustomed to working together 'they would acquire trust and confidence . . . and then who knows where it would end'. In a positive response to the six points set out recently by Mr Dick Spring, Irish foreign minister, Mr Molyneaux said that while some 'clarification' was needed, Dublin was 'moving in the right direction'. Asked whether he had an effective veto over proposals put forward by Mr John Major, the British prime minister, Mr Molyneaux said: 'If quite obviously they were going to suggest that they would transfer Northern Ireland lock stock and barrel within say three years to an Irish Republic, well nobody could expect us to live with that situation.' Under such circumstances, the UUP - on whose nine MPs Mr Major depends to swell his precarious majority - would 'terminate the lifetime of this parliament prematurely'.

This brings the resumption of all-party talks between the province's constitutional parties a step nearer. Mr Michael Ancram, the Northern Ireland minister, is understood to be close to completing the delicate task of identifying an outline that could form the basis for an eventual settlement. Resumed talks are expected to focus on the creation of an 85-seat legislative assembly - the model for which was drawn up in talks last year. Under a blueprint agreed by a working group including all four constitutional parties, an assembly with some legislative powers would be elected by proportional representation. In a separate move the government yesterday announced plans to prune the 29,000-strong Northern Ireland civil service with the help of a voluntary redundancy scheme. Ministers expect that civil servant numbers will have to fall by between 600 and 700 by March 1995, representing a 3 per cent cut in non-industrial staff.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Today the process is in effect on hold and the corridors of Westminster are thick with intrigue and recrimination. Whispering campaigns are under way against the leaders of the two largest political parties in the province. The speed and degree of the mood change must be disconcerting to those who confidently assert that the talks will move smoothly after a pause for the campaign for June's European elections and the 'marching season' which will follow in July. The odds are still that these optimists will be right. Some exchanges in yesterday's Saint Patrick's Day session of Northern Ireland questions in the Commons were positively playful, suggesting the situation could improve as rapidly as it has deteriorated. But the level of spleen vented, principally in private, between the main protagonists is already such that it may leave scars. Bridges burnt over the next three months in the interests of campaigning may not be as speedily repaired as some imagine. The whispering campaign against Mr James Molyneaux - some government loyalists are calling into question the Ulster Unionist party leader's tactics during the London-Dublin peace initiative - appears to stem from a cooling of his relations with Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary. This dates from London's decision last month to send Dublin a checklist of ideas covering relations in Ulster and between the province and the Irish government. Senior Ulster Unionists say this broke a pledge by ministers that they would be shown this document before anyone else. At the end of last month Mr Molyneaux showed his irritation by attacking Sir Patrick for 'to some extent torpedoing' the talks process. Senior Ulster Unionists say Mr Molyneaux subsequently declined to take a copy of the checklist offered to him by Sir Patrick at a private meeting, although other senior Ulster Unionists are now understood to be in possession of the document. London says Sir Patrick showed Mr Molyneaux the checklist, in common with the leaders of the other Northern Ireland parties engaged in bilateral discussions co-ordinated by Mr Michael Ancram, the Northern Ireland minister. The UUP has said it is willing to continue bilateral talks. Many observers argue that relations between the UUP and London were bound to cool given the party's anxiety to protect its flank against the hardline Democratic Unionist party ahead of the European elections. By this line of reasoning, UUP leaders were waiting for a pretext to force a rift. The UUP, for its part, has started to pursue its own whispering campaign - against Mr John Hume, the Social Democratic and Labour party leader - with renewed intensity. They say that he does not represent the views of his party in insisting that the 'nothing is agreed until everything is agreed' formula governing the talks must be adhered to come what may. Their aim is to isolate Mr Hume and bring about a situation in which an assembly, with safeguards to protect minority rights, could be set up in Northern Ireland, irrespective of whether agreement was possible on either north-south relations or relations between London and Dublin. A Lords debate on the province earlier this month showed that this view is not confined to Ulster Unionists. Lord Brookeborough, a Conservative peer, said: 'The SDLP looks not a little split with John Hume getting too close to Dublin and Sinn Fein for many of his party members' liking.' In the same debate Lord Fitt - who left the SDLP in 1979 and now calls himself an independent socialist - said the 'nothing is agreed . . . ' formula 'can only lead to the defeat of the whole operation'. Meanwhile, the DUP - sensing a chance to undermine the Downing Street declaration - has started to call for a united unionist front against the document. Mr Peter Robinson, the party's deputy leader, called earlier this week for all pro-union groups opposed to the joint declaration to form a co-ordinating unit to advance their case to government.

After talks in Dublin with Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, Mr Hurd said: 'We need a fair and widely acceptable political agreement . . . which has to cover all three strands of talks that are taking place.' Mr Hurd reinforced recent statements by Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, that there could be no 'internal settlement' in the province and any solution had to take into account the relations between the two governments, their relationships with Northern Ireland, and relationships between the Northern Ireland parties - hence the three 'strands'. The last such talks on Northern Ireland's future administration ended last November without any significant agreement. The Unionist parties - and the Democratic Unionist party in particular - have since laid down a precondition that the Irish government must drop its territorial claim to the province, written in its constitution, before any new talks can begin. Both Mr Hurd and Mr Spring reaffirmed, however, their determination to see the talks resumed. When asked about the controversial move last month by Mr John Hume, leader of the Social Democratic Labour party, to hold talks with Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein leader, at the latter's request, Mr Spring said: 'Our position is that which it has always been, that the government will not enter into talks with the men of violence.

Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, said he was 'satisfied that the UDA is actively and primarily engaged in the commission of criminal, terrorist acts and so merits proscription'. For those purposes it acted as the Ulster Freedom Fighters, he said. The ban, which came into effect at midnight, means it is an offence to be a UDA member, to solicit funds or membership for the organisation, or to participate in any acts of the organisation. The UDA is the fourth loyalist group to be proscribed - the UFF is already banned, along with the Ulster Volunteer Force and the Red Hand Commandos. The move was broadly welcomed in London and Dublin and by nationalists in Northern Ireland. It was strongly criticised by Unionists on the grounds that Sinn Fein, the IRA's political arm, was not also banned. Mr Ken Maginnis, Ulster Unionist MP for Fermanagh and South Tyrone, said he did not understand why Sinn Fein 'which is also an organisation deeply involved in sectarian killings of Protestants' was not proscribed. Mr Peter Robinson, deputy leader of the Democratic Unionist party, said the decision not to ban Sinn Fein showed that the UDA ban was a sop to the mainly Roman Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party. Mr Michael Mates, Northern Ireland security minister, said Sinn Fein's status was also kept under review. 'Sinn Fein is an organisation which does not condemn violence, which is thoroughly reprehensible and repugnant,' he said. 'If the criteria for banning an organisation under the emergency provisions were to apply to Sinn Fein then we would, in the course of a review, come to a different decision from what we have come to at the moment.' The UDA is thought to be responsible for the deaths of about a third of the more than 2,000 civilians killed in Northern Ireland in the past 23 years. It said yesterday that it would always be there to 'defend its community'. Six nationalist terrorist groups are proscribed - the IRA, the Irish National Liberation Army and four smaller groups.

British and Irish ministers will meet this week for the last conference meeting under the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement before the April 30 talks, arranged by Mr Peter Brooke, Northern Ireland secretary. Mr Collins said on BBC Radio in Belfast yesterday that the talks could well include Unionist leaders' deep-seated concern about Articles two and three of the republic's constitution, which lay claim to the north. The talks will cover a successor to the 1985 agreement and devolution. 'There is no restriction on anybody to raise any matter they want,' Mr Collins said, adding that he expected a 'vibrant and open' dialogue. His comments come amid hopeful signs of mutual goodwill among all parties involved in the talks, but optimism is tempered severely by an appreciation of the sectarian differences in Northern Ireland. Mr Collins said that if talks succeeded, 'the reason for the terrorists' existence will no longer be there'. Mr Brooke told businessmen in the US last week that he thought success was a 'possibility' rather than a probability. Northern Ireland's political parties have been busy preparing - mostly in secret - position papers for the talks which will see Unionist and nationalist leaders meeting for the first time in 15 years. Each side is expected soon to nominate a three-man negotiating team plus seven in support. Friday's meeting of the Anglo-Irish Conference has deliberately been kept short although the agenda includes recent allegations over leaks to IRA terrorists by the Irish police, the economy, tourism and transport issues, as well as the political talks. Conference meetings under the 1985 pact have been abhorred by Unionists because of the influence they are seen to give to the republic's government in the affairs of the province. The round-table discussions will start with bilateral talks between Mr Brooke and all the parties, followed by plenary sessions in Belfast on devolution. Friday's meeting is expected to consider the location of the subsequent strands of the talks, which include alternatives to the 1985 agreement. The aim is to cover 'the totality of relations' within Ireland and with the UK. No points will be agreed until a complete package is in place. The Northern Ireland Office is offering administrative back-up to the political parties involved - the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party, the Alliance party, the Democratic Unionist party and the Ulster Unionist party. Dr John Alderdice, leader of the Alliance party, said at the weekend that it was the 'last chance' for some of Northern Ireland's senior politicians to take part in what could be a historic settlement, a thinly veiled reference to Mr James Molyneaux and the Rev Ian Paisley, veteran leaders of the Ulster Unionist and Democratic Unionist parties respectively.

The meeting will be the first of its kind in Downing Street. It marks a recognition by the government that it cannot allow Northern Ireland policy to stagnate before the general election, even if local politicians fail to agree on starting round-table talks. Mr Major wants local politicians to take more of a leadership role in Northern Ireland following the government's failure to restart the talks on the province's political future. But he looks set to rebuff Unionist demands for the internment of terrorist suspects. Mr Major's initiative was reinforced by Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish Republic's premier-elect, who set Ulster as a priority issue. Speaking of the recent spate of killings, he said: 'We must not spare any effort and take every possible initiative to put a stop to it (the violence).' He said he looked forward to talks with Mr Major and broader cross-border relations when all options would be open for discussion. The Downing Street meeting, expected early next week, will be specifically on security issues. But Mr Peter Brooke, Northern Ireland secretary, portrayed it as part of a wider process of building a dialogue. Last month, when shelving his attempts to start formal political negotiations until after the election, Mr Brooke said local politicians would continue to meet to discuss matters of common concern. In a Commons statement yesterday, Mr Brooke was forced to defend the government's handling of security in the province following the outbreak of terrorist violence in which 26 people have been killed so far this year. In Belfast the recent killings have created a sense of shock and foreboding, even in a community which has become hardened to violence. The security situation 'is not and will not be allowed to get out of control', Mr Brooke said. But he met protests from Unionist MPs, anxious for the government to take tougher measures, who argued that 20 years of 'direct rule' meant responsibility for security lay with ministers. When one Tory MP warned that the province was 'quite close to sliding into civil war', Mr Brooke replied that it was essential for the government, like the local community, 'to keep its nerve'. He described the recent incidents - the latest of which saw five Catholics killed in a Belfast bookmakers - as 'part of a wider tragedy in which the whole community shares'. Internment remains on the statute book but Mr Brooke gave no indication that it was being considered. Northern Ireland Office officials said the circumstances of strife and a breakdown in law and order justifying such a drastic measure were 'a long, long way off'. During Commons questions, Mr Paisley told the prime minister that talking would not solve the security problem. Mr Major replied: 'I believe it would greatly assist the search for peace if the clearest possible lead was given by all politicians in this country and in Northern Ireland.'

0,FT934-1976 ,"FT934-1976 _AN-DLPC5ACMFT 931216   FT  16 DEC 93 / The Joint Statement on Ulster: 'The most urgent issue is to remove causes of conflict' - Aim to end cycle of violence - British have no strategic or economic interest in province / Self-determination affirmed   Full text of joint declaration 1. The taoiseach, Mr Albert Reynolds TD, and the prime minister, the Rt Hon John Major MP, acknowledge that the most urgent and important issue facing the people of Ireland, north and south, and the British and Irish governments, is to remove the causes of conflict, to overcome the legacy of history and to heal the divisions which have resulted, recognising that the absence of a lasting and satisfactory settlement of relationships between the peoples of both islands has contributed to continuing tragedy and suffering. They believe that the development of an agreed framework for peace, which has been discussed between them since early last year, and which is based on a number of key principles articulated by the two governments over the past 20 years, together with the adaptation of other widely accepted principles, provides the starting point of a peace process designed to culminate in a political settlement. 2. The taoiseach and the prime minister are convinced of the inestimable value, to both their peoples, and particularly for the next generation, of healing divisions in Ireland and of ending a conflict which has been so manifestly to the detriment of all. Both recognise that the ending of divisions can come about only through the agreement and co-operation of the people, north and south, representing both traditions in Ireland. They therefore make a solemn commitment to promote co-operation at all levels on the basis of the fundamental principles, undertakings, obligations under international agreements, to which they have jointly committed themselves, and the guarantees which each government has given and now reaffirms, including Northern Ireland's statutory constitutional guarantee. It is their aim to foster agreement and reconciliation, leading to a new political framework founded on consent and encompassing arrangements within Northern Ireland, for the whole island and between these islands. 3. They also consider that the development of Europe will, of itself, require new approaches to serve interests common to both parts of the island of Ireland, and to Ireland and the UK as partners in the European Union. 4. The prime minister, on behalf of the British government, reaffirms that they will uphold the democratic wish of a greater number of the people of Northern Ireland on the issue of whether they prefer to support the union or a sovereign united Ireland. On this basis, he reiterates, on behalf of the British government, that they have no selfish strategic or economic interest in Northern Ireland. Their primary interest is to see peace, stability and reconciliation established by agreement among all the people who inhabit the island, and they will work together with the Irish government to achieve such an agreement, which will embrace the totality of relationships. The role of the British government will be to encourage, facilitate and enable the achievement of such agreement over a period through a process of dialogue and co-operation based on full respect for the rights and identities of both traditions in Ireland. They accept that such agreement may, as of right, take the form of agreed structures for the island as a whole, including a united Ireland achieved by peaceful means on the following basis. The British government agree that it is for the people of the island of Ireland alone, by agreement between the two parts respectively, to exercise their right of self-determination on the basis of consent, freely and concurrently given, north and south, to bring about a united Ireland, if that is their wish. They reaffirm as a binding obligation that they will, for their part, introduce the necessary legislation to give effect to this, or equally to any measure of agreement on future relationships in Ireland which the people living in Ireland may themselves freely so determine without external impediment. They believe that the people of Britain would wish, in friendship to all sides, to enable the people of Ireland to reach agreement on how they may live together in harmony and in partnership, with respect for their diverse traditions, and with full recognition of the special links and the unique relationship which exists between the peoples of Britain and Ireland. 5. The taoiseach, on behalf of the Irish government, considers that the lessons of Irish history, and especially of Northern Ireland, show that stability and well-being will not be found under any political system which is refused allegiance or rejected on grounds of identity by a significant minority of those governed by it. For this reason, it would be wrong to attempt to impose a united Ireland, in the absence of the freely given consent of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland. He accepts, on behalf of the Irish government, that the democratic right of self-determination by the people of Ireland as a whole must be achieved and exercised with and subject to the agreement and consent of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland and must, consistent with justice and equity, respect the democratic dignity and the civil rights and religious liberties of both communities, including the right to: Free political thought; freedom and expression of religion; pursue democratically national and political aspirations; seek constitutional change by peaceful and legitimate means; live wherever one chooses without hindrance; equal opportunity in all social and economic activity, regardless of class, creed, sex or colour. These would be reflected in any future political and constitutional arrangements emerging from a new and more broadly based agreement. 6. The taoiseach however recognises the genuine difficulties and barriers to building relationships of trust either within or beyond Northern Ireland, from which both traditions suffer. He will work to create a new era of trust, in which suspicion of the motives or actions of others is removed on the part of either community. He considers that the future of the island depends on the nature of the relationship between the two main traditions that inhabit it. Every effort must be made to build a new sense of trust between those communities. In recognition of the fears of the unionist community and as a token of his willingness to make a personal contribution to the building up of that necessary trust, the taoiseach will examine with his colleagues any elements in the democratic life and organisation of the Irish state that can be represented to the Irish government in the course of political dialogue as a real and substantial threat to their way of life and ethos, or that can be represented as not being fully consistent with a modern democratic and pluralist society, and undertakes to examine any possible ways of removing such obstacles. Such an examination would of course have due regard to the desire to preserve those inherited values that are largely shared throughout the island or that belong to the cultural and historical roots of the people of this island in all their diversity. The taoiseach hopes that over time a meeting of hearts and minds will develop, which will bring all the people of Ireland together, and will work towards that objective, but he pledges in the meantime that, as a result of the efforts that will be made to build mutual confidence, no Northern unionist should ever have to fear in future that this ideal will be pursued either by threat or coercion. 7. Both governments accept that Irish unity would be achieved only by those who favour this outcome persuading those who do not, peacefully and without coercion or violence, and that, if in the future a majority of the people of Northern Ireland are so persuaded, both governments will support and give legislative effect to their wish. But, notwithstanding the solemn affirmation by both governments in the Anglo-Irish agreement that any change in the status of Northern Ireland would only come about with the consent of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland, the taoiseach also recognises the continuing uncertainties and misgivings which dominate so much of Northern unionist attitudes towards the rest of Ireland. He believes that we stand at a stage of our history when the genuine feelings of all traditions in the north must be recognised and acknowledged. He appeals to both traditions at this time to grasp the opportunity for a fresh start and a new beginning, which could hold such promise for all our lives and the generations to come. He asks the people of Northern Ireland to look on the people of the republic as friends, who share their grief and shame over all the suffering of the last quarter of a century, and who want to develop the best possible relationship with them, a relationship in which trust and new understanding can flourish and grow. The taoiseach also acknowledges the presence in the constitution of the republic of elements which are deeply resented by Northern unionists, but which at the same time reflect hopes and ideals which lie deep in the hearts of many Irish men and women north and south. But as we move towards a new era of understanding in which new relationships of trust may grow and bring peace to the island of Ireland, the taoiseach believes that the time has come to consider together how best the hopes and identities of all can be expressed in more balanced ways, which no longer engender division and the lack of trust to which he has referred. He confirms that, in the event of an overall settlement, the Irish government will, as part of a balanced constitutional accommodation, put forward and support proposals for change in the Irish constitution which would fully reflect the principle of consent in Northern Ireland. 8. The taoiseach recognises the need to engage in dialogue which would address with honesty and integrity the fears of all traditions. But that dialogue, both within the north and between the people and their representatives of both parts of Ireland, must be entered into with an acknowledgement that the future security and welfare of the people of the island will depend on an open, frank and balanced approach to all the problems which for too long have caused division. 9. The British and Irish governments will seek, along with the Northern Ireland constitutional parties through a process of political dialogue, to create institutions and structures which, while respecting the diversity of the people of Ireland, would enable them to work together in all areas of common interest. This will help over a period to build the trust necessary to end past divisions, leading to an agreed and peaceful future. Such structures would, of course, include institutional recognition of the special links that exist between the peoples of Britain and Ireland as part of the totality of relationships, while taking account of newly forged links with the rest of Europe. 10. The British and Irish governments reiterate that the achievement of peace must involve a permanent end to the use of, or support for, paramilitary violence. They confirm that, in these circumstances, democratically mandated parties which establish a commitment to exclusively peaceful methods and which have shown that they abide by the democratic process, are free to participate fully in democratic politics and to join in dialogue in due course between the governments and the political parties on the way ahead. 11. The Irish government would make their own arrangements within their jurisdiction to enable democratic parties to consult together and share in dialogue about the political future. The taoiseach's intention is that these arrangements could include the establishment, in consultation with other parties, of a Forum for Peace and Reconciliation to make recommendations on ways in which agreement and trust between both traditions in Ireland can be promoted and established. 12. The taoiseach and the prime minister are determined to build on the fervent wish of both their peoples to see old fears and animosities replaced by a climate of peace. They believe the framework they have set out offers the people of Ireland, north and south, whatever their tradition, the basis to agree that from now on their differences can be negotiated and resolved exclusively by peaceful political means. They appeal to all concerned to grasp the opportunity for a new departure. That step would compromise no position or principle, nor prejudice the future for either community. On the contrary, it would be an incomparable gain for all. It would break decisively the cycle of violence and the intolerable suffering it entails for the people of these islands, particularly for both communities in Northern Ireland. It would allow the process of economic and social co-operation on the island to realise its full potential for prosperity and mutual understanding. It would transform the prospect for building on the progress already made in the talks process, involving the two governments and the constitutional parties in Northern Ireland. The taoiseach and the prime minister believe that these arrangements offer an opportunity to lay the foundations for a more peaceful and harmonious future devoid of the violence and bitter divisions which have scarred the past generation. They commit themselves and their governments to continue to work together, unremittingly, towards that objective. December 15 1993.   Countries:-  IEZ  Ireland, EC.     GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

The retrenchment is a result of the electricity industry's shift away from large steam turbines to smaller, more efficient combined-cycle plants. GEC Alsthom's Larne factory, which employs 500, produces large steam turbines and was particularly vulnerable to the change in philosophy. Its closure is a big blow to the Northern Ireland economy, and was attacked by trade union leaders. The remaining job cuts involve 200 workers at Stafford, 175 at Rugby and 28 at Manchester. GEC Alsthom, which is jointly owned by the General Electric Company of the UK and Alcatel Alsthom of France, employs 23,000 in the UK, excluding yesterday's reductions. Mr Douglas Gadd, chairman of GEC Alsthom, said: 'After the privatisation of the generating companies contracts we had from the old CEGB were cancelled. We are also dependent on exports but a number of overseas contracts are taking longer to fix.' The closure at Larne comes just three years after the announcement of a Pounds 20m investment programme, supported by the Northern Ireland Industrial Development Board, to modernise its production facilities. Mr Richard Needham, Ulster economy minister, said the announcement was a serious setback. The government would work closely with the company to try to minimise the long-term effects. Mr Gavin Laird, general secretary of the Amalgamated Engineering Union, called on GEC Alsthom to reverse its decision to close the Larne factory.  The Financial Times   London Page 24  "
0,FT931-560 ,"FT931-560 _AN-DC3CGAAIFT 930330   FT  30 MAR 93 / Government wins backing on pits      By DAVID OWEN, MICHAEL SMITH and RALPH ATKINS   THE government comfortably headed off a threatened backbench rebellion over its coal white paper last night, leaving it free to implement proposals to reprieve 12 of the 31 threatened pits. The 319 votes to 297 victory - a government majority of 22 - removed any question mark over the political career of Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary. A Labour amendment calling for domestic coal production to be maintained at present volumes was earlier defeated by 320 votes to 295. In both cases, the government's majority was bolstered by the support or abstentions of the nine Ulster Unionist MPs who last week won at least Pounds 10m extra help from the Northern Ireland Office for industrial electricity users in the province. Four Conservatives - Mr Bill Cash (Stafford), Mr Richard Alexander (Newark), Mrs Elizabeth Peacock (Batley and Spen) and Mr Nicholas Winterton (Macclesfield) - voted against the government motion. Another 16 did not vote, of whom three - Mr Steven Day (Cheadle), Mr Patrick Cormack (Staffordshire South), and Mr Winston Churchill (Davyhulme) - were believed deliberately to have abstained. These figures compared with six votes against and five abstentions when MPs debated the government's original pit closure programme last October. In a sometimes stormy debate, Mr Heseltine used the promise of 'hundreds of millions of pounds' in subsidies to the coal industry to keep the backbench revolt below danger levels. There was 'a significant new market to go for', he told a sceptical Commons. 'We have made it clear that the best hope for British Coal is to take advantage of the opportunity we have provided.' But a series of interventions by possible rebels indicated that he had not completely calmed fears that the 12 reprieved pits might not survive for more than a year. These fears were played on by Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, in a spirited plea to Tory MPs to join Labour in voting down the white paper. Today was the day for Tories who had voiced displeasure at the original pit closure announcement last October to make good the promises they had made five months ago to Britain's mining communities, Mr Cook argued. The debate came as the coal and electricity industries completed signing contracts for the sale of 160m tonnes of coal over five years, leaving the way clear for talks on extra sales aimed at saving the 12 reprieved pits. British Coal yesterday joined Mr Heseltine in admitting it could not forecast how big the extra market would be above the core contract. 'The generators and rest of electricity industry will effectively decide the future for our pits,' the company said.

0,FT933-13687 ,"FT933-13687 _AN-DGRAKADMFT 930717   FT  17 JUL 93 / Through a glass, darkly: If nothing else, the case for plain-speaking over Northern Ireland is now overwhelming      By RALPH ATKINS   Today he remarked how a shower of rain Had stopped so cleanly across Golightly's lane It might have been a wall of glass That had toppled over. He stood there, for ages, To wonder which side, if any, he should be on.  - 'The Boundary Commission' Paul Muldoon THE REVEREND Ian Paisley, scourge of liberals, Catholics and Irish romanticism, who towers over Northern Ireland politics like the Mourne mountains weep over Carlingford loch, was not being helpful. As I tested, gingerly, his reaction to my plan for Irish unification, his words of foreboding were as sulphurous as any in Paisley's three decades as Free Presbyterian minister and hard-line Unionist leader. 'God knows what will happen. There could be assassinations everywhere. It could be like Yugoslavia.' The British sell-out is already under way, he rasped. The effect could be read in people's faces and in loyalist violence. 'I go to funerals and it used to be that people talked. If they go today, they just walk. It's deep, deep, bitter resentment and anger.' Sitting in the small study of his voluminous Belfast home, Paisley glanced at a photograph of loyalist folk-hero Edward Carson, whose militia trooped in 1912 against Home Rule. Next to it on the wall were the wooden training gun and bandoleer of Paisley's father. There was no doubt that he was prepared to raise the loyalist standard again. To have expected anything less would have been naive. Paisley's career has been built on bogeyman politics; the apostates and Papists could not now be let through the glass partition. But the need for a positive contribution to stir debate and counter the rhetoric of Paisley and his followers is overwhelming. Terrorism abounds, but among politicians there is only imagery, stubborn threats - and an overwhelming sense that for one side to give just a little would be to shatter hundreds of years of history like a glass window caught in a downtown explosion. The province's political landscape has hardly changed since the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement when Margaret Thatcher and Dr Garett Fitzgerald, the UK and Irish prime ministers, agreed that the south should have a token say in the north's affairs. Since then the governments have looked to local nationalist politicians and those who want to preserve the union with the UK to dismantle the defences they have themselves erected. Northern Ireland is the biggest problem facing two west European governments. Each year about 100 people die. Damage to property in the province and on the British mainland runs into billions of pounds. Yet the recent Opsahl report on Northern Ireland, by independent commissioners, said: 'The British government's insistence that it is an honest broker, and that the ingredients of a settlement must be worked out by the two communities, adds to the recipe for conflict.' Hence my trip to see Ian Paisley, to look for a way beyond the miasma. To say Irish unification is a bold proposal is an understatement. There are doomsters aplenty, arguing that the Unionist veto that led to partition in 1921 is as potent as any time since the Protestant settlers of the 1600s. But there is a robust logic to the case for unity that - if all ways forward are to be explored - justifies testing. Leap forward a few years. A Northern Ireland secretary sits in his panelled office overlooking Horseguards' Parade, Whitehall. He baulks as news arrives of the latest terrorist atrocity. Loyalist killings, supposedly in the name of King Charles III, are rampant. His own life has been threatened by Protestant Red Hand Commandoes. Bombings by the nationalist IRA on the mainland have not stopped. But the newly-formed Democratic Unionist Paisley Memorial Party and the larger, more moderate Ulster Unionist Party are encased in a glassy silence, refusing to talk to the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour Party. The secretary of state, who was at primary school when 'the troubles' erupted, sighs and begins to draft a House of Commons statement: 'Mr Speaker, His Majesty's government is concerned about uncertainty over Northern Ireland's future. The provisional IRA believes it can bomb the British out of the province; loyalist paramilitaries kill nationalists in retaliation. 'I emphasise that the government will never give in to terrorism, but we accept that the people of Northern Ireland have a right to know about their future. 'Over the 40 years since the 'troubles' erupted, many suggestions have been made for accommodating unionist and nationalist aspirations. Few have won support among more than a handful; none has endured. 'We believe there are only two practical choices. First, that Northern Ireland should remain part of the UK in perpetuity. We could massively escalate the security apparatus. Many Sinn Fein and IRA supporters could be interned. A system of local government, as in English counties, could be introduced. But the breaches of civil liberties would be indefensible, the alienation of nationalists would deepen, the 1985 agreement would have to be torn up and the geographical anomaly of a land divided along a border drawn up after the first world war explicitly to create a protestant majority would remain. 'The second option is a united Ireland (gasps). We intend to open negotiations with the Dublin government about creating a new Ireland with protection for religious freedom and a powerful devolved Ulster assembly. 'Northern Ireland citizens will keep rights to British passports and to live in the UK. We see the new Ireland as having a special link with the UK, particularly in a European context. We envisage the UK Treasury subsidy to Northern Ireland, worth Pounds 3bn in 1993, continuing for many years. An extra 10,000 troops are being sent tonight to the province to reinforce the police against loyalist paramilitaries. 'It is a big step but, just as we cannot bow to IRA terrorism, we cannot allow the threat of a loyalist terrorist revolution to dictate the agenda.' (Uproar, shouts of 'Never', Ian Paisley Junior MP and 12 other Unionist MPs plus two dozen Conservative MPs storm out of the chamber. 'Order, Order.') Could it happen? Could a deal be struck between London and Dublin? How violent would be the backlash of unionists? Would the people of Ulster ever agree? In Dublin, the aspiration to unite Ireland exists, but with the anger, disarray and killings it would cause among compatriots in the north so obvious, there is little appetite to turn dreams into realities. At the Department of Foreign Affairs, a warren-like house off St Stephen's Green, stacks of the 1984 New Ireland Forum Report fill a room. This is the text from which the policy of the Fianna Fail and Labour party coalition government is still drawn. Compiled by nationalists opposed to violence, it prefered a united Ireland, 'achieved by agreement and consent, embracing the whole island of Ireland and providing irrevocable guarantees for the protection and preservation of both the Unionist and nationalist identities.' So much is encouraging. But the words were carefully chosen. The emphasis at the foreign affairs department under Labour's Dick Spring is on 'agreement and consent'. He has angered the British government in the last week by floating ideas such as 'joint-soveignty' - but only as proposals that could be put to political leaders or voters in the province. It is striking talking to officials and politicians in Dublin how unification talk is regarded as blarney. I was left with a palpable sense of hypocrisy. 'There is no question,' one senior diplomat told me, 'of us imposing ourselves on the people of Northern Ireland.' There is horror at the prospect that Dublin might have to foot the bill for policing Northern Ireland and subsidising its welfare state. The British Treasury's Pounds 3bn annual subsidy is equivalent to a third of Ireland's total tax revenue. Already the Irish Republic spends three times as much on security per capita than the British. In the Dail there still hangs a copy of the 1916 proclamation of independence, asserting: 'We declare the right of the people of Ireland to the ownership of Ireland, and to the unfettered control of Irish destinies.' But on the opposition benches, Prionsias DeRossa, leader of the Democratic Left and former president of the Workers Party - which sprang out of the official IRA when it declared a ceasefire - is now prominent in the campaign for Ireland's constitutional claim on the north to be amended. He was interned in the late 1950s but renounces terrorism because: 'You don't win freedom by denying someone else their freedomcatastrophe.' Far more immediate are the problems of a 19 per cent unemployment rate. Middle class families who have moved from north to south Ireland complain about low child benefit, the cost of health care or education and of poorer roads. Northerners' suspicions, particularly of the continuing dominance of the Roman Catholic church, are reflected in inward reappraisal among the Dublin political establishment. 'Society in the republic is going through a process of rapid change,' says Ivan Yates, a protestant Fine Gael member of the Dail: 'Traditional values and beliefs and the influence of religion are all parts of this process of change.' Thus impetus for unification would have to come from Britain. Backing for unification by consent has come close: it is Labour party policy and, except after a particularly horrendous atrocity, Northern Ireland rarely rates as a political issue at Westminster. There is a sense of despair and - let us be frank - indifference as long as the number of casualties appears containable. Formal links between the Conservatives and the Ulster Unionist Party are all but broken. Under James Molyneaux, UUP leader, the party's MPs sit on the opposition benches. Statuesque friends of the union like Enoch Powell and Ian Gow have retired or been murdered by the IRA. Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, says Britain has no economic or strategic interest in Northern Ireland. He uses a careful formula: the province will remain part of the UK so long as a majority of its population want to stay. The Northern Ireland Office would object strongly, but it does not take much twisting of words to convert that into saying that Britain would back unity by consent. Andrew Hunter, Tory backbench Northern Ireland committee chairman, complains that the government's policy encourages the 'one more heavers' in the IRA. But indifference now is far from saying that unification could win support among Conservative MPs. Such a move would depend critically on whether a deal could be peacefully achieved. At this point the argument for unification by consent begins to fall apart. For it is apparent to any visitor to Northern Ireland that there could never be agreement on anything other than that Ulster's tragedy is deep indeed. It is wrong, for example, to suppose that Northern Ireland's Roman Catholics will soon outnumber the Protestants. Censuses have been misleading because until recently Catholics were urged by Sinn Fein not to answer the voluntary religion question. So the Catholic population is shown as jumping from 28 per cent to 38.4 per cent over the past decade. Smoothing out such aberrations, Professor Paul Compton,of Queens University, Belfast, reckons the Catholic population is growing by roughly 2 percentage points a decade. 'If you extrapolate that it still gives you between 40 and 50 years before you have a Catholic majority and it will probably be another 20 years before there is a Catholic majority in the voting population. Whether they will all want a united Ireland as well is another question.' But the defences against encroaching nationalism are already being raised. In a spartan office above a parade of shops in Lisburn, Ray Smallwood and David Adams puff nervously at cigarettes. They are chairman and secretary of the Ulster Democratic Party - ostensibly a fringe unionist party, committed to peaceful means, but regarded as voicing the thoughts of the outlawed Ulster Defence Association, a shadowy umbrella organisation for working class unionists and loyalist paramilitaries. 'The British people of Ulster know,' says Smallwood, 'that the 1985 Anglo-Irish dictat is about a process of unification by the back door.' UDP membership, he reckons, is more than 200. What would happen if unification moved closer? 'If my right to self determination was taken away. . . ' His voice trails. He pauses, then looks at me. 'All people have a right to self-determination.' That unspoken threat of the protestant population rising in revolt is prevalent across Northern Ireland, not just in the hearts of organised extremists. It worries the Royal Ulster Constabulary. The loyalist terror groups, the Ulster Freedom Fighters and the Ulster Volunteer Force, are not as numerous as the nationalist IRA but older leaders have been purged, replaced by more ruthless, younger commanders. The security forces believe members move in and out, making infiltration harder. So far they remain largely a reactive force, retaliating against the IRA. The UFF and UVF have access to guns and grenades but as yet have no bomb-making facilities. Arms come from east Europe, South Africa and via pockets of Orange loyalism in Scotland and north England. Financing is via large-scale racketeering and extortion. At a time of perceived crises, however, the number of paramilitaries could quickly rise to wreak havoc across the province. The mostly-Protestant RUC itself, and the Royal Irish Regiment, would be under pressure to avert revolt within their ranks. In the middle class belt that stretches eastwards along Belfast lough from Northern Ireland's capital, the stubborn resistance of the Ulsterman is obvious. Talking to locals about unification closes doors, not opens them. Two local businessmen I approached refused to talk, even about the massive scope for cross-border trade (only 5 per cent of the republic's exports are to the north). They were probably sensible - strong words could catch the ears of paramilitaries looking for economic targets. Go into people's homes, and talk of unification is treacherous. Suspicion of the Irish republic - regarded as a safe haven for nationalist paramilitaries  -is rampant. 'There is too much history, too many people have been killed. These things are not forgotten. I'd leave the country,' said one professional family man I met. At Bangor Rugby Club I met Ronnie Boston, former club president and a retired local businessman. The club is a member of the all-Ireland rugby league but limits are firmly drawn: 'There was no conscription here during the war,' he says, 'but 100,000 people volunteered so it would anger me if Britain did announce that it was going to let Northern Ireland go. Our ancestors laid down their lives for the British.' Such realities are not lost on leaders of the nationalist community. John Hume, veteran leader of the Social Democratic and Labour Party, told me that a 32-county Ireland 'can only evolve and it can only evolve based on diversity.' He does not talk about divided territory, only divided people. 'Ireland is already one piece of land.' The SDLP looks to the model of European union - even though the Unionist community is among the most Euro-sceptical in the UK. So the glass walls remain. The most poignant impression is of how the province is seen through prisms in London and Dublin. The republic acts as if pursuing unity but clearly could not accept unification without consent, and consent will not be forthcoming. The UK government wants a locally-acceptable settlement but seems blind to the uncertainty and fear its neutral position creates. At least Ian Paisley is unequivocal. A first step towards peace would be for both governments to be explicit about what they want. Is Dublin serious about unification? If not, why not say so? The air of dangerous confusion might clear. If both governments can agree on the province's constitutional future, a common strategy could be devised to tackle terrorism and economic deprivation. There would be some certainties. It would be far better than politicians in London and Dublin standing there wondering which side, if any, they should be on.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.     IEZ  Ireland, EC.

The talks will enter what the participants believe to be the most important stage of the three-strand talks process which started in April. Preliminary discussions took place yesterday to agree an agenda, establish ground rules and organise a manageable negotiating structure. The main talks will involve three days of meetings each week. They will be held initially at Stormont Castle in Belfast and will then move to Dublin, probably in the last week of this month. It will be the first time since the partition of Ireland in 1922 that Unionist political leaders have travelled on official business to Dublin. The talks are part of Strand Two of the three-strand process. The aim is an agreed formula for self-rule in Northern Ireland to replace the 1985 Anglo-Irish agreement. Strand One involved only political parties while Strand Two will include the Dublin government. Strand Three will involve discussions between the British and Irish governments. A month has been set aside for the current round of talks, which will be chaired by Sir Ninian Stephen, a former governor-general of Australia. Talks in July were seen as a preliminary phase, and the real negotiations are now expected to get under way. Signs of flexibility will be sought - for example, on whether the Irish government is prepared to relax or amend its constitutional claim to Northern Ireland, and on whether the unionist parties are prepared to concede a role for Dublin in an Ulster administration.

0,FT944-5775 ,"FT944-5775 _AN-ELBDWAABFT 941202   FT  02 DEC 94 / Sinn Fein talks to start next week: Offer to negotiate comes three months after IRA ceasefire      By DAVID OWEN, GEORGE GRAHAM and JIMMY BURNS   The government is to begin talks with Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, in five days' time on December 7. The move will start an important phase of the Northern Ireland peace process. The announcement - made in a letter to Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, from a senior Downing Street official - came three months to the day after the IRA's ceasefire. Decommissioning of paramilitary arsenals will be top of the agenda in the talks, which are intended to start bringing Sinn Fein into the political mainstream. The Sinn Fein team is to be led by Mr Martin McGuinness, a vice-president in the organisation. Mr Quentin Thomas, the Number Two civil servant in the Northern Ireland Office, will lead the government's team. The talks will be held in Belfast, probably at Stormont. Yesterday's announcement of an earlier-than-expected date for the talks came as the government appeared to bow to US pressure over whether Sinn Fein members would be invited to an important Belfast investment conference this month. Several US institutions and corporations had threatened to boycott the conference unless Sinn Fein was included. They included Mr Alan Hevesi, New York City controller, who earlier this year signalled a plan to channel institutional funds towards Ulster in the form of 'Irish peace bonds', and Mr William Flyn, chairman of Mutual America, one of the biggest American insurance companies, who has helped to co-ordinate private investor interest in Ulster. Congressional supporters of the Irish Republicans urged the US administration not to allow Mr Ron Brown, US Commerce Secretary, to attend the conference unless the British government invited Mr Adams. Yesterday the government said a handful of Sinn Fein councillors would after all be invited in their capacity as members of two local council committees. The decision is thought to have had an important bearing on the starting date of preliminary talks with Sinn Fein, in effect entailing that they had to get under way before the conference on December 13 and 14. Ulster Unionists and some senior Conservatives were under the impression until very recently that the talks would begin only just before Christmas. Reaction to yesterday's announcement was mixed. The Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the hardline Democratic Unionist party, said the decision to hold talks with the 'men of blood' was 'highly resented'. But the move was welcomed by Ms Marjorie Mowlam, shadow Northern Ireland secretary. Mr Adams also responded positively: 'The opportunity to realise a lasting peace which will benefit all of the people of Ireland has never been greater.' In Washington, President Bill Clinton welcomed the announcement, saying that a just and lasting settlement in Northern Ireland was 'finally within reach'. Separately, he announced the appointment of Senator George Mitchell, the retiring leader of the Democratic Senate majority, to be his special adviser on Ulster economic initiatives. The Commerce Department said Mr Brown definitely planned to attend the conference. Mr Mitchell will consider attending. The issue became entangled with negotiations over Mr Adams's visit to Washington next week. Although the British government has not sought to dissuade the US from granting Mr Adams another visa, it has argued successfully that he must still not be allowed to raise funds in the US.

0,FT944-144 ,"FT944-144 _AN-FAAACAA5FT 941231   FT  31 DEC 94 / North-south divide seen to narrow      By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor   Most UK regions prospered more than London and south-east England in 1993, narrowing the north-south divide, the Central Statistical Office said yesterday. In its first review of UK economic output and income by region in 1993, the CSO reported that gross domestic product per head grew strongest in Wales and the southwest while the north-west, Northern Ireland, and Yorkshire and Humberside also performed better than average. Because of slower growth, Greater London and the south-east saw their GDP per head fall relative to the UK average for the fourth successive year while the east Midlands also lost ground in the two years to 1993. Scotland and Northern Ireland maintained gains won in the previous two to three years mainly at the expense of the south-east. Greater London's share of GDP fell 0.2 percentage points between 1987 and in 1993 to 14.9 per cent while the share of the rest of the south-east fell more sharply to 20.6 per cent in 1993 from 21.1 per cent in 1990. But Greater London and the south-east remained by far the most prosperous UK regions. At Pounds 11,528 and Pounds 10,215 respectively, GDP per head in London and in the rest of the south-east was 24.7 per cent and 10.5 per cent higher than the UK average. The south-east including London contained about 30 per cent of the UK population in 1993 but accounted for more than 35 per cent of GDP. South-east GDP per head, at Pounds 10,728, was 16 per cent above the UK average of Pounds 9,248. By contrast, GDP per head in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland were all below the UK and English averages. While Scotland came close to the UK average with GDP per head of Pounds 9,104, Wales and Northern Ireland trailed with Pounds 7,831 and Pounds 7,574 respectively. Marked differences in industrial structures explained some of the variation. The east Midlands were hit by coalmine closures in 1993 while increased oil activity boosted Scottish output. Manufacturing output in Wales and Northern Ireland grew at rates well above the national average in the year while Northern Ireland also reported above-average growth rates in the distribution, hotels, catering and repair sectors.

0,FT922-1664 ,"FT922-1664 _AN-CFTADAESFT 920620   FT  20 JUN 92 / Portents give few clues to Irish talks      By RALPH ATKINS   SYMBOLISM rather than substance dominated the first negotiations yesterday between Northern Ireland Unionists and the Irish government since 1973 - or since partition in the 1920s, depending on definitions. This was not 'strand two' of the talks on Northern Ireland's future. It was about drawing up an agenda for the point when the Irish government will formally enter to talk about relations between north and south Ireland. Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, has still to announce when that will be. As befitted a meeting no side wanted to overpromote, delegations were of officials or MPs, not party leaders and ministers. Arrivals were in modest official saloons or black cabs. Confidentiality was kept. The Rev Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionist party was expected to be the most recalcitrant. He wants strand one - on devolution, and still supposedly taking place in Belfast - finished before strand two starts. But he sent his daughter Rhonda and Mr Nigel Dodds, a former lord mayor of Belfast - the grandest post in Ulster's local politics, even if its responsibilities stretch only to bins, bogs and burials. As for other portents, Dr Chris McGimpsey, of the Ulster Unionist party, wore a green tie. The nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party - the most keen on strand two and strand three (the final strand) - arrived 10 minutes late. 'Bomb scares all over the place,' said Mr Seamus Mallon, SDLP deputy leader. The independent chairman was Sir Ninian Stephen, former governor-general of Australia. He has had a rapid lesson in the nuances of Northern Ireland politics. Inside, the delegations sat around a rectangular ash table with green inlay. They talked, broke for lunch, then met again. Late in the afternoon, as a storm broke over Westminster, a statement was agreed. 'The parties completed consideration of a possible agenda for strand two,' it said. As with the thunder, it was not clear what was foreshadowed.  The Financial Times   London Page 6  "
0,FT922-10534 ,"FT922-10534 _AN-CD3BPAE1FT 920430   FT  30 APR 92 / Ulster leaders begin fresh round of talks      By RALPH ATKINS   NORTHERN IRELAND's political leaders began talks yesterday in a fresh attempt to test whether decades of distrust in the province can yet be overcome. The resumption of negotiations at Stormont, outside Belfast, marked a reaffirmation of UK ministers' belief - or perhaps hope - that by juggling conflicting aspirations of nationalist and unionist leaders, and of the UK and Irish governments, a political solution can be found. Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, acknowledged the scale of his task in a written statement - his sole public comment - talking of the province's political impasse being resolved 'step by step'. In fact the agenda, as in the original set of talks under former Northern Ireland secretary Mr Peter Brooke last summer, is far grander - exploring the 'totality of relationships' including those between the republic and Northern Ireland and those between London and Dublin. Yet no participant pretends it is a 'peace conference' to secure an early to end terrorist violence. Another Roman Catholic was shot dead in north Belfast yesterday by loyalist paramilitaries. The timetable is tight. Three months have been set aside before the next Anglo-Irish conference, which is the cut-off point because of the hostility of Mr James Molyneaux, Ulster Unionist party leader and the Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionist party, to talking while the conferences take place. Talks - also involving Mr John Hume's nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party and the cross-community Alliance party - are planned for only two or three days a week. Most critically, 'strand two' of the talks - when discussion turns from a devolved government to relations between Northern Ireland and the republic - is due to begin 'within weeks'. It is the point at which the Irish government enters negotiations and a test of Unionists' willingness to talk to Dublin. It could be the breaking point. The rift may not be irreconcilable but inter-government rows do not help keep suspecting local political leaders at the negotiating table. Nevertheless there is renewed optimism. Already the talks have almost exceeded the achievements of last year, when seven weeks of wrangling delayed the start of plenary sessions. The tensions and insecurities of politicians unused to negotiations have been lessened by familiarity. Sir Patrick will make less of a feature than his predecessor of diplomatic niceties. A business committee has been set up to stop plenary sessions stumbling amid procedural rows.  The Financial Times   London Page 9  "
0,FT921-13386 ,"FT921-13386 _AN-CAVBGAA6FT 920122   FT  22 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: PM scorns agreement call over N Ireland - Electoral Pacts      By RALPH ATKINS   MR John Major fuelled speculation yesterday that he was contemplating a deal with Ulster Unionist MPs in a hung parliament when he scorned calls for a pact among the main parties on not changing the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement. Labour and Liberal Democrats expressed fears that the prime minister was prepared to jeopardise progress the government had made towards a political settlement in the province. Mr Kevin McNamara, Labour's Northern Ireland spokesman, said the prime minister was 'undermining' the work of Mr Peter Brooke, Northern Ireland secretary, over the past two years. The prime minister was 'playing political football' with the lives of people in the province, he said. Nevertheless, Downing Street officials rejected such an interpretation of the prime minister's comments, while Tories and the Unionist party have denied that any discussions have taken place. The row came a day after Mr Brooke offered his resignation for singing on an Irish television show a few hours after an IRA bomb attack in Country Tyrone last Friday. The death yesterday of another man injured in the blast brought total fatalities to eight. Mr Gay Byrne, the show's host, expressed regret for the trouble he caused Mr Brooke. Mr Major was asked by Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, if he would support a 'a cross-party approach to Northern Ireland affairs during the election and unequivocally reject any partisan trading with the Anglo-Irish Agreement'. Liberal Democrats, many of whom believe a hung parliament the most likely outcome of the contest, want to force the other main parties to set out more clearly what post-election deals they might contemplate. Mr Major's reply did not mention the agreement and said only: 'This party stands four-square against terrorism and we have set out our policies clearly . . . on many occasions. I do not see any imminent change.' Replacing the 1985 agreement, which gives the Irish government a say in Northern Ireland, would be a central demand of Unionist MPs if they held the balance of power after a general election. Mr Major spent two hours late on Monday night discussing security in the province with members of the Democratic Unionist and Ulster Unionist parties. But the meeting appears to have been more about exchanging views and restoring confidence in Mr Brooke than in sounding out possible post-election demands.

0,FT944-4253 ,"FT944-4253 _AN-ELIDCAB7FT 941209   FT  09 DEC 94 / Talks with loyalists start next Thursday      By DAVID OWEN, JIMMY BURNS, STEWART DALBY and KEVIN BROWN   The government is to start talks with loyalist representatives next Thursday  -a year after the signing of the Downing Street declaration. The announcement by Mr John Major came on the eve of historic talks in Belfast between a government team led by Mr Quentin Thomas, number two in the Northern Ireland Office, and Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing. The government is keeping open the option of upgrading the talks to ministerial level at a later date. It is hoped the dialogue will pave the way for both Sinn Fein and loyalist representatives to join talks involving Northern Ireland's main constitutional parties. Yesterday's developments came amid mounting signs of a rapprochement between the government and the Rev Ian Paisley's hardline Democratic Unionist party. A meeting on Tuesday between Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, and a DUP delegation led by Mr Paisley is understood to have been viewed as helpful by both sides. Separately, Mr Ron Brown, US Commerce Secretary, yesterday spoke out in favour of the decision to invite some members of Sinn Fein to next week's Belfast investment conference which is to be hosted by Mr Major. Mr Brown, who is leading a US delegation to the conference, said he could not conceive of 'a scenario that would bring peace and tranquility to Northern Ireland that does not include Sinn Fein'. Sinn Fein has not yet said whether it will attend the conference. It is pushing for a more elevated representation in the form of Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president. Mr Brown, dismissing the notion that there had been a poor response from US business leaders, said there were no plans for the US to make a public-sector contribution to infrastructure projects in the province. Top of the government's agenda in talks with both Sinn Fein and loyalists will be the decommissioning of paramilitary arsenals, which is seen as the key to the two sides' participation in future political talks. The prospects of making progress on this issue may have been complicated by the power vacuum in Dublin, however. It is understood that before the political crisis IRA leaders indicated to the Irish government that they would be willing to identify some arms caches in the south in return for British concessions on troop levels and IRA prisoners.

Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, said last week  that Dublin was seeking cross-border institutional links in  return for dropping its constitutional claim to Northern Ireland.    Sir Patrick, writing in SUNDAY LIFE, based in Belfast, said  there would be no joint authority over Northern Ireland without  the consent of the Unionist community. ""The British Government  is not engaged in some kind of conspiracy with Dublin to  introduce joint authority whether as a first step to a united  Ireland or at all.""    He recalled Mr Reynolds's comments in telling an Oxford  Union  audience last month that any settlement required the agreement  of the Unionists.    Sir Patrick said: ""That is not the talk of a government  blind to the fears of the Unionist people who share this island  with other Irish people. These are honest and realistic  statements, which recognise that history has certainly shaped  traditional attitudes, but that those of tomorrow and beyond  must be dictated by realism. I firmly believe that a proper and  lasting peace will come. Despite the darkness of recent weeks,  I sense that the desire to see a permanent change for the better  grows daily.""    There were reports yesterday that Sir Patrick -- who also  criticised terrorists on both sides -- may move on from Northern  Ireland in the forthcoming cabinet reshuffle.    One name being touted as a replacement is Brian Mawhinney,  the Health Minister, an Ulsterman who had already had a stint as  a junior minister in Northern Ireland.    Sinn Fein officials were last night playing down reports  that  the IRA was poised to announce an end to violence.    They said a formal response to the Downing Street  declaration  was still a fortnight or so away. The indications are that the  most it will offer is an initial three-month ceasefire. THE  MAIL ON SUNDAY suggested Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, was  seeking the agreement of all 200 hardcore IRA men before  announcing acceptance of the declaration.    Republican attacks continued yesterday, although without  injury. A mortar was fired at a Royal Ulster Constabulary  station at Pomeroy, Co Tyrone, and a missile missed four army  vehicles in west Belfast.    A soldier from the Royal Irish [RIR] Regiment was remanded  in  civilian custody on Saturday, charged with the murder three  months ago of Francis Brown, aged 38, a Catholic father of four.    The Ulster Volunteer Force had claimed responsibility for  the  murder.    Mr Brown was killed when a booby-trapped breeze block next  to  his lorry exploded outside his home in Portadown, Co Armagh.    Neil Thomas Irwin, aged 24, a private based at Drumadd  Barracks, Armagh City, was also accused of four attempted  murders.    In one, a bomb was thrown through the window of the home of  the mother of a former Sinn Fein councillor.    Private Irwin was further accused of possessing explosives,  an improvised booby trap and an assault rifle, with intent to  endanger life.    Staff Sergeant Maurice James Nicholl, aged 37, also from the  RIR Drumadd Barracks, was charged with possessing an improvised  booby trap and an assault rifle with intent to endanger life.  Both denied the charges and were remanded in custody by Belfast  magistrates until July 15.     "

Following the recent IRA ceasefire, the conference overwhelmingly accepted a statement by Labour's national executive committee which stressed that there could be a united Ireland only with the consent of its people. The change in policy, which means that Labour will no longer persuade unionists to accept unification, follows a campaign by Mr Blair to move his party away from its traditional pro-nationalist stance. However, some nationalists in the party maintained last night that they had forced the Labour leadership to a compromise. They said a composite resolution also passed by the conference yesterday put pressure on the unionists to accept a constitutional settlement between north and south. The NEC statement marks a substantial move in favour of unionist opinion in the province by stating that 'there can be no change in the constitutional status of Northern Ireland without the consent of its people'. It adds that 'it is for the people of Ireland alone to exercise their right of self-determination'. Some party leaders had feared that Mr Blair's determination to change policy might trigger a row. But he has successfully convinced colleagues that Labour's campaign for a united Ireland was outdated and could have damaged prospects for permanent peace. Addressing the conference yesterday, Mr Kevin McNamara, shadow Northern Ireland spokesman, underlined the extent of Mr Blair's success in persuading colleagues to change course. Mr McNamara is regarded as one of Labour's strongest pro-nationalists. But he emphasised that a united Ireland was the best solution 'in the long run' - a phrase which implied to many delegates that it has gone on the policy back-burner. Nationalists claimed that the composite resolution passed by conference contained a greater commitment to unification than the NEC statement. In particular, the composite puts pressure on unionist politicians by arguing that 'the intransigence of any party, group or individual should not be permitted to veto discussions or any move along the path to peace'. However, there was reassurance for Ulster's Protestant community from Mr John Hume, the leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party, who addressed a packed session of the conference. Mr Hume, who was given a standing ovation, urged a 'dual referendum' in Ulster and the Irish Republic to give people a say on any outcome from cross-party talks.

His trip comes amid continuing anxiety in Whitehall about how US policy on Northern Ireland will develop under President Bill Clinton. Sir Patrick will concentrate on explaining Britain's 'neutral' role in the province but also its commitment to keeping the province as part of the UK so long as that is backed by a majority of its population. Visits to the US by Northern Ireland Office ministers in recent years have tended to concentrate more on promoting investment in the province. Sir Patrick hopes to re-start political talks after the local elections in the province on May 19, involving Unionists, nationalists, and the British and Irish governments. He is opposed to the sending of a US 'peace envoy' as mooted by President Clinton but would accept a delegation with a less specific role. Britain is concerned about the adoption of the so-called 'MacBride principles' for company investment polices by US state and city governments. The principles are meant to promote employment of Catholics but Britain argues that existing 'fair employment' laws are sufficiently tough. On his visits to New York, Washington and Boston Sir Patrick will meet members of the government, Senate, and churches as well as the media. As the government steps up efforts to bring the participants back to negotiations, Mr John Major, prime minister, yesterday met Mr James Molyneaux, leader of the Ulster Unionist party. Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, last night called on Unionist politicians to enter unconditional talks on the future of the province. He also made it clear that any proposed political solution for Ulster based on purely internal arrangements would not secure support in Dublin.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

0,FT923-1767 ,"FT923-1767 _AN-CIUDDAFIFT 920921   FT  21 SEP 92 / Survey of Northern Ireland (8): Breaking out of isolation - Transport and Telecoms      By JIM FLANAGAN   NORTHERN Ireland has moved transport and telecommunications rapidly up its economic agenda. There are pressing reasons for it to do so. As well as its peripheral position within Europe, the EC's commitment to creating new transport links between Europe and the Republic of Ireland - the only country not joined to the EC by road or rail - after the opening of the Channel Tunnel will have important effects on the province's ports, particularly Larne, Ireland's main roll-on, roll-off (ro-ro) harbour. About a quarter of Larne's freight traffic either comes from or is going to the Republic of Ireland. The short crossing to Scotland - from Larne and Cairnryan - is the favoured route of road hauliers heading for the rest of Britain and on to Europe. A General Consumer Council report, written last year by transport studies professor Austin Smyth from the University of Ulster, suggested that improvements to the region's transport system should be viewed in a Irish single market context. 'Pursuit of the local interest in either Northern Ireland or Eire will only reinforce our problems of relative accessibility,' Professor Smyth says. The report made a number of recommendations aimed at countering perpherality. Professor Smyth's suggestions include more direct air services from the province to continental destinations, the upgrading of the A75 from Stranraer to the M6 to improve travelling times to England and continued improvements to Ulster's ports allowing them to maintain their competitive edge. Another recommendation - the use of high-speed catamarans - has become a reality with the introduction of the 90-minute SeaCat Belfast to Stranraer service in June. Hoverspeed, the Seacat operator, says passenger numbers are ahead of schedule and claims Belfast traders have benefitted from an increase in Scottish visitors. Increased trade is one of the most important factors behind the drive to improve cross-border transport. In 1991, Belfast Port had a record trading year with a 6 per cent increase, bringing the total number of goods handled to 9.4m tonnes. About 50 per cent of the port's total throughput is now accounted for by ro-ro and lift-on, lift-off container traffic. The increase came as a result of the addition of a third ship on the Belfast to Heysham service, the decision by Railfreight Distribution to channel all its Irish container traffic through Belfast and the introduction of a new Belfast to Liverpool ro-ro service. European links have also been strengthened by the introduction of a new container service to Le Havre and the provision of large ships on the Rotterdam and Oslo routes. More than 55 per cent of Ulster's seaborne trade is now shipped through Belfast Port, which is undergoing a 10-year capital expenditure programme of over Pounds 100m, aided by EC grants. Measures, it would seem, are having some success. Last year, the Department of the Environment's digest of statistics summarising transport trends in the province found domestic freight on Ulster roads  - regarded as one of the least congested systems in the UK - had increased by 77 per cent between 1987 and 1990. The report also said transport at Northern Ireland Airports, which runs Belfast International Airport and which has invested heavily in the airport, had increased by 20 per cent - scheduled and chartered movements growing by 19 per cent and 25 per cent respectively. Between 1985 and 1990, Belfast City Airport had the highest growth rate in Britain in terms of terminal passengers. The Northern Ireland Centre in Europe - the province's gateway to the European Commission - has been lobbying hard for a Brussels-Belfast air link. Work in progress includes the building of Belfast's new cross-harbour road and rail bridges which will significantly reduce travelling times between the north and south of Ireland. The Commission has also been involved in a study into the costs of upgrading the main Belfast to Dublin rail line. The modernisation of the line, which should lead to faster journeys between the capital cities, will cost over Pounds 65m. Although Northern Ireland had one of its worst ever years for inward investment last year, the province received 130 first-time visits by companies interested in investing in Europe. One of the main attractions for such potential investors in Northern Ireland is the province's telecommunications network - one of the EC's most advanced. Over the past five years British Telecom has invested around Pounds 200m in the local telecommunications infrastructure. In addition to the computerisation of the province's telephone exchanges, the European Commission has invested Pounds 7.25m under its Special Telecoms Action for Regional Development (Star) programme, designed to help Objective One regions - those most in need - to improve communications links. The result has been the completion of a world-leading fibre-optic telecommunications infrastructure linking even the more remote areas of the province. The existence of such an advanced network has had an important effect on the local economy. With distance eliminated, work can be carried out far from its original source. This has led, for instance, to London directory inquiry calls being answered in Northern Ireland and Ulster civil servants working on social services claims from the Home Counties. This has meant the creation of jobs. Of the 430 jobs lobbied for by the Industrial Development Board last year, 350 were such 'back office' posts which did not require public financial assistance. Figures for 1990/91 are even more striking, with over 1,000 jobs created involving investment of Pounds 25m in buildings and equipment and Pounds 10m in wages. In July, Mercury Communications landed its telecommunications cable in Northern Ireland. Mercury has spent the past five months installing underground cables to make the final link-up from Northern Ireland to the rest of Britain. The cable has been laid via the Isle of Man where there is a repeater unit boosting the telecommunications' signals to or from the province. In spite of recent transport and telecommunications advances, local business people are aware of the difficulties posed by geographic isolation - they have had to live with the additional costs for years.

Mr John Major and Mr Albert Reynolds, the UK and Irish prime ministers, sought to give the talks their fullest support with a joint statement offering Unionists, in particular, the prize of a 'more broadly based agreement or structure, if this can be arrived at through direct discussion and negotiation'. They said 'an opportunity now exists for open, constructive and far-reaching dialogue both on the issues which divide the two main traditions in Ireland and on those which unite them. All of us share a common commitment to the values of constitutional politics and a total rejection of violence as a means of achieving political progress'. Neither man was present at the talks. The UK delegation was headed by Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, and the Irish team by Mr John Wilson, deputy prime minister. The talks, which will resume today, lasted three hours and were held amid tight security at Lancaster House under the independent chairmanship of Sir Ninian Stephen, former governor-general of Australia. They brought all shades of Unionist parties face to face with Irish ministers for the first time since partition in the 1920s. The Rev Ian Paisley and Mr James Molyneaux, the two Unionist leaders, are anxious for a replacement of the 1985 Agreement, which they believe gives too great a role to Dublin in the affairs of Northern Ireland. They also want an end to Ireland's constitutional claim on the north. The Irish and the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party put more emphasis on greater co-operation between Northern Ireland and the south. Dublin argues that if Ireland's constitution is up for negotiation, so too should the UK legislation which led to partition. Irish ministers say their country's constitution has to reflect a strong 'aspiration' to unification. The meeting formed the start of the second 'strand' of a talks process which began in April. Unionists only agreed to the transition following assurances from Sir Patrick that it would be on the basis of a sketchy agreement reached in 'strand one' on devolution in the province. Some Unionist MPs hope that Sir Patrick will legislate for a devolved assembly even if the talks collapse, in spite of an agreement by the participants that 'nothing will be agreed until everything is agreed'.

The announcement came as both the US and the European Union reaffirmed their commitment to support the Northern Ireland economy. In an address to the 300 business delegates at the Belfast conference, the prime minister argued that there were five reasons for investing in the province - the educated labour force; its competitive business costs; one of the most attractive incentive packages on offer in Europe; a strategic location as a bridgehead for US and Asian investors; and its technology infrastructure. Outlining plans for new investments totalling about Pounds 75m, Mr Major reiterated the government's commitment to fair employment. In apparent response to reservations voiced by some US executives about sectarian discrimination in the jobs market, the prime minister said the government was determined to 'correct this legacy'. He added: 'Everyone in Northern Ireland must have equal access to jobs and indeed to all the new opportunities of peace.' The prime minister devoted much of his speech to outlining the new community work programme, aimed at providing work for up to three years for people aged between 26 and 60 who have been out of work for more than a year. The objective was to break the 'vicious cycle of declining skills and motivation which long periods of unemployment can so easily create'. He said: 'Northern Ireland has a new beginning. I want people to see, with the minimum delay, the benefits peace is bringing - to commerce, to industry, to everyday life. 'Peace is giving rise to prosperity. Prosperity in turn will consolidate peace.' The need to underpin the ceasefire through economic measures was a theme echoed by Mr Ron Brown, US commerce secretary. 'At this decisive and hopeful moment, it is essential to create greater economic opportunity in a region whose prospects have been too long dimmed by bloodshed and enmity,' he said. Mr Brown said his presence at the conference was 'only part of a larger ongoing US commitment to Ireland'. The US, he said, was preparing a 'strategic plan' for the economies of both Northern Ireland and the border counties of the Republic. The plan would be presented at President Bill Clinton's investment conference in Philadelphia, scheduled for April, as part of a series of administration initiatives aimed at 'preserving the peace and engendering economic progress'. Mr Carlo Trojan, deputy secretary general at the European Commission, giving further details of the EU's Ecu300m (Pounds 236m) package announced last week, confirmed that the European Investment Bank would extend its interest rate subsidies to help investors in the province. Mr Trojan said the province would require 'significant and sustained investment over the coming years'. Mr Trojan also stressed the need to address structural problems. He said a challenge was 'the redirection of redundant skills especially in the security sector'.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P8331 Job Training and Related Services.

His visit to New York was a formidable coup for the man who has  long cultivated an image as the respectable face of IRA  terrorism. The often naive questions from the U.S. television  interviewers who feted the president of Sinn Fein during his  48-hour trip were a gift to such an accomplished propagandist.    So if the public reaction of the UK Government to President  Bill Clinton's decision to grant Mr Adams a visa has been  restrained, the private anger has been real. Efforts to end the  conflict in Northern Ireland do not sit easily alongside  appeasement of Irish-Americans in Boston and New York.    In any event Mr Adams's U.S. trip has done nothing to change  the realities of a conflict which has claimed more than 3,000  lives in 25 years. Even as he was appealing in New York for  ""peace,"" the IRA fired a 150-pound mortar bomb at British  troops. Nobody was killed. But it will not be long before the  bombs and bullets -- from loyalist as well as republican  paramilitaries -- add more names to the death roll.    Sitting in his elegant office in Belfast's Stormont Castle,  Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, was  concerned with these realities.    In an hour-long interview he insisted the Anglo-Irish  declaration signed in December by Mr John Major and Mr Albert  Reynolds, the British and Irish prime ministers, would in the  end provide the basis for durable peace.    Sir Patrick refused to speculate publicly on the odds of an  early end to the violence, but he gave the impression of a man  preparing for the long haul.    Intelligence reports on his desk almost certainly confirm  the  competing doves and hawks in the IRA have decided for the time  being to put internal unity ahead of peace.    Sir Patrick's message was that, whatever the IRA does in the  short term, the joint principles laid down in the declaration  are inviolable.    The two governments had spelt out that Ulster could not be  coerced into a united Ireland. Nor would Britain take on the  role of a ""persuader"" in seeking to break the province's links  with the rest of the UK. But it would not stand in the way of  Irish unity if that was ever the democratic wish of a majority  in the north.    As Sir Patrick put it: ""Each government has shown that it  understands and accepts the validity of the aspirations of each  side in the divided community...each government has agreed that  the future of Northern Ireland will be decided by the wishes of  the people living in Northern Ireland. And that is terribly  important.""    The republican charge that Britain is an imperialist power  was no longer sustainable. Northern Ireland is no Gaza Strip or  Cyprus, where people are denied access to the ballot box.    Despite Mr Clinton's decision this week, Sir Patrick is  convinced that agreement between London and Dublin on the  province's future will lead to progressive international  isolation of the IRA.    Meanwhile, the two governments would give impetus to efforts  to reinstate devolved administration in Northern Ireland and to  enhance co-operation between north and south.    Sir Patrick will table [present] within two weeks an outline  plan for a new political settlement. The plan -- to be  presented to the Ulster Unionist party, the mainly-Catholic  Social Democratic and Labour party [SDLP] and the non-sectarian  Alliance party -- will centre on a new devolved assembly in  Ulster.    It will also include proposals for a number of cross-border  executive boards with responsibility for such areas as tourism  and the environment. Reverend Ian Paisley's hardline Democratic  Unionist party [DUP] will be invited back to the table.    Together these proposals make up strands one and two of the  so-called three-stranded search for a comprehensive political  settlement. Strand three, as it is known, is concerned with  updating the 1985 Anglo-Irish agreement between the two  governments.    Sir Patrick cleared up once and for all the government's  position on Mr Adams's repeated demands for clarification,  negotiation (call it what you will), of the Downing Street text.  He will not get it.    Mr Adams wanted a place at the table before the IRA had  stopped its killing: ""It is entirely clear what he wants is a  renegotiation of the declaration.... And we are not going to do  it.""    There was ""a place and time for negotiation about the future  of Northern Ireland -- its status and everything else to do with  it. That place and time is during the talks from which nobody is  excluded except those who say: `We wish actually to fortify our  arguments with bombs.'""    Mr Adams knows it and, in Sir Patrick's judgment, is playing  for time.    Nor will a temporary truce do: The government will not  negotiate with Adams or anyone else unless and until they have  permanently ended violence or permanently ended the  justification for violence. ""I have made that clear time and  time again. So have the Irish. There is no daylight between us  on this.""    The reasoning is obvious: ""If you negotiate with people who  want a united Ireland...in those circumstances (of continuing  violence) it would undercut fatally other nationalist  politicians who accept the disciplines of constitutional  politics."" For other nationalist politicians you can substitute  Mr John Hume, the SDLP leader.    It is Mr Adams and his allies, not the British government,  who have it within their power to bring peace. ""The right  analogy seems to me to be this. Sinn Fein have the key. The  key is this: their ability to give up violence...if they put it  in the lock now and turn it, consequences follow which have been  spelt out."" But either way the declaration will remain on the  table: ""The lock is not going to be changed.""    Nor will the two governments allow Sinn Fein to paralyse the  search for a political settlement: ""The joint declaration is not  a substitute for the (political) talks process. It complements  it. But it is not a substitute for it.""    So after months of tortuous negotiations, Sir Patrick will  table what he calls a ""framework of ideas"" to secure agreement  among the province's constitutional parties on strand one and  strand two.    He is under no illusions that progress will be rapid: ""It's  a  delicate, slow, pragmatic process."" A previous attempt to secure  agreement broke down in acrimony in 1992. For the time being at  least the discussions will continue on a bilateral basis with  each party.    The moderate Ulster Unionists led by Mr James Molyneaux want  a devolved assembly but they are not interested in enhanced  co-operation with Dublin. The DUP, which walked out of the  talks to protest against the joint declaration, has yet to agree  even to join discussions.    Mr Molyneaux must be kept on side. Mr John Major's  government depends upon his support. So Sir Patrick is adamant  that there can be nothing in strand two (structures for  cross-border co-operation) which the unionists might condemn as  representing joint authority between London and Dublin over  affairs in the province.    But the constitutional nationalists represented by Mr Hume  are only interested in devolution if it is slotted into the  context of much closer co-operation between North and South.  They must be given something if they are to sign up to an  assembly. And so on -- the complexities and complications are  endless.    It will take months if not years to get within striking  distance of an agreement. The whole process could yet founder  on the prejudices and suspicions which scar the politics of  Northern Ireland. Holding the present alliance with Dublin will  not be easy if the IRA continues its campaign.    But in Sir Patrick's view there is no other route. For all  his success in New York, Mr Adams, identified as a dove in the  IRA power struggle which has followed the Downing Street  declaration, knows it.     "

0,FT943-6022 ,"FT943-6022 _AN-EIAD1ABNFT 940901   FT  01 SEP 94 / The IRA Ceasefire: Prize of peace in Ulster has never been closer      By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor   It may be too soon to celebrate. It is not too early for hope to displace the cynicism that has long suffocated politics in Northern Ireland. The prospects for a permanent peace remain uncertain. But the prize has never been closer since the present round of killings started 25 years ago. The grip of history has been loosened. Building a political settlement in a province where many are more frightened of peace than of war will not be easy. The misery inflicted on the people of Ulster by the mindless killings is matched only by the mutual mistrust across the sectarian divide. The habit of murder is deeply ingrained. Nor does it take much understanding of the past to appreciate that the objectives of the IRA and of the unionist majority are as irreconcilable today as they have ever been. After so many vicious murders over so many years, no one can be expected to take the IRA statement on trust. There was no mention of that most critical word - permanent. It may be that the present generation of republican leaders has given up hope of military victory. Certainly some in British intelligence share that view. History however - still an insidiously powerful force in Northern Ireland - reminds us that past ceasefires have split the republican movement. The killing has then resumed. The IRA remains as strong militarily as it has ever been. Some of its commanders will be looking for an opportunity to resume what they call the armed struggle. The response of the so-called loyalist paramilitaries - responsible in recent years for about half the killing in the province - will be crucial. The Rev Ian Paisley's warning of civil war was characteristically forthright. The hard-line Democratic Unionist leader is right, though, that the working-class Protestants need persuading that the price of peace has not been a weakening of Britain's commitment to the province. Mr John Major, the prime minister, and Mr Albert Reynolds, his Irish counterpart, have shown rare determination and grit in pushing the process this far. Mr Major, as beleaguered a prime minister as any in recent history, shrugged off the brickbats of colleagues who whispered behind their hands that last December's Downing Street declaration was destined to fail. He has gone as far as a Conservative leader could to rebuild trust with Ulster's nationalists and with the Dublin government. The personal risks have been considerable. So too have been his negotiating skills. Mr Major has managed thus far to avoid a backlash from the moderate majority among the unionists by ensuring that the door of 10 Downing Street has been ever open to Mr James Molyneaux, the leader of the Ulster Unionists. He has been rewarded by acquiescence, if not enthusiasm, from the leader of the province's most important political party. It will be harder now than it has ever been to sustain that careful political balancing act. But if the IRA statement does presage peace, Ireland could rescue Mr Major's premiership. Both prime ministers will have to take more risks. There will be many calling themselves Catholics or Protestants determined to wreck the initiative. There will be strains between London and Dublin. The contrasting tone of the responses in the two capitals underlines the danger. The understandable euphoria in Dublin was not echoed in Downing Street. Mr Major's statement spoke in more measured terms of the need to confirm that this is more than a pause in the killing. The risk is that an ambiguous ceasefire will create a rift between London and Dublin; that Mr Reynolds will be too eager to respond quickly to the IRA statement and that Mr Major will be unduly cautious. The political compromises behind the Downing Street declaration and the search for a new constitutional framework for Ulster would then be threatened. Some in Whitehall believe that has been the IRA's game-plan all along. So the two governments must stick firmly to their public pledge that there will be a place at the negotiating table for Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, only when it is clear the renunciation of violence is irrevocable. The fundamental principle on which co-operation between London and Dublin has been based is that of consent - in short, it is (and always will be) for the people of Northern Ireland to decide their own future. For all his government's protestations that nothing has changed in its attitude to the future of Ulster, Mr Major has moved in the direction of the nationalists. He has made explicit what has been implicit, but carefully hidden, in the approach of successive governments since 1973 - that Britain has no 'selfish or strategic' interest in maintaining Ulster as part of the union - it will do so only if and for as long as a majority in the province so wish. For his part Mr Reynolds has been obliged to admit the legitimacy of the unionist veto - that the nationalists' longstanding demand for self-determination in Ireland cannot override the wishes of a majority in Northern Ireland. That principle must remain inviolate. If Mr Major steps just an inch over the line dividing neutrality from persuasion he will lose the support of moderate unionists and face a backlash on his own back benches. In his understandable enthusiasm to ensure that the chance of peace is not lost, Mr Reynolds must be careful to ensure that reassurances to the unionists offered by London are not undercut by nationalist triumphalism in Dublin. Every step for the next few weeks will be an awkward one. There are ways in which the British government can respond quickly to the cessation of violence - by lifting the broadcasting ban on Sinn Fein, by changing the pattern of policing in Northern Ireland - which involve few risks. But it cannot allow the slightest hint that its actions are being driven by the threat of a resumption of IRA killing. Mr Major and Mr Reynolds must move quickly to finalise the outline plans for a political settlement they have been promising since early summer. The shape is clear - dilution of the republic's constitutional claim to Northern Ireland, changes in Britain's 1920 Government of Ireland Act to enshrine the principle of consent, a devolved Northern Ireland assembly and new cross-border institutions to build trust. It is talks on this document that Sinn Fein will be invited to join if in, say, two or three months' time the IRA has proved its good intent. You do not have to search too hard around Westminster to find those confident that even if the process gets that far, the nationalists' demand for a united Ireland and the determination of the Protestant majority to sustain the union will quickly restore the familiar deadlock. History is on the side of the cynics. But this time there is a decent chance the future will not be a prisoner of the past. The police said yesterday that 3,168 people had died in the sectarian terror which has engulfed Northern Ireland for 25 years. Maybe, just maybe, that is enough even for the IRA.

0,FT921-15952 ,"FT921-15952 _AN-CAGBXADZFT 920107   FT  07 JAN 92 / Dealing in the business of fear: How rival paramilitary groups raise and launder money through commerce and industry      By JIMMY BURNS   BEHIND the more visible measures to deter terrorism in Northern Ireland the government and the Royal Ulster Constabulary are fighting a secret war against the IRA's fund-raising efforts. Officials believe the IRA raises up to Pounds 6m a year, which finances arms and explosives, weekly payments to about 500 active 'volunteers', safe houses, travel, bribes and research and development on armaments. Protestant paramilitaries also fund operations from racketeering, generating income estimated by officials to be about Pounds 2m a year. But the IRA's financial activities and military organisation have been identified as far greater and more sophisticated than those of the Protestants and are the main focus of RUC activities. The IRA's bombing campaign against commercial targets and its assassinations of executives whose companies supply the armed forces have fuelled the climate of fear on which racketeering and extortion breed. The war against the paramilitary fund-raisers centres on two special units; one at an anonymous-looking building by the river in east Belfast, the other in the government offices at Stormont Castle. The first is the RUC's C13 anti-racketeering squad. The second is a little-known department made up of tax experts, accountants and an assortment of secretive intelligence gatherers from various sections of the Civil Service. Both units are considered by some officials as being as important as the detachments of police and soldiers that patrol the streets in the fight against terrorism. Mr Peter Brooke, Northern Ireland secretary, underlined the importance that the government attaches to its anti-racketeering strategy last year. He told the Commons that businessmen and accountants - 'persons of substance' - were becoming increasingly involved in raising and laundering funds used to finance terrorism. He also warned that, without action soon, there was a serious risk that those acting on behalf of terrorist organisations would succeed in establishing a commercial or business infrastructure capable of providing long-term support for terrorism. C13, set up in its present form in 1986, has recently had its status in the RUC upgraded. It has greatly increased its personnel and introduced state-of-the-art surveillance equipment and computerised intelligence databanks. Its officers are slick and - uncharacteristically for the RUC - worldly-wise. They have had contacts with the FBI in the US and with European police such as those in Italy, who have had experience of dealing with organised crime. The Civil Service unit at Stormont is a more recent creation. The Northern Ireland Office, for security reasons, carefully protects the identity of its members, some of whom are drawn from government departments not normally associated in the public eye with counter terrorism. Racketeering is one of the few issues that the Confederation of British Industry's regional office in Northern Ireland is not prepared to comment on. It argues that to go public would only fuel the IRA's campaign and produce more potential targets on both sides of the political divide. The main areas of the black 'micro-economy' in which officials claim paramilitaries have been operating include: Taxi services. Contributions are believed by officials to be made from companies operating in the republican and loyalist strongholds of Belfast. Non-invoiced drink sales. Money is thought to be channelled from sales in the social clubs which have taken the place of some of the Belfast pubs burnt down in the rioting of the 1970s. Tax fraud. This is thought to arise from the use of forged or illegally obtained tax exemption certificates by sub-contractors on building sites. Protection rackets. Business-people are forced to pay 'subscriptions' rather than risk having their operations disrupted by bombing or assassination of personnel. In addition, companies supplying the armed forces have been subjected to a campaign of intimidation often involving the killing of key personnel. New powers under the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Bill include those empowering the courts to seize the assets of anyone who benefited terrorist-related activities. Both the RUC and government officials claim they have begun to stem the tide of terrorist funding. They say that is the result of raids on organisations alleged to have been making significant contributions to the republican movement that had the potential to be diverted to the IRA. Not all the raids have been successful. Fourteen months after being raided by the security forces, offices of Sinn Fein (the political wing of the IRA), the Prisoners Welfare Committee, a charity called the Green Cross, and a Catholic taxi co-operative called West Belfast Taxi Insurance are operating within a short walk of each other off the Falls Road. Their fund-raising activities on behalf of the families of political prisoners remain unobstructed by the security forces as do those of the New York offices of Noraid, which channels funds from the Irish-American community. The only common link admitted to by all five organisations is that they are responsible for shouldering part of the costs of the republican movement. According to accounts registered with the US Department of Justice, Noraid has made deposits and payments through two US banks, Citibank and First Citizens. Green Cross says it has been a client for many years with Allied Irish Bank, while West Belfast Taxi Insurance says that it banks with Northern Bank. Noraid, Sinn Fein, the Prisoners Welfare Committee, the Green Cross and West Belfast Taxi Insurance all deny financing the IRA, although Noraid is registered with the US Department of Justice as a 'foreign agent representing the Irish Republican Army'. All four banks say they are not prepared to comment on accounts held by individuals or organisations. Documents seized so far have failed to provide evidence linking the fund-raising of the organisations and terrorist activity, although the RUC and the Stormont unit claimed to have found evidence of false accounting in the case of one Belfast taxi association and several social clubs. The RUC says several hundred thousand pounds have gone missing from the West Belfast Taxi Association. The accusation of false accounting, however, is denied by Mr Jim Neeson, the organisation's chairman. He said the 650 taxi drivers who belonged to his organisation paid an average of Pounds 2 a week each to the Green Cross, which he described as a 'charitable organisation' channelling funds to the families of political prisoners. The security forces, in their search for what may be much larger sums of money, are understood to be up against a complex system of money laundering by the IRA. According to government officials this is thought sometimes to involve front companies and the accounts of sympathisers or nominees who are not easily identifiable. They possibly extend to numerous banking jurisdictions both onshore and offshore, although the RUC and Stormont admit they may still have some way to go before coming to grips with the IRA's complex financial structure. While the identity of some individuals close to the IRA's finance 'command'  -responsible for supervising the collection and distribution of funds within the organisation - may be known to intelligence, there is as yet no hard evidence to ensure their conviction. One security official said: 'There is a disparity between what we know to be the case and what we can do because of lack of evidence.' Mr Alasdair Maclaughlin, of the Northern Ireland Bankers' Association, says he had no information as to how many local banks had shared the experience of the Bank of Ireland, which was presented with an extortion demand by the IRA for Pounds 2m last year - a demand it rejected. But he confirmed the practical difficulties faced by the authorities as they attempt to track more subtle forms of terrorist-based financial transactions involving the use of nominee directors for front companies and money laundering. 'It's bound to be difficult when you have the criminal fraternity remarkably well qualified. They have brains which are trying to be ahead of the game . . . there are ways of getting into the system and laundering money.' Few companies will talk openly about the costs of protection rackets or their motives for not supplying the armed forces. The real costs of resisting terrorism is only slightly clearer. Economists believe the government compensation fund (see chart) understates the costs of terrorist activity against commercial activities. Short Brothers, the defence manufacturer and Northern Ireland's biggest private employer, has been the victim of seven IRA bomb attacks in the last two years. but it says it has never paid protection money, and its investment programme has not been affected. Smaller companies, however, cannot afford to pay the Pounds 10m Shorts says it has spent on security in the last two years. They have therefore been more vulnerable to extortion and threats against personnel. In September one of Northern Ireland's leading timber companies, McCue Dick, announced it would no longer supply goods to the security forces after Mr John Haldane, its managing director, was shot dead by the IRA. The issue of payments to terrorist organisations and the operation of contracts with the security forces is regarded as virtually taboo by the majority of the business community. The Northern Ireland Building Federation refuses to discuss the issue in public. But one senior member of the Federation said extortion had been on the increase since the beginning of 1991. 'The difficulty comes when a contractor is two thirds of the way through his project and has made a financial commitment . . . but the practical reality is that it is impossible to have a 24-hour police guard and there is no choice but to abandon it.' The construction company Mivan is among the few businesses to have talked about its difficulties, after testifying against paramilitaries that extorted money from it. Although Mivan faced racketeers that belonged to Protestant paramilitary organisations, the case illustrates the problems of construction companies which feel threatened by the IRA. The company had started work on a building site in Belfast when one of its managers was approached by men claiming to be raising funds on behalf of a prisoners' welfare fund. In the following weeks the pressure intensified with warnings that, unless the company agreed to pay cash directly to collectors, plant and machinery would be damaged and members of staff attacked. Mivan agreed to be party to a sting operation involving C13 and subsequently testified in a court case against the men involved. Last year it was again approached for money when it began work on a Pounds 500,000 renovation programme in the low-income Shankill area of Belfast. It decided to abandon the contract. Money paid by the Northern Ireland Office in compensation to companies which have been victims of terrorism reached a record last year and forced the government to freeze its public-spending budget. The government argues compensation is necessary if future investment is not to be deterred, but it has not succeeded in eradicating the fear felt by wide sectors of the business community. Fear underlined the words of a Belfast businessmen who told a local journalist soon after Mr Brooke's appeal in October: 'If businessmen have any sense they'll keep their mouths shut . . . even if we do own up, the police won't catch the big boys. I'm paying Pounds 600 every six months to the Provos and Pounds 600 to the Prods, so I'm getting off pretty light. 'The way it works is that you get a phone call saying a collection's going to be taken in a couple of days for political prisoners and to have the money ready. But if you phone the police and they lift the man who calls for the money, that's only the messenger. When he doesn't get back the godfather knows what's happening and I'm dead.' Police are urging businesses to use their 'helpline' to tip them off about extortion attempts and to testify in court. But a leading builder, who insisted on anonymity, commented: 'Most people are unwilling to go to court unless they feel the weight of evidence is such that the police can get a conviction and are quite certain that neither (they) nor their families would be put at risk.' He added: 'The reality is that the IRA have the potential to kill and the security forces are unable to protect us.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- THE FINANCES OF TERRORISM  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Estimated running operational costs (per annum):   Includes average payment of Pounds 40 per week to some 500 'active'   volunteers; safe houses; arms; military research and development;   travel; bribes: Pounds 6m; Protestant paramilitaries: Pounds 2m  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Major sources of alleged IRA income (per annum):   Taxis: Pounds 600,000   Drinking Clubs: Pounds 750,000   Protection and Extortion: Pounds 1.3m   Tax Fraud: Pounds 1m  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Other sources of Republican funds:   Contributions of 10 drinking clubs to Green Cross: Pounds 100,000   Declared contributions of West Belfast taxi drivers to Green   Cross: Pounds 28,800 (approx)   Declared income of Green Cross: Pounds 384,000 (approx)   Declared income of Republican Prisoners Welfare Committee: Pounds   20,000  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- NORAID:   Aug 1987-Jan 1988 Income:    Contributions: Dollars 110,223    Merchandise sold: Dollars 55,764    Expenses: Dollars 180,077    Money sent to An Cumann Cabhrach: Dollars 62,425   August 1988-January 1989: Money sent to An Cumann Cabrach: Dollars   73,000  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- COSTS OF TERRORISM:   Government's business compensation budget:    1990/1: Pounds 22.5m    1991/2: Pounds 33.5m  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TWO-YEAR TOTAL: Pounds 56m  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- (Sources: UK government departments; report by David Davis MP; US Department of Justice; Green Cross; West Belfast Taxi Insurance; Republican Prisoners Welfare Committee)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  The Financial Times   London Page 10 Photograph (Omitted).

0,FT943-3207 ,"FT943-3207 _AN-EIOC7AC6FT 940915   FT  15 SEP 94 / Survey of Northern Ireland (1): The challenge now is winning the peace - With the prospect of a lasting peace now firmly on the agenda, serious thoughts are being given to the economic implications      By TIM COONE   Sir John Davies, the attorney general for Ireland under the first Queen Elizabeth, described Ulster in 1606 as 'the most rude and unreformed part of Ireland, and the seat and nest of the last great rebellion.' Catholic Irish lords had constantly 'champed at the bit' of British rule, but it was 315 years after the attorney general wrote those words before the problem of seemingly perpetual Irish revolt was partially resolved by partitioning the island in 1921. A better-known former UK attorney general, and currently the Northern Ireland secretary of state, Sir Patrick Mayhew, has had the delicate task of presiding over the ending of another rebellion, that of the Provisional IRA, which for the past 25 years has created havoc in Ulster and on the British mainland in its efforts to force a total British withdrawal from the province. The IRA's cessation of hostilities, announced two weeks ago, has so far held, and a growing number of political leaders both domestically and abroad are coming to believe that this may really be the permanent cessation of violence demanded by the two governments in last December's Downing Street declaration, and which will pave the way for the inclusion of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, into round-table talks. Sir Patrick stresses that it is the 'intention' that the ceasefire be permanent which is important and that this must be matched by deeds and words before the British government can finally accept the IRA's bona fides  -'the reason is that this government cannot be seen to sit and down and talk to people who may be reserving an option of going back to their former violence if they don't get what they want at the table . . . I have to maintain the confidence of people in Northern Ireland.' That confidence is showing signs of growing. In Dublin, the Irish prime minister met Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president last week, to prepare the ground for Sinn Fein's inclusion in a Dublin-based Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, which will bring together the political parties in the Republic with Sinn Fein, the nationalist Social Democratic Labour Party (SDLP) and the moderate Alliance party from Northern Ireland. The North's other unionist parties have so far refused to join the Forum, but some leaders of the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) have indicated that they believe the ceasefire to be permanent and, once convinced of that, have said that they will eventually sit at the table with Sinn Fein. At the international level, the US government has thrown its weight behind the peace process and held out a promise of economic assistance to Northern Ireland, as has the European Commission. Whether the Loyalist paramilitaries will also lay down their weapons - a key factor in the peace equation - remains to be resolved, and a small bomb planted at a Dublin railway station last Monday does not look encouraging. But community workers in Protestant working class areas of Belfast are convinced that a Loyalist ceasefire will be declared within the next few weeks. If so, the momentum towards peace would become increasingly unstoppable. The next hurdle in the peace process, once a ceasefire is established on both sides of the community, will be to convince all the political parties to sit down and negotiate new constitutional arrangements for Northern Ireland. A focus for these talks is being drafted by the British and Irish governments in the form of a 'framework document,' which will address such issues as reform of the Republic's territorial claim to Northern Ireland; a new elected assembly for the province; and cross-border administrative structures which will encourage greater economic and political co-operation between the Republic and Northern Ireland. No-one is under the illusion that these talks will be anything other than difficult. The UUP and the hard-line Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) see in the cross-border structures a potential trap which will lead to eventual joint sovereignty, and a back-door approach to a united Ireland. Mr Jim Gibney, who sits on the national executive of Sinn Fein, said his party would welcome new cross-party structures - 'if they are free-standing and can freely develop and there is no ceiling built into their development, we would see them as a process towards national reconciliation.' Unionist fears can, it is hoped, be dealt with, by having the executive powers of the new bodies jointly delegated to them by parliaments in both the Republic and Northern Ireland, rather than by the two governments, according to Sir Patrick. Whether nationalists will accept this, remains to be seen. Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, said last week that the next battle to come 'will be over the framework document.' But both governments are convinced that with a willingness to compromise by both nationalists and unionists, facilitated by a climate of peace, then agreement is achievable. Sir Patrick says 'there has got to be an outcome in which nobody can seek to have achieved everything at the end.' So, with the prospect of a lasting peace now firmly on the agenda, if not yet firmly in place, serious thoughts are now being given to the economic implications of peace. Economists are divided on the issue. There are those who say that Northern Ireland's development agencies such as the Industrial Development Board and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board, will be able to aggressively market the province to foreign investors, no longer having to fight against the negative image created by the troubles. The announcement last week by Hilton International, that it is to build a 187-bedroom hotel as a centrepiece to the new Laganside development in Belfast will be an encouragement to others thinking of capitalising on what is expected to be a tourist boom in the province in the years ahead. Seagate, the US electronics manufacturer, last year established a high-tech manufacturing facility in Londonderry, without waiting for a peace settlement, attracted by the large pool of skilled labour in the province. The textile industry continues to grow and now provides around a quarter of all manufacturing employment. First-class infrastructure in road, rail, telecoms, ports and airports adds to the attraction of the province. The optimists therefore say that peace will bring foreign investment on a similar scale to that achieved by Scotland, Wales and the Irish Republic. Whilst the economic benefit of peace is not in dispute, more cautious analysts point to the downside. As many as 20,000 people are estimated to be employed in the security forces and related occupations such as the security guards seen at the entrance of almost every large store and office block across the province. Many of these could be expected to lose their jobs. The short-term effect could be a rise in the unemployment level of 98,000 or 13.1 per cent of the workforce, already the highest in the UK. Sir Patrick acknowledges the problem - 'there is going to be a need for gradual adjustments and it is true that a lot of jobs are linked to the emergency.' He says that up to 80 per cent of the annual Pounds 1bn government spending on security is related to the emergency. The potential loss to the economy in security-related spending by both the public and private sectors could therefore exceed Pounds 1bn in the event of a lasting peace, equivalent to around 10 per cent of the province's GDP. Business leaders can thus be expected to exert intense pressure upon both governments to provide extra resources for Northern Ireland, whether from their own exchequers, or by enlisting support from Washington and Brussels. As Michael Smyth, an economist at the University of Ulster, says: 'The danger is that the government could pull the rug out from under the private sector, just as they have a chance of taking off.' After decades, indeed centuries, of conflict and rebellion in Northern Ireland, the real challenge thus facing Ulster's politicians as the 21st century approaches is no longer that of winning the war, but rather winning the peace.

Sir Patrick, who spoke with state department officials in Washington and was expected to see Mr Tom Foley, the speaker of the House of Representatives, and Senator Edward Kennedy, is also understood to have reiterated UK opposition to the sending of a US 'peace envoy' mooted by President Clinton. The British government has, however, made it clear that it would accept a delegation with a less specific role. The government is also concerned about the adoption of the so-called 'MacBride principles' for company investment policies by US state and city governments. The principles are meant to promote employment of Roman Catholics but the government argues that existing 'fair employment' laws are sufficiently tough. Speaking earlier in New York, Sir Patrick said that Noraid, the US fundraising group that wants a united Ireland, was a declining force unable to collect money for the IRA. Although the IRA claimed to be freedom fighters, Sir Patrick said that all they were fighting for was 'freedom from the common obligations of humanity'. One of President Clinton's top advisers Mr Ray Flynn, the US ambassador-designate to the Vatican, said yesterday that Mr Clinton was as committed now to helping break the political logjam as he was during the presidential campaign. In Londonderry Mr Flynn, the Mayor of Boston, said: 'I do feel the president is very committed to playing a constructive, positive and meaningful role in helping to end the violence in Northern Ireland.' Mr Flynn, who is on a three-day fact-finding visit to Ireland, said he supported the talks between Mr John Hume, the SDLP leader, and Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein leader, and believed Sinn Fein should be involved in any talks process.

0,FT944-15756 ,"FT944-15756 _AN-EJQD5ADMFT 941017   FT  17 OCT 94 / Leading Article: Ulster's missing centre   John Major's political skills probably do not extend to stage-managing the internal politics of the loyalist paramilitaries in Northern Ireland. The timing of their ceasefire announcement last week, on the eve of his speech to the Conservative party conference, was therefore either a stroke of luck for the prime minister or, possibly, a deliberate present to him from the loyalist leadership. The loyalists, like the mainstream Ulster Unionists but so far unlike the Rev Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionists, have apparently decided that 'the union is safe' in Mr Major's hands. They believe the IRA's cessation of violence since August 31 (except as a brutal method of policing its own urban strongholds) is an admission of defeat. They do not believe, as Mr Paisley does and as Sinn Fein claims to, that the IRA ceased fire only because Britain has lost interest in Northern Ireland and is looking for a way out. Mr Major's promise of a referendum on any new arrangement has reassured them, as it has unionist opinion generally. That pledge gives the majority in the province a veto which was not granted to it when Mr Major's predecessor negotiated the 1985 Anglo-Irish agreement. Opposite expectations So Northern Ireland begins this week free from the immediate fear of terrorism, for the first time in 25 years. That is a blessed relief, for which Mr Major certainly deserves his share of credit, along with his Irish opposite number, Albert Reynolds, and the leader of the main nationalist party in Northern Ireland, John Hume. But to call this ceasefire 'peace' would be premature because it is based on opposite expectations. Loyalists believe the United Kingdom is safe; republicans that they are on the way to a united Ireland. At least one of those expectations is going to be disappointed; the British and Irish governments may even, as they try to square the circle, convince both sides that they have been betrayed. That is the fear. The hope must be that peace will find its own momentum; that on neither side will paramilitary leaders wish to incur the odium of breaking it. That depends in part on those leaders themselves gaining psychological benefits from being seen as 'men of peace' rather than 'men of violence'. The effort to include them in negotiations is therefore justified. But no one should lose sight of the fact that in electoral terms these are fringe parties. They may have the ability to wreck a settlement. They do not have a mandate to negotiate one. Crucial breakthrough Much has been made of the parallels between the 'peace process' in Northern Ireland and those in South Africa and the Middle East. In so far as such parallels have any value, they suggest that the crucial breakthrough must be achieved by establishing a new relationship of trust and mutual understanding between the leaders of mainstream, representative parties in two hitherto bitterly polarised communities. That was achieved in South Africa between F W de Klerk and Nelson Mandela: the relationship reached a point where their respective communities' confidence in them depended on their ability to continue co-operating with each other and to demonstrate progress, and both understood that. Between Yassir Arafat and Yitzhak Rabin the same is objectively true, but the process is in difficulties because neither seems to be confident that the other has understood it. Between John Hume and James Molyneaux, who would be the analogous figures in Northern Ireland, the process has not really started. The job of creating such a relationship has been left to the British and Irish prime ministers. The latter certainly need to be involved, because nationalists in Northern Ireland would not have confidence in a purely internal settlement. But in the last resort trust has to be built between the two communities, and the leaders of the mainstream, representative political parties on both sides have a crucial part to play. Up to now Mr Hume has devoted his main energies to building an alliance of nationalist parties committed to constitutional methods; and Mr Molyneaux has been mainly concerned to keep the British government committed to maintaining the union. Both have succeeded, and deserve credit for their success. Now they need to concentrate on finding common ground with each other.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.     IEZ  Ireland, EC.

0,FT934-7642 ,"FT934-7642 _AN-DKSDHAAJFT 931119   FT  19 NOV 93 / Major prepares blueprint for Ulster peace      By PHILIP STEPHENS and DAVID OWEN   MR JOHN MAJOR reinforced his personal commitment to a political settlement in Northern Ireland yesterday by pledging to table a comprehensive plan if the momentum towards peace founders. The prime minister's statement to MPs at the start of the new session of parliament marked the second time in a week he had chosen a high-profile occasion to put his political authority behind the peace process. He repeated his readiness to offer Sinn Fein a place at the negotiating table if it permanently renounced violence. Senior Whitehall officials said the government was drafting proposals covering all three central elements in the search for a political settlement. Any blueprint would include plans for a devolved assembly in Ulster, enhanced co-operation between the province and the Republic and a new agreement to replace the Anglo-Irish intergovernmental conference. The statement overshadowed the announcement in the Queen's Speech of a programme of legislation designed to give substance to the 'back to basics' theme driving the government's domestic policy agenda. As expected, the 13 measures announced for the new parliamentary session will be dominated by an omnibus criminal justice bill, marking a much tougher stance on law and order; a legislative drive against regulation; and an overhaul of the organisation of teacher training. But Mr Major took a conscious decision to keep Northern Ireland at the top of the political agenda by modifying the government's position on the circumstances in which it would put forward its own plan. He indicated that he was no longer prepared to make a return to the negotiating table by all four constitutional parties in Ulster a precondition for a government blueprint. In an explicit warning to the Rev Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionist party, Mr Major added that 'no party or organisation' could exercise a veto on the process. Speaking as tens of thousands of people rallied in Northern Ireland to demand an end to the terrorist violence, he said he wanted a permanent end to violence and a political settle-ment. He emphasised that the precondition for a place in the process for Sinn Fein was that 'the violence must stop - and be seen to stop'. He added that the guarantee for the present constitutional status of Northern Ireland was 'cast-iron' as long as it represented the majority's wish. Signs of unease on the Conservative back benches that Mr Major may have leant too far in the direction of Sinn Fein were voiced by Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor. He questioned the point of contacts with an organisation committed to undermining Ulster's status. Mr James Molyneaux, leader of the Ulster Unionist party, responded positively to Mr Major's remarks, saying he could see 'no cause for alarm' in what the prime minister had said. But Mr Peter Robinson, deputy leader of the DUP, scorned recent calls for peace, saying they would come to nothing.

The paper has angered the Democratic Unionist party. The paper confirms the Irish government's willingness to negotiate its territorial claim to Northern Ireland, but says important concessions will be required from Ulster's unionists in return. Mr Peter Robinson, deputy leader of the DUP, said yesterday: 'It is clear the message the Irish government wants to give is that it is digging in its heels.' He and the Reverend Ian Paisley, the party leader, walked out of the talks - which involve the British and Irish Governments and the four Ulster constitutional political parties - last week, saying that unless the Irish Republic 'realistically addresses' its territorial claim to Northern Ireland, they will not participate further. Mr James Molyneaux, the Ulster Unionist party leader, has warned that his delegates will also withdraw from the talks in the coming weeks if there is no indication of progress on this issue. Both parties want the Irish government to commit itself to a referendum to amend Articles Two and Three of the Republic's constitution. Mr Robinson said yesterday: 'We cannot have any relationship with the Irish Republic while they have a territorial claim over Northern Ireland.' The Dublin-based Irish Times published extracts from an Irish government position paper submitted to the talks on August 28. One extract says the Irish government 'does not rule out constitutional change resulting from the present negotiations' but adds that the Irish electorate 'will be particularly sensitive to the impact of any proposed amendment on the position of the nationalist minority in Northern Ireland'. It describes the minority as 'victims' of the Government of Ireland Act, which partitioned Ireland in 1920. The extract goes on to say: 'If as certain delegations have urged, proposals for constitutional change emerging from the negotiations were to include changes to the Irish constitution, the strength and quality of the link between both parts of Ireland would be one of the important factors in shaping the judgment of the electorate in this regard. 'Those who urge that the division introduced by the act should be endorsed by the nationalist community have a corresponding duty to say how the evident flaws of the original, purportedly temporary, provisions would be addressed' The Irish foreign ministry said: 'The talks are confidential and it is regrettable there should be continued leaks. It makes things more difficult for (participants) to reveal their positions if they think it is going to be published in the papers the next day.' ARTICLES TWO AND THREE OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND Article 2 The national territory consists of the whole island of Ireland, its islands and the territorial seas.

'We have to produce a demilitarised nation,' he added at Kennedy airport immediately after arriving from Dublin. 'I want to see an end to all armed conflict in Ireland,' he continued at a press conference. 'The Irish and British people deserve peace.' Asked if the IRA supported a ceasefire, Mr Adams said: 'I don't speak for the IRA; I speak for Sinn Fein.' But he added: 'The largest military presence in the north of Ireland is the British army, followed by the allies of the loyalists and then the IRA. I want to see them all disarmed.' Asked if the British should leave Northern Ireland, Mr Adams said that was not necessary if they became part of the peace process. 'They have to become the persuaders. Once they become part of the peace process then we will be able to build a peaceful country.' Speaking on CNN television last night, Mr Adams reiterated his support for a peaceful solution to the problems in Northern Ireland. He said: 'I want to see the gun taken out of Irish politics. The gun was brought into our affairs by the British. I want to see the IRA disbanded and the British army disbanded. 'I have had the courage to call on the IRA to take part in a demilitarised Northern Ireland.' Mr Adams is in the US for 48 hours for a conference about Northern Ireland organised by an independent think-tank. His visit was made possible when President Bill Clinton decided to grant him a visa, lifting a 20-year ban. The decision to grant the visa was met with outrage by Ulster unionists who warned that the Sinn Fein leader would exploit the visit for propaganda purposes. But it was given a cautious welcome by Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, who said the visit was acceptable if it helped bring closer the prospect of peace. Mr John Hume, leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party, and representatives of the Alliance party are also expected to attend today's conference in the US. Unionists said the decision meant the US had relinquished any right to act as an intermediary in any efforts to bring peace to the province.   Countries:-  USZ  United States of America.

After the first Anglo-Irish conference since December's Downing Street Declaration, he said there was 'a rational ground for being hopeful' that there would be a positive response by Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing. The British and Irish governments have agreed to give Sinn Fein more time to consider their joint peace initiative. In the meantime, however, they will press ahead 'as a matter of urgency' with efforts to restart round-table talks between the province's constitutional parties. Hours after Sir Patrick's remarks, Sinn Fein president Mr Gerry Adams said he was prepared to go 'the extra mile' for peace. 'I am willing to seek to persuade the IRA to make a definitive decision on the conduct of its campaign,' he said in Belfast. Earlier yesterday the US government in effect refused Mr Adams a visa to attend a conference on Northern Ireland in New York on Monday, saying it would only consider lifting its ban on him entering the country if he renounced violence and embraced the peace process. Sir Patrick also hinted at greater flexibility on the British government's refusal to respond to demands by Sinn Fein for clarification of the declaration. He said that 'through speeches' both governments would continue to 'make clear' what the joint declaration offered. 'If there are misapprehensions I will put that right . . . you can call it clarification if you like.' He added that he did not dis-agree with any recent speeches on the declaration made by the Irish prime minister, Mr Albert Reynolds, or the foreign minister, Mr Dick Spring. These had been expressly aimed at clarifying concerns raised by Sinn Fein. Sir Patrick reiterated, however, that there would be no negotiation or 'unravelling' of the agreement. The declaration concedes the principle of national self-determination for the Irish people as a whole, but any new agreement would require majority consent in Northern Ireland. Sir Patrick's positive tone contrasted with the mood at recent private briefings for journalists by the Northern Ireland office, and suggests yesterday's talks have given him reasons for optimism. Mr Spring, asked if he was privy to information that Sinn Fein was moving towards an acceptance of the declaration, said: 'I don't think it would be helpful to go into details.'

0,FT933-561 ,"FT933-561 _AN-DI1CRAGTFT 930928   FT  28 SEP 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (8): Economics and the Irish Question - Economic History      By DOMINICK COYLE   THE IRISH ECONOMY: RESULTS AND PROSPECTS by Ronnie Munck Pluto Press Pounds 10.95 177 pages THE POLITICIANS have not done too well in trying to end the troubles in Northern Ireland, and Ronnie Munck's The Irish Economy: Results and Prospects makes a stab at some alternative scenarios. Could economic logic ultimately drive the two parts of Ireland into some modus vivendi, in the context of the Single European Market? Possibly yes; but then other putative solutions have been singularly unsuccessful over the past 20 years. Munck is a sociologist at the University of Ulster and he writes from a radical perspective, yet he floats notions rather than dogmatic assertions, leaving the impression that he is planting seeds and not surveying the final harvest. Books abound on the economic history of the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. This effort endeavours to trace and quantify their economic development in parallel, to identify similarities and some differences, and to hint that an economic coming together might be for the common good. The trouble is that there is no accepted definition of the common good in an Irish context; there is a Unionist good, a Nationalist good, a Republican good, even an Anglo-Irish good, but they seldom meet, except perhaps at Dublin's Lansdowne Road rugby ground where both sides of the troubled border support the lads in green. Otherwise it is noisy shouting across the community divide, at least in the North, and tragically it is very often much more deadly. Yet both parts of Ireland face common economic problems, each traditionally over-dependent on Britain, although gradually less so for the Republic over recent years. Dublin's campaign to attract multinationals to locate manufacturing operations in the South has had impressive success, aided by generous grants and attractive fiscal concessions. But there have been costs. Repatriation of profits by foreign investors is estimated to exceed 10 per cent of GDP, and when taxation holidays run out some multinationals look for even cheaper manufacturing bases elsewhere. All the while there has been inadequate development and strengthening of indigenous industry. The universities continue to attract more students, the emigrant ships and aircraft more graduates. The historically richer north of Ireland has done little better in recent times; on some criteria even worse. There too incentives were offered to foreign multinationals, but bombs and bullets mean more than cash in corporate decision-making, and the North's economy there would surely collapse were it not for the huge subsidies the province receives from Britain. Northern Ireland's dependence on British subsidies and the earlier abortive De Valera drive in the South for economic self-sufficiency through protectionism - which sparked off the so-called Economic War with Britain - are both lessons in internal economic failure. Ireland's membership of the European Economic Community (EC) has helped the country open up new markets and reduce its dependence on the UK, but as the recent crisis in the ERM amply demonstrated, the trade patterns and currencies of the two countries are still closely related. In the North the economic and political crisis often seems terminal; in the South things appear better. In both parts of the country EC funds have helped somewhat, both directly through the Common Agricultural Policy, and through infrastructural projects assisted by the Regional Development Fund. But Ireland North and South remains a fragile economy on the periphery of Europe, high in unemployment and over-dependent on external forces. Could the sum of the parts improve the whole? Munck - assisted by a colleague, Douglas Hamilton - address this question in a final chapter. The canvas is drawn widely to include five scenarios: continuation of the status quo; some form of devolved government in Northern Ireland - or, at the extreme, complete independence and separation; positions around the concept of economic harmonisation (much closer North-South economic links in a European context); the reunification of Ireland within a capitalist framework; and, finally, reunification within a radical democratic framework. A preferred choice does not shine through: Munck is open-minded, concerned above all to set out the basic facts about how the economies of the two parts of Ireland have developed since the partition. But there is just a hint. He quotes from a 1933 lecture given in Dublin by John Maynard Keynes (De Valera had just come to government and was offering his philosophy of economic self-sufficiency): 'Let goods be homespun wherever it is reasonably and conveniently possible, and above all, let finance be primarily national.' Munck thinks these Keynesian principles retain their relevance for Ireland.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P2731 Book Publishing.   Types:-  TECH  Products  Product use.

A six-week consultation period will be followed by legislation in autumn. The government's advisers hope the sale will take place in the summer of 1994 and will fetch between Pounds 25m and Pounds 40m. The sale will probably be to a single buyer or a consortium rather than by flotation, which would cost too much in relation to the likely proceeds. Aldergrove, also called Belfast International, is owned by Northern Ireland Airports and handled about 2.17m passengers last year, making it the UK's seventh largest airport. It made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 2.14m on turnover of Pounds 21m and last month announced the start of scheduled services to New York. Possible bidders include Canadian transport group Bombardier, which owns both Short Brothers, the Ulster aircraft manufacturer, and Belfast City airport.

0,FT943-5825 ,"FT943-5825 _AN-EICAFAAKFT 940902   FT  02 SEP 94 / Catholic killed in Ulster on first day of IRA ceasefire: Major 'livid' over prisoner transfer to N Ireland      By DAVID OWEN, TIM COONE and WILLIAM LEWIS      LONDON, DUBLIN, BELFAST   The first day of the IRA ceasefire in Northern Ireland ended last night with the killing of a Catholic man in north Belfast and a shooting in another Catholic area of the city. The incidents appeared to damage seriously any immediate prospect of loyalist paramilitaries ending their campaign of violence. The shootings came as a political row erupted over transfer of four Republican prisoners from the mainland to jails in Northern Ireland only hours after the start of the IRA ceasefire. A 'livid' Mr John Major ordered an urgent inquiry into the decision to move the prisoners, which threatened to put the high-risk UK-Irish peace initiative under renewed pressure by undermining efforts to reassure unionists that no secret deals had been entered into in return for Wednesday's IRA announcement. Meanwhile, the prospect of face-to-face meetings by the end of the year between Sinn Fein and the British government moved closer as London acknowledged that amplifications during the day by republican leaders showed they were 'moving in our direction' over the permanency of the IRA ceasefire. Police said the man who died last night was a 32-year-old unemployed labourer. They confirmed that the victim was a Roman Catholic. In a second incident, a car was fired at in in the Old Park area of north Belfast, and a person claiming to represent the loyalist terror group, the Ulster Freedom Fighters, telephoned BBC Radio Belfast to say they had carried out that shooting. Downing Street said the decision to transfer the prisoners to Northern Ireland had been taken by officials without reference to ministers. But Mr Derek Lewis, director-general of the Prison Service said the decision to transfer a total of 14 prisoners - including the four moved today - was made in June by Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary. He said the timing of the transfers, once the decision had been made, was the responsibility of the prison service and had been determined by 'practical' considerations. Among the prisoners transferred was Mr Patrick Magee, who is serving a life sentence for his involvement in the Brighton bomb which devastated the Grand Hotel during the Conservative conference in 1984. The transfer was immediately attacked by Lord Tebbit, the former Conservative cabinet minister, who was badly injured in the blast. He said it was either 'an early reward for the IRA or crass political incompetence'. As the debate continued over whether the IRA had declared a permanent end to its armed campaign, Downing Street emphasised that the three-month countdown to talks with the IRA's political wing would not begin until the organisation's intentions were 'utterly clear'. But Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, who does not share Downing Street's caution, said the controversy over the omission of the word 'permanent' from the IRA's ceasefire statement was over. He used a state-of-the-nation speech to urge all parties to show imagination and flexibility. Nobody, he said, should diminish the potential of the ceasefire 'by trying to interpret it as anything other than what it is'. His comments followed an article by Mr Gerry Adams in The Irish Times in which the Sinn Fein president said: 'Albert Reynolds, Dick Spring, John Hume and others have responded positively and correctly to the IRA announcement.' In a further republican amplification, Mr Martin McGuinness, a member of Sinn Fein's governing executive, said the organisation was committed to 'a complete cessation of military operations under all circumstances'. Meanwhile, in London, Mr Michael Mates, the former Northern Ireland minister, said he thought the countdown to talks between London and Sinn Fein should begin at once. 'I would think it is not unreasonable for the 90 days to start now,' he said. In Washington, there was little tangible evidence that the US was putting flesh on its promise of support to the peace process. In the past, US president Bill Clinton has expressed interest in a visit to Ireland, and there was some preliminary discussion earlier this year of adding Ireland to his itinerary for one of his two trips to Europe.

Mr Adams, continuing his high-profile first visit to the US  in 20 years, listed three points connected with the December  document signed by Mr Major and Irish Prime Minister Albert  Reynolds which he said needed further explanation.    He told an influential New York audience these were:     -  Aspects of the declaration itself;    -  Contradictory  statements about it made by the two premiers;    -  The issue of  processes, measures and steps envisaged by the declaration.    He spoke out as the US administration sent what may well be  a  signal to him, by calling on all parties to the Northern Ireland  conflict to embrace the Downing Street peace declaration.    The US statement, speaking of an ""historic opportunity"" to  end the violence, was released after Vice President Al Gore met  Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd in Washington.    Mr Adams, the Sinn Fein president, listed his demands during  an address to the National Committee on American Foreign Policy,  the high point of his 48-hour stay.    He told an audience of 300 in New York's Waldorf-Astoria  hotel -- venue for the Committee's conference on Northern  Ireland -- that the US could make a ""significant and positive""  role to achieving peace.    But he accused the British Government of stalling by  refusing  to clarify the December 15 peace declaration.    But his statement brought a strong retort from Mr Major.    In the Commons, the Prime Minister accused Sinn Fein of  ""prevarications"" and ""evasions"" about the ending of violence.    Mr Major said: ""There has been no commitment by Mr Adams or  the Provisional movement to end violence for good.    ""That is the commitment that this House and everybody in  this  country and Ireland is waiting to hear.""    Mr Adams was on day two of his visit, authorised by  President  Clinton against the wishes of the Major Government. He has  conducted a series of coast-to-coast TV interviews amid huge  press interest, as well as meetings with top American  politicians.    He told his audience that Irish republicans had to decide  whether the Anglo-Irish document was a first step for the  British Government in the direction of lasting peace, or merely  a political response by a government under pressure, aimed at  avoiding a political confrontation with Dublin.    He said: ""The Joint Declaration is described by its authors  as `the first step' towards a peace settlement.    ""Sinn Fein is committed to such a settlement and I am  concerned -- I am indeed anxious -- to be persuaded that the  Downing Street declaration can provide the basis for this.    ""And even if this is not the case -- if there is a gap  between what it required and what is on offer -- then we should  all move to bridge that gap.""    Mr Adams said the exercise of the right of Irish  self-determination required a change in British policy and the  removal of the veto on change in Northern Ireland held by the  majority Unionist community.    He acknowledged the democratic rights of the Unionists, but  claimed they would be upheld in an independent Ireland.    ""The argument that the consent of a national minority,  elevated into a majority within an undemocratic  artifically-created state, is necessary before a constitutional  change can occur is a nonsense,"" he said.    Mr Adams also claimed that the Downing Street declaration  was  a response to proposals made after a series of talks he had with  Ulster's Social Democratic and Labour Party leader John Hume  last year.    He said it would be judged on whether it advanced the peace  process or just a ""cosmetic response"" to that peace initiative.    There was a degree of suspicion and scepticism among  nationalists and republicans regarding the real motives and  intentions of the British Government.    He did not mention whether the IRA would declare a  ceasefire,  Britain's precondition for Sinn Fein's participation in peace  talks.    Awaiting him back in Belfast was a letter he requested from  Mr Reynolds clarifying the declaration from the Irish  government's point of view.    He added that the British government's refusal to ""provide  clarification for Sinn Fein must be a matter of deep concern to  everyone interested in peace.""    ""In contrast...it is clear that for the first time a Dublin  government is making a serious attempt to address the issue of  peace and a political settlement in the north of Ireland,"" he  said.    ""I wish to commend Albert Reynolds. He has taken a postive  and commonsense attitude to the need to provide clarification.    ""The potential for peace in Ireland has never been more  realisable.""    And he made clear that Americans and the Clinton  administration could be actively involved in the peace process  and bring pressure to bear on Britain to break the deadlock.    ""Progressive opinion in the U.S.A. can assist in the  development of a peace process in Ireland. The U.S. government  can play a significant and positive role in encouraging the  process by helping to create a climate that moves the situation  on,"" he said.    He said the U.S. government could achieve that goal in two  ways -- by facilitating the free exchange of information and,  obviously referring to Britain, ""actively seeking to encourage  dialogue and agreement.""    Mr Adams added: ""It is clear that the British government  have  used all their influence, as in the past, to impede any progress  on this or in any other matter which could influence or inform  perceptions about the current situation in Ireland and the  British government's responsibility for the present intolerable  standoff.""    He again praised President Clinton for permitting his visa  to  enter the U.S., and drew a parallel between the situation in  Northern Ireland and current political moves in South Africa and  the Middle East.    The lessons from those two areas were clear -- and ""the  conflict in Ireland is no different.""    Mr Adams was the third of three Ulster political leaders to  speak at the conference, behind the middle-of-the-road Alliance  Party chief Dr John Alderdice and Mr Hume.    Absent, though, were Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist  Party boss the Rev Ian Paisley and Ulster Unionist leader James  Molyneaux.    Both stayed away in protest at the involvement of Sinn Fein  and to underline their distaste at Mr Adams finally getting his  visa.    The US statement released by the White House said Mr Gore,  in  his meeting with Mr Hurd, ""underscored our admiration for the  courage and vision of Prime Ministers Major and Reynolds in  putting forward a new framework for peace in Northern Ireland.""    ""He (Gore) reiterated our conviction that the December 15  Joint Declaration of the two governments provides an historic  opportunity to end the tragic violence,"" the statement said.    ""It provides a process by which all parties who eschew  violence -- in deeds as well as words -- can participate in  building a peaceful and prosperous Northern Ireland,"" it read.    Mr Gore also emphasised ""the importance the U.S. attaches to  close cooperation with our British ally on a range of global  issues,"" the statement added.    British officials, although reportedly unhappy with the  decision to reverse the 20-year policy and allow Mr Adams into  the U.S., have not criticised Washington publicly.    In London, Mr Major declared that the peace initiative  ""leaves no conceivable excuse for violence.""    ""And all the words, all the prevarications, all the evasions  of Sinn Fein will be utterly and completely hollow until they  end violence.""    Mr Adams was being subjected to only low-key security.  Volunteer members of the New York police pipe ban were assigned  to protect him ""in a discreet way,"" according to security  sources.     "
0,FT944-5245 ,"FT944-5245 _AN-ELECYABOFT 941205   FT  05 DEC 94 / Paisley boycott may deter businesses      By JOHN MURRAY BROWN   The Rev Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionist party is to boycott next week's Northern Ireland investment conference. His announcement, made during the party's annual conference at Dungannon at the weekend, comes as little surprise. Mr Paisley remains implacably opposed to any contact with Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing. Once Downing Street had confirmed that Sinn Fein councillors on the Belfast and Derry economic committees had been invited to the investment conference, Mr Paisley's reaction was inevitable. The DUP's absence will nonetheless reinforce Ulster's image as a divided society, and could make it more difficult for the Northern Ireland Office to convince business that now is the time to invest in the province's future. Next week's conference is intended to be a showpiece for foreign investors, and to provide evidence that Ulster is ready to end its internal strife and forge a new consensus. One unionist councillor said: 'It's sad that this could upset the apple cart. Foreign investors will say 'if the parties can't sit down together, then why should we put our money here?' ' Yet many unionists are alarmed at the way London is seen to have 'bent over backwards' under US pressure to accommodate Sinn Fein. Unionist sensitivities have been aggravated by remarks by Mr Albert Reynolds, outgoing Irish prime minister, who warned over the weekend that Sinn Fein should not be treated as a 'second-class political party' in the peace process. He said: 'That sort of penny-pinching attitude risked sending the wrong signals to the Sinn Fein leadership.' His remarks help to reinforce the impression in unionist circles that the republicans are forcing the pace. 'It's all one way, isn't it. They're getting everything - we're getting nothing,' said a young Protestant woman in Belfast selling loyalist memorabilia to raise money for her husband and other loyalist prisoners. 'The republican prisoners will be out long before my man,' she said. In some respects, unionism itself seems to be in crisis. In working class communities Mr Paisley is no longer seen as offering a lead. His standing among the grass roots has been eclipsed by politicians such as Mr David Ervine and Mr Gary McMichael, and others close to the loyalist paramilitaries. In rural areas, and among middle class protestants, it is Mr James Molyneaux's Official Unionists who hold the ring. Mr Paisley's antics have seemed increasingly extreme in recent weeks. At the party's annual conference over the weekend he threatened to 'wreck' any new Northern Ireland assembly. 'If there is an election to any assembly here we will be fighting it, we will give the people of Northern Ireland the right to be represented there and we will use our position in that assembly to destroy that assembly,' Mr Paisley said. Going further, he hinted at moves to challenge the legality of the Downing Street declaration, signed by London and Dublin last December. The declaration provides the guidelines for the framework document which the two governments hope will form the basis for talks between Ulster's principal parties.

Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, said on Irish radio that reports of British concessions on the constitutional issue were 'ill-informed nonsense'. He confirmed that the Irish government was willing to offer a written pledge to hold a referendum - but only as part of an overall settlement. The talks were still 'firmly on course' in spite of serious disagreements exposed on Friday. He added, however, that time might be running out for a deal. Mr Reynolds said later in a television interview that Ireland was halfway to peace. Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, bluntly rejected suggestions that Britain agreed to compromise on the Irish claim to Ulster during talks in Dublin on Friday. He said there had been 'no softening on any point of principle. The principle here - and this is the key to the whole thing - is consent.' Mr Hurd said the talks between Mr John Major, the British prime minister, and Mr Reynolds had gone through some 'rough passages'. But there was agreement on both sides that the future of Northern Ireland would remain firmly in the hands of the people of the province. His remarks were intended to reassure unionists that the government would not accept any deal which failed to include an Irish referendum on articles 2 and 3 of the republic's constitution, which lay claim to Northern Ireland. Officials said the government's position might have been misinterpreted because of confusion about the form a peace agreement might take. One suggestion is that the first paper produced by the talks would be restricted to a general statement of principles, intended to sustain the momentum of the process. It would be followed by a more detailed paper in which the republic would be expected to offer guarantees that a referendum on the disputed articles would form part of an overall peace agreement.

The UK accepted an increase in cross-border co-operation and the possibility of Sinn Fein entering talks if the IRA laid down its arms. The six-point plan set out last week by Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, paved the way for the initiative. The six points were: People in Ireland, north and south, without coercion and without violence, should be free to determine their own future. New structures should be developed for governing the province, for north-south relationships and for UK-Irish relations. No agreement can be reached on any change in the status of Northern Ireland without the freely expressed consent of the majority of the people of Northern Ireland. Unionist consent will be required for any constitutional change in the north. The Irish constitution will be amended 'at the right time and in the right circumstances' to reflect any agreed changes. There will be a place at the negotiating table for the 'men of violence' if they cease their violence. The SDLP and Sinn Fein are concerned by Mr Spring's apparent acceptance of a unionist veto - as opposed to a majority veto - over constitutional change in Northern Ireland. On Irish radio yesterday, Mr Reynolds referred only to majority consent. The statement from the UK and the republic was unequivocal that there could be 'no question of adopting or endorsing' the Hume-Adams initiative, which envisages a simultaneous referendum north and south of the border on any future changes to Northern Ireland's status, but recognises the principle of majority consent in the north. The last series of talks between the four main Ulster constitutional parties broke up last November without agreement.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.     IEZ  Ireland, EC.

0,FT941-11771 ,"FT941-11771 _AN-EBCDJAAEFT 940203   FT  03 FEB 94 / Mayhew plans fresh Ulster move: Downing Street to bring forward new ideas for devolved government in the province      By MICHAEL CASSELL and PHILIP STEPHENS      BELFAST, LONDON   The British government will within the next two weeks bring forward fresh proposals for a new political settlement in Northern Ireland in a move calculated to wrest back the initiative from Sinn Fein. As the government stepped up its efforts to limit the impact of this week's highly publicised visit to the US by Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, said he would put forward fresh ideas for devolved government in the province and formal mechanisms for enhancing cross-border co-operation. Sir Patrick repeated the invitation to Sinn Fein to enter exploratory discussions within three months of a permanent end to violence. But he strongly rejected accusations from some Ulster politicians that the government was dragging its feet on the parallel search for a political settlement. He said the talks process was 'alive and well' and ready to move into higher gear. His remarks came amid growing signs of impatience over Sinn Fein's position from Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister. Mr Reynolds said yesterday: 'I have spent some time now in giving out an abundance of clarifications and I think the time is coming when I expect to get some clarification in return.' Sir Patrick emphasised the planned framework for a political settlement would simultaneously involve both the so-called 'strand one' discussions - on internal political arrangements for the province - and 'strand two' - the relationships between the province and the Irish Republic. The province's constitutional parties now wanted to see 'focus and direction' given to talks which so far had been exploratory and disparate, he said. They would continue on the same bilateral basis as the discussions suspended at the end of 1992. Round-table talks, he added, were not yet wanted by any of the participants. The hard-line Democratic Unionist party, led by the Rev Ian Paisley, has said it will not rejoin bilateral or round-table discussions if meetings continue between Sinn Fein and the Social Democratic and Labour party. The devolution plans embrace proposals for a new assembly, which has already attracted some measure of agreement between the parties. Sir Patrick emphasised both governments were anxious for a return to devolved government in the province. But he also moved to reassure unionists that talks about cross-border co-operation, including the possible establishment of new executive boards, would not involve any joint authority. He said: 'Joint authority over Northern Ireland is not on at all. Nobody is going to pretend that the majority of people living in Northern Ireland are going to agree to joint authority.' But he emphasised there were many opportunities for joint action in areas such as tourism and the environment. Winding up his US tour, Mr Adams promised he would make 'concrete' decisions soon on his party's role in the peace process. Earlier, Downing Street accused him of laying a 'smokescreen of evasions and falsehoods'. It welcomed President Bill Clinton's call for Sinn Fein to support the joint declaration, which it said showed the US administration was not going to be 'sidetracked' by Sinn Fein.

As the British government sought to reassure Unionists at Westminster by giving the go-ahead for a Northern Ireland parliamentary select committee, Mr Gerry Adams, president of the IRA's political wing, said he was still 'personally and politically' committed to helping secure peace in Northern Ireland. But he warned there were 'no quick fixes' to the province's problems. His statement reflected the difficulties the Republican movement is having in co-ordinating a response to the prime minister's main demand that the IRA should lay down its arms. It is understood that an early meeting between senior Sinn Fein officials and members of the IRA on Wednesday failed to produce an agreed response to the joint declaration. The final decision is in the hands of the IRA's Army Council which is understood not to have met in full session on the issue. Mr Adams said the Downing Street declaration was the product of 'frenzied activity' by the two governments after his talks with Mr John Hume, leader of the mainly Roman Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party, had 'focused them on this issue'. He would be seeking clarification from Dublin on some aspects of Wednesday's statement by the UK and Irish prime ministers. At Westminster, Mr Major came under pressure from his own back benches over whether the declaration diluted the government's commitment to the Union. In an acid exchange, he clashed with Mr Norman Lamont over the former chancellor's assertion that the declaration stood 'a little oddly' with his speech to the Conservative party conference in October. In contrast to the cross-party plaudits for the government on Wednesday, there were further backbench rumblings in the wake of a signal from Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, that the government might begin talks with Sinn Fein without waiting for the IRA to hand in its weapons. One Tory MP accused the government of giving in to terrorists. Downing Street said the select committee decision - announced yesterday by Mr Tony Newton, the Commons leader - was not related to the Anglo-Irish declaration on Northern Ireland, which was 'on a separate track'. Officials said the decision - which was not communicated in advance to Mr Reynolds or Mr James Molyneaux, the Ulster Unionist party leader - was taken by Mr Newton after consultation with Mr Major and Sir Patrick. The IRA last night claimed responsibility for two bombs discovered earlier by the track near Brookwood railway station, Surrey. Army teams blew up the packages at the station.

Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, said that after their Brussels' meeting he had agreed with Mr Major some '70 per cent' of the proposed joint statement they hope might persuade the IRA to end violence. That raised expectations that two leaders could hold a further meeting this week to clear the remaining obstacles. Officials from both governments worked through the weekend on the text and Mr Major and Mr Reynolds plan to speak on the phone later today to assess progress. As Mr Major consulted cabinet colleagues, Downing Street still appeared hopeful of a pre-Christmas accord. But the Irish prime minister warned he was not prepared to sign an anodyne declaration which would not offer a reasonable prospect of a permanent cessation of violence. Amid pessimism in Dublin on the prospects for a substantive statement, Mr Reynolds said that guarantees for the Protestant majority in Ulster had to be balanced by recognition of the nationalist aspirations of a large minority. The key differences now centre on the issues of self-determination and on Dublin's proposal for an all-Ireland convention, involving all political parties north and south. Mr Reynolds signalled in Brussels that he could accept a statement which did not explicitly endorse the 'value' of eventual unity. But Dublin's acceptance of a unionist veto over any change in Ulster's status had to be set in the wider context of Irish self-determination. Irish government officials reaffirmed yesterday that Mr Reynolds 'will not sign a statement that will not achieve the result of a cessation of violence'. If agreement could not be reached, a final pre-Christmas summit was unlikely. The two governments' task in attempting to square the circle between unionist fears and nationalist terrorism was underlined by a blunt warning from two leading members of the Ulster Unionist party directed at Mr Major. Mr John Taylor, MP for Stangford, said any move towards a united Ireland would prompt his party to threaten the government's majority by opposing it in any vote of confidence. Mr David Trimble, MP for Upper Bann, accused Mr Reynolds of 'effectively acting on behalf of the IRA'. He said Mr Reynolds, by taking on the Hume-Adams proposals, was talking about 'surrender by stages' to the IRA. He rejected any concessions to Mr Reynolds's proposals and ruled out the possibility of agreeing to a peace conference representing all parties in the republic and Northern Ireland. But Mr Gerry Adams, the leader of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, repeated his call for Irish self-determination. He said acceptance of the need for majority consent in Northern Ireland had to be seen as an interim part of a process towards national self-determination. Meanwhile Sir Hugh Annesley, chief constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, said that the IRA had nothing to offer Northern Ireland except death and suffering. His comments came after two police officers were shot dead by IRA gunmen at Five-miletown in Fermanagh. Several people were arrested.   Countries:-  IEZ  Ireland, EC.     GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

The disclosure by Mr Mitchel McLaughlin, Sinn Fein's northern chairman, came as the Northern Ireland Office announced that next week's talks with the IRA's political wing had been put back 48 hours to December 9 at Sinn Fein's request. Whitehall officials said last night that they had been given no explanation for the delay, beyond being told that the Sinn Fein delegation wanted more time to prepare. Meanwhile, it emerged that Mr McLaughlin is among six Sinn Fein councillors who have been invited to an important Belfast investment conference to be launched by the prime minister on December 13 and 14. It was initially decided that Sinn Fein would not be invited to attend the conference. But the government appeared to change its stance after several US institutions threatened to boycott it. Mr McLaughlin said Sinn Fein was 'prepared, perfectly prepared, to discuss the issue of the amount of weapons that are in circulation in Ireland, both legal and illegal'. But he said the weapons question had to be resolved in the context of discussions on 'the political conditions in Ireland and how we can replace those failed political structures with agreed political structures'. The British government wants the issue of paramilitary arsenals to be addressed in the preliminary talks due to begin next week and not in future political negotiations to which Sinn Fein and loyalist representatives may in time be admitted. Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, said yesterday that preliminary discussions 'must elicit proposals for the disposal of arms and explosives'. Mr John Major, the prime minister, used a speech to the Conservative Women's conference in London yesterday to confirm that the government would also begin talks with loyalist political representatives before Christmas.

The news outraged Ulster Unionist politicians, who accused  President Clinton of an about-turn on his administration's  previous demand that Mr Adams should publicly renounce violence  and back the Anglo-Irish peace declaration before being admitted.    But a statement from the White House said: ""The President  supports this difficult decision and believes it will help  advance the cause of peace in Northern Ireland.""    Mr Adams will be allowed to stay only 48 hours, will be  barred from travelling more than 25 miles from New York and from  engaging in ""direct or indirect fund raising"" during his visit  for Tuesday's [1 February] conference, the White House said.    For the past 20 years the Sinn Fein president has been  barred  from entering America despite numerous efforts to gain a visa.  He applied at the American embassy in Dublin on January 14 for  the visa to attend the conference organised by the National  Committee on American Foreign Policy. The honorary chairman of  the committee is former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger  and all sides have been invited to attend the one-day  conference. But Unionist politicians have declined the  invitation, and tonight Ulster Unionist MP John D Taylor  condemned the U.S. decision as ""despicable,"" saying the Clinton  administration had ""given in"" to pressure from the Irish lobby  in Washington.    ""The White House now wishes to facilitate the apologists for  the IRA murder campaign in Ireland,"" the MP for Strangford  declared.    ""The people of Northern Ireland say to Clinton: `You should  be ashamed of yourself -- no longer can you condemn terrorism  elsewhere in the free world.'""    Mr Adams told reporters tonight that the object of his visit  was not merely to brief Irish supporters on the status of  current peace moves but to collect the views of Irish  expatriates.    The U.S. administration admitted it consulted the British  and  Irish Governments while considering the application.    London, which has an exclusion order preventing Mr Adams  from  entering mainland Britain, argued the ban should remain.    The Irish government made no public comment but is  understood  to have urged in private that the visa be granted. The Dublin  view prevailed. [passage omitted]    Mr Maginnis, MP for Fermanagh and South Tyrone, said tonight  it appeared the U.S. Government had ""watered down considerably""  its requirement for the Sinn Fein president to renounce violence.    ""I think it is disappointing that the Americans have  capitulated on something which for them should have been a  matter of principle,"" he said, adding: ""I think it diminishes Mr  Clinton.""    Mr Maginnis also said the conference would be undermined if  it was felt more important to have the presence of ""an advocate  of terrorism"" rather than representatives of the greater number  of people in Northern Ireland. [passage omitted]    Mr Taylor told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I think it's  obscene. I think the White House has lost all moral authority  and cannot condemn terrorism elsewhere in the world while they  facilitate someone like Gerry Adams.""    Mr Alderdice [Alliance Party leader] told the programme:  ""Clearly I am disappointed. There has been an enormous amount  of Republican and Irish nationalist pressure on Mr Clinton to  make this decision.""    Mr Alderdice, who is in the U.S., added: ""I'm going to put  forward the views of the majority of the people in Northern  Ireland who don't want to see the violence and regard the whole  position of Mr Adams as highly repugnant.""    Peter Robinson, Democratic Unionist Party MP for Belfast  East, said: ""Now the people of Northern Ireland will see that  democracy counts for nothing.    ""If you are a gunman then there are people who want to hear  you. There are people who will roll out the carpet for you. But  if you are a simple democrat who abides by the ballot box then  nobody wants to hear you.""    Michael Mates, the former Northern Ireland minister, told  the  programme he was surprised the U.S. had granted Mr Adams a visa  in advance of reaching agreement over the joint declaration.    ""It is exactly what Adams wants. He wants to go on being  able to procrastinate in order to put pressure on both  governments to make some more concessions before the killing  stops,"" he said.    Joe Hendron, SDLP MP for West Belfast, told the programme Mr  Adams was having problems getting agreement to the declaration  among the republican movement.    ""If getting a visa to participate in this so-called  high-powered discussion in the U.S., if this helps Mr Adams in  terms of his credibility amongst his own peers, his own  followers, then that can only be a good thing,"" he said.    Democratic Unionist Party leader the Rev Ian Paisley  accused the U.S. administration of ""kowtowing"" to the Boston  Irish Lobby and going back on previous decisions.    He said of Gerry Adams: ""He might declare a very short  ceasefire which will be hailed as a tremendous breakthrough.    ""This is a propaganda exercise. It is telling against the  British Government because the British Government are losing  every round of the battle.""    President Clinton had no authority in Northern Ireland, Mr  Paisley told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme, adding: ""He should  clean up the mess in his own back yard without interfering in  Northern Ireland.""

He warned that whether Sinn Fein joined or stayed out the  Government wanted to continue to seek political progress through  talks involving the constitutional parties in the province.  ""There can be no question of Sinn Fein having a veto on  progress,"" he insisted.    Mr Hurd told a Tory meeting in Westminster: ""If Sinn Fein  and  the Provisional IRA renounce support for violence and terrorism  permanently, then Sinn Fein could join this political progress.  They can then contribute to deciding on the future for Northern  Ireland by democratic means. The offer is on the table and will  stay there.""    Mr Hurd said market research showed that 97 percent of the  people in Ireland backed the declaration when it was issued.    ""Only Sinn Fein have given no response. In the United States  Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, obscured the real reason.  At his party conference this weekend, Sinn Fein have another  opportunity to give their response. They should do so.""    Mr Hurd added: ""There are no good reasons for further delay.  Britain and Ireland are today close partners, both in planning  the future of these two islands and in Europe. We are in  complete agreement that the future of the people of the island  of Ireland must be determined by its people. The process must  be one of self-determination, not one in which others try to  impose a solution, and not one in which a solution will be  imposed by a particular party or by violence.""    He warned: ""Moreover -- and this is central to the message  for Sinn Fein -- an enforced settlement that ignores present  realities could never succeed. Holding the view that partition  is wrong does not justify trying to enforce Irish unity.  Differences within the island of Ireland will never be bridged  by an imposed settlement. Terrorism can only reinforce these  differences. What is needed is agreement and consent between  the people of the island of Ireland, North and South.""    He added: ""It is not for the Government to act as a  persuader  for any particular outcome.""     "

Addressing backbenchers from the British and Irish parliaments at a meeting of the interparliamentary body in Dublin, Mr Reynolds said he remained hopeful that last December's joint declaration would produce results - but added that he was disappointed with progress to date. There had been 'little new evidence' that the two communities in the province were likely to reach agreement if 'left to themselves'. The two governments would have to play a role 'in encouraging, and maybe to some degree formulating an outline of an agreement between them', he said. The joint declaration made both governments 'effectively persuaders for an agreement'. Earlier this month Mr Reynolds revealed that the two governments had begun drafting a 'framework document' around which a future political settlement might be built. But in his clearest acknowledgement yet that the peace process has in effect stalled, Mr Reynolds cast doubt on whether Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, has the coherence and unity to deliver on its stated desire for a peace deal, and called for a more 'enlightened' leadership from the unionist parties. He added that both governments 'would be anxious and willing to break the present impasse' if Sinn Fein made clear what issues it still wanted clarified. His remarks came as Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, urged Sinn Fein to specify in what respects they believed the document to be unclear. The government had had to conclude that what 'clarification' really meant was 'renegotiation', Sir Patrick said. 'We are not getting into that,' he said. 'Nor are the Irish government.' Sir Patrick said that the declaration's non-partisan approach meant nobody needed to fear that their position would be 'ignored or excluded'. The ending of violence in Northern Ireland was 'a prize that threatens no one'. He added: 'It should relegate confrontation to the past.'   Countries:-  IEZ  Ireland, EC.

He is convinced that nationalism, be it catholic- or protestant-orientated, will gradually dissipate in the new European union that is being forged in Brussels. This conviction is the driving force behind his vision for new political structures in Northern Ireland which, he believes, will eventually transcend the border on the island of Ireland and make it irrelevant. Mr Hume says: 'What we are facing is an absolute reality that the world is a smaller place, in terms of technology, transport and communications. It is natural that that change should be reflected in political institutions. Once upon a time we had city-states. Then we moved to nation-states and now we are moving to a continental one. It is a natural evolution. We are living in a post-nationalist world'. Is he not discouraged by the recent chaos in the ERM and the setbacks to monetary union? 'It simply reinforces my view that the logic of a single market is a single currency' he replies. John Hume cut his political teeth in the civil rights movement in Londonderry in the late 1960s, when he sat in front of British armoured cars and mediated between crowds of rock-throwing youths and army officers, was drenched by water cannons and arrested for his efforts. He went on to become a founding member of the SDLP in 1970 - 'to re-define nationalism,' in his own words. 'The problem is about people, not territory - it is the people that are divided, not the territory. We have to find the mechanisms for uniting people. Only when people start working together, spilling sweat and not blood, will the old prejudices disappear. There is no other way of solving the problem'. One of his abiding memories is as a 10-year-old watching an Orange Order march in Derry, when his father, unemployed at the time, placed a hand on his shoulder and said: 'Just remember, John, you can't eat flags.' John Hume says he was strongly influenced by the non-violent preachings for change advocated by Martin Luther King in the US, and by the whole process of the creation of the European Community. He has been in talks with Mr Gerry Adams, the leader of Sinn Fein, since last April, with a view to bringing about a permanent ceasefire between the IRA and the Loyalist paramilitaries in the province. Mr Hume is not one to be baulked by criticism of his ideas or his tactics. 'I am criticised for my approaches, but nobody else is putting any new proposals on the table. I want to see an agreed Ireland, not a united Ireland. I want a new Ireland in a new Europe. I am more confident now about the future than I have been for the past 20 years.

The company said yesterday that it was investing Pounds 9.5m at a site being developed by the Industrial Development Board at Dungannon, Co Tyrone, an unemployment blackspot. Carmen, whose equipment is sold in the UK under the Goodmans name, will be making car stereos at the plant and expects to complete its local recruitment by 1996. The IDB said it had secured the project in the face of stiff competition from several other European countries. Mr Robert Atkins, Ulster's economy minister, said the investment would create significant employment and skills opportunities in the area. He said Carmen had been attracted to Dungannon partly because of the successful power-sharing arrangement on the local authority. Unionist and Nationalist councillors introduced a power-sharing arrangement several years ago whereby the mayor's post is rotated every six months. Mr KH Choy, Carmen's president, said the company had decided to locate to Northern Ireland because the province provided a cost-effective base to expand into the European Community and develop sales in eastern Europe. 'We selected Northern Ireland as our European manufacturing centre because it provides an ideal springboard from which to expand our already substantial field base throughout the EC,' he said.

Mr McNamara said the current European debate was vital to Northern Ireland. 'In particular, we have to look at potential impact of the development of the European Community in terms of its effect on political institutions, civil liberties and the economy. 'I believe that a successful outcome (to the current Ulster talks) will be more likely if we succeed in Europeanising the issues,' he said. 'Included in the deliberations should be consideration of the relationship between any new political institutions and Europe. 'For instance, the cases for independent and separate representation for Northern Ireland in the decision-making processes of the Community should be examined.' Mr McNamara said he believed the idea that the current round of talks was about a return to Stormont was 'misplaced'.

In an extensive survey covering 9,000 companies in the services and manufacturing sectors, the British Chambers of Commerce reported that sales and orders of manufacturing exports did not improve in the three months to June. For the second consecutive quarter only one in five companies reported higher export sales and orders. The overall conclusion from the quarterly economic survey was that the recovery re-mains broadly based and grad-ual, with domestic demand on a steadily upwards trend. Small companies continue to lag the bigger ones, with only one in 10 small businesses enjoying growing order books. The balance of manufacturing companies enjoying higher domestic sales compared with the previous quarter rose from 5 per cent to 19 per cent. There was a similar jump in performance of service-sector companies. A balance of 27 per cent of companies reported higher quarter-on-quarter sales, against only 13 per cent in the first three months of the year. The chambers' main concern was export markets. 'Our ability to compete internationally remains patchy,' said Mr Christopher Stewart-Smith, president of the chambers. While worries about inflation and interest-rate levels had eased, there was concern that the UK's competitive edge which followed devaluation might be eroded. There was good news on investment. Manufacturing and service-sector companies revised their investment plans upwards. The rise in sales in the second quarter has also led to an increase in the number of firms working at full capacity, with 22 per cent of manufacturers claiming no excess. A regional breakdown shows the Home Counties and the Thames Valley at the forefront of growth in the second quarter, with both regions experiencing strong rises in export and domestic demand. Although the improved performance by the manufacturing sector was fairly evenly spread across the country, Scotland and Northern Ireland lagged behind other regions. Demand for exports in Scotland slowed and manufacturing confidence was poor. In Northern Ireland the weakness was concentrated in domestic sales which fell over the quarter, while manufacturing exporters improved on first quarter growth. In the service sector, export growth was fairly buoyant, with the southern regions reporting strong performance. Even in London, sales growth in the service sector was higher than the national average. The chambers found the most worrying development in London was the sharp fall in the rate of growth of manufacturing exports. In addition, employment intentions in manufacturing industry were worse in the capital than anywhere else in the country. Growth in the east Midlands continued to be buoyant, with exporters maintaining sales growth and increasing orders. The economy in the north-east continued to perform well in manufacturing and services, but growth in orders in both sectors slowed.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

The Irish cabinet was briefed yesterday afternoon by Mr Albert Reynolds, the prime minister, and Mr Dick Spring, the foreign minister, who through informal channels have been informed of the latest developments in republican thinking. After the meeting a government spokesman said: 'We are hopeful that what we are going to hear will be a permanent cessation of violence.' He said that Dublin's understanding of the announcement was that it would be permanent. The spokesman added: 'There are no pacts, no deals and no terms. They are making their decision in the light of the current political situation.' Mr Reynolds said last night: 'I believe we are poised for peace and that in a very short time we will be able to make an entirely new beginning in the island . . . a complete cessation of violence and the principles of the Downing Street declaration are our new starting point.' The growing hopes follow Monday night's comments by Mr Gerry Adams that he had told the IRA leadership he believed the time was right for a truce. Mr John Hume, the leader of the mainly Roman Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party who held talks with Mr Adams at the weekend, said yesterday: 'Our objective is a total cessation of violence and surely everybody wants to see that.' Dublin now has a delicate balancing act to play in the event of an IRA ceasefire. It must try and reassure the Northern Ireland unionists that they are not about to be forced into a united Ireland. At the same time Dublin must also reassure Sinn Fein and the IRA that a permanent cessation of violence will bring a rapid incorporation of Sinn Fein into negotiations through the Forum of Peace and Reconciliation, as laid out in last December's Downing Street declaration. The aim of the forum will be to bring together the different strands of nationalism throughout Ireland and attempt to create a united front for future all-party negotiations. A statement by Mr Reynolds last Sunday clearly alluded to this. He said: 'It remains my view, both as Taoiseach (prime minister) and as leader of Fianna Fail that in the longer term a united Ireland achieved by agreement offers the best and most durable basis for peace and stability.' He went on to rule out any return to 'majoritarian rule' in Northern Ireland. The tone of that statement is being seen as a firm message to Sinn Fein that the nationalist agenda will be vigorously pursued by the Irish government, the SDLP and Sinn Fein, in the event of an end to violence. That scenario has alarmed unionists however, who are already divided in their approach to the peace process. They fear that a deal has been done between London and Dublin, and that they will be left isolated. In an attempt to allay these fears, the Irish government, Mr Hume and Mr Adams have all stressed in recent days that any future constitutional changes in Northern Ireland would require agreement with the unionists through a process of negotiation and dialogue. Mr Spring said yesterday: 'Nobody has anything to fear from a cessation of violence.'   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.     IEZ  Ireland, EC.   Industries:-  P9721 International Affairs.

His announcement of a 'cautious peace dividend' will give a boost to the local economy before next week's International Investment Conference in Belfast. The announcement comes only four days before the planned opening talks between British government officials and Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing. The savings, which Sir Patrick announced with public spending plans for the province, represent cuts in the compensation paid for bomb and other terrorist damage to property and a planned reduction in the overtime bill of the Royal Ulster Constabulary. The savings will be reallocated to the education and health budgets. Spending on law and order, excluding army costs which are carried by the Ministry of Defence, comes to Pounds 889m a year. About Pounds 50m will be saved this year, rising to Pounds 60m in 1996-97 and a further Pounds 70m in 1997-98. RUC overtime currently costs Pounds 82m a year. Overall spending for Northern Ireland over the period is expected to remain fairly constant at Pounds 8bn in real terms. Sir Patrick warned, however, that the measures were contingent on the ceasefire being maintained. He emphasised that RUC staffing numbers would remain the same, and that recent security moves, such as reducing police and army presence on the streets, could be reversed 'within 24 hours'. Sir Patrick said: 'I hope that we are entering a new phase in the history of Northern Ireland. 'Peace, if it is seen to be established, will provide a chance for a fresh start for the people of Northern Ireland who for the first time in 25 years have had the opportunity to experience daily life free from the fear of violence.' Sir Patrick said there had been a 'substantial' number of acceptances of invitations to the investment conference. Invitations went out to all elected MPs and MEPs for the opening dinner. The government said that representatives from the economic committees in Belfast and Londonderry city councils had been invited to the working sessions. Sinn Fein seemed set to boycott the investment conference, however, saying it had been snubbed and demanding treatment equal to that of the other political parties. The row surfaced after it emerged that a full invitation to the dinner had been sent to Mr John Alderdice of the Alliance party, who is a local councillor and whose party has smaller electoral support than Sinn Fein. Government officials yesterday said the three Belfast Sinn Fein councillors, Mr Mairtin Muilleoir, Mr Joe Austin and Ms Una Gillespie, had initially indicated that they would attend the Wednesday sessions. Yet Sinn Fein said yesterday it was boycotting the conference and the three councillors briefly picketed the offices of the Industrial Development Board, which is organising the conference, saying that they were treated as 'second class citizens'.

The Combined Loyalist Military Command - the umbrella group for the Ulster Defence Association, which has subsumed the Ulster Freedom Fighters, and the separate Ulster Volunteer Force - is understood to be finalising details of an announcement after reaching agreement in principle to call a halt. The announcement could come by the weekend, when the Ulster Unionist party meets for its conference - or even today, as the Conservative party conference debates Northern Ireland. The process speeded up when the government gave loyalist leaders special permission to go into the Maze Prison on Monday to discuss the issue in separate meetings with UDA and UVF inmates. The CLMC is reported to be considering linking their ceasefire with a demand for talks between their political representatives and the government, and to saying their ceasefire will be as 'permanent' as the IRA's. In an interview with the Belfast Telegraph, Ulster Unionist party leader James Molyneaux offered to meet loyalist paramilitary leaders if they needed reassurance about Northern Ireland's constitutional position. The three Northern Ireland MEPs - Mr John Hume, the leader of the nationalist SDLP, Mr John Nicholson of the Ulster Unionist party and the Rev Ian Paisley of the hardline Democratic Unionist party - are to meet EU Commission president Jacques Delors today.

The idea that the government should open a 'reversible' dialogue with Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, will be considered by Mr John Major and cabinet colleagues next week. Ministers accept that in spite of worrying comments in recent days by senior Sinn Fein officials and of evidence that the IRA is maintaining its military capability, the signs are that the republicans intend the ceasefire to be permanent. A staged response - perhaps involving first the lifting of the exclusion orders on prominent Sinn Fein members and the re-opening of indirect contacts - would allow the government to be seen to be responding positively while maintaining the option of withdrawing contacts. Such an approach would allow the government to test further Sinn Fein's commitment to a permanent peace by exploring whether the IRA was ready to give up its arms and ammunition. No decisions will be taken during this week's Conservative party conference but ministers are expected to consider a detailed assessment of the situation in the province on their return to Whitehall next week. The government faces a potentially hostile response to its Northern Ireland policy on Thursday when a number of party activists intend to press for the full integration of the province into the UK. But Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, hinted at the change of tack yesterday. He said that the government was still not satisfied that the IRA had halted violence permanently, before adding: 'If we are not satisfied at the moment, we do not know for sure that we will ever be.' Sir Patrick said in Belfast that there had been 'encouraging progress' but the government was fully justified in its caution. He rejected suggestions from Mr Peter Temple-Morris, the Conservative backbench MP, that Mr Major would accept the permanence of the ceasefire soon after this week's conference but did not rule out a more limited response.

He denied setting a deadline of  March 17 for a Sinn Fein response to the Downing Street peace  declaration. Both he and Mr. Major had made it clear the door  to peace would not be closed, said Mr. Reynolds.    ""We are not closing the door to peace, we are not going to  lock that door and throw away the key."" But he added: ""I do not  think the overwhelming support of the Irish people can be  ignored. This is a new opportunity, there is never going to be  a better offer on the table and I cannot see what justification  there would be for the continuation of violence or the taking of  one more innocent life.""    During their meeting at Downing Street on Saturday both  leaders agreed to resume the three-strand Northern Ireland talks  process.    Mr. Reynolds told Irish radio the talks would be based on  the  principles enshrined in the declaration. ""The new starting  point will be the peace declaration. That has not been clear up  to now, we finally agreed it on Saturday. We also agreed that  it is a three-stranded process and not an internal settlement as  some people were suggesting.""    Mr. Reynolds said it was helpful that Mr. Major had  reaffirmed his commitment to the declaration. ""It was important  that the British prime minister said it because I think there  were people who were suspecting that maybe the British  Government in some way or another were not behind the  declaration.""    Mr. Reynolds quashed hopes that the Sinn Fein annual  conference next weekend would deliver a response to the Downing  St. declaration, saying: ""I never expected that forum to be the  forum at which the response would be put together."" But he  hoped sufficient people would recognise that the road to peace  was ""a better road to choose to pursue their political  objectives rather than the road to violence which in the last 25  years has been carried on by paramilitaries on both sides.  There will be no military victories.""    Mr. Reynolds said: ""We want people to sit back, study  exactly  where they have come from, where they are at and which road has  the best chance of advancing the cause of nationalism. We  believe the peace process is the only road.""    Earlier, Mr. Reynolds told BBC Radio 4's The World This  Weekend that progress was likely within a month.    ""Saturday's meeting cleared the air and we have now agreed  on  the basis for the new talks, which is that the peace declaration  will form the basis for the resumption of talks. That will be  the new starting point,"" he said.    And Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew told the  same programme that no party, including the Rev. Ian Paisley's  hardline Democratic Unionists, could be allowed to veto progress  of the peace talks.    Meanwhile, Irish Deputy Premier Dick Spring called on the  IRA  and Sinn Fein to show ""leadership and courage"" and accept the  Downing Street peace declaration.    But speaking on BBC1's Breakfast With Frost programme he  conceded that the IRA and Sinn Fein might never respond to the  peace initiative.    John Hume, the SDLP [Social Democratic Labor Party] leader,  said he did not agree with the view that the Declaration was  unacceptable to Sinn Fein.    He told the London Weekend Television Walden programme: ""My  reading is that they are still giving it detailed study, which  is what I expected, given the nature of that organisation.    ""Their immediate reaction is suspicion and that is what I  expect. But they have not rejected the Declaration. They have  asked for clarification.""    Mr. Hume said that peace in Ireland was above party  politics. ""I am putting it above party politics myself in the  dialogue that I have been engaged in, so I would feel that what  the British Government should do now is to directly clarify to  them whatever they want clarified.""

They said there was no shred of  justification for continuing the killings in Ulster. Speaking  on the steps of Downing Street after a 90-minute discussion, the  two leaders warned they were not ""waiting around"" for Sinn Fein  to respond to last year's joint declaration.    Progress was being made on a framework document grounded in  the declaration and on talks with the constitutional parties --  and would proceed with or without Sinn Fein. Mr Major urged the  paramilitaries to end their campaign of violence.    He and Mr Reynolds shared ""a disappointment that the  violence  continues,"" both the IRA violence and the loyalist violence.  ""There is no shred of justification for it whatsoever.""    Mr Reynolds said: ""There is one message quite clear that we  want to give -- that is that neither paramilitary organisations  are going to gain anything or bolster their position by a  continuation of violence. ""It is quite clear that the next  logical step if the peace process is to be moved forward is to  have a cessation of violence. ""There is no single vestige of  justification for the loss of one single life on either side in  either community.""    If Sinn Fein wanted a couple of weeks for further debate  over  the joint declaration, then neither government minded. But, he  insisted, there must be an end to violence immediately.    Mr Major made clear there was no deadline for the IRA to  respond to the declaration, but emphasised the two governments  were not simply waiting around for Sinn Fein to reply. ""There  is no delay, there has been no delay and there will be no delay  in continuing discussions with the constitutional parties and  with the government of the Republic of Ireland on the framework  document we are producing,"" said Mr Major. ""A great deal of  progress has been made. There's more to be done but it is not  awaiting an answer from Sinn Fein.""    Mr Reynolds said: ""The two governments are not going to wait  around, are not waiting around, for any more prevarication on  either side to stop the violence. We continue with our own  business.""    Mr Major was questioned by reporters about Sinn Fein  president Gerry Adams's earlier comments in which he offered  what was interpreted by some as new hope for peace in Northern  Ireland.    Mr Major said: ""I see nothing new in what he had to say this  morning. ""What was quite striking was what he didn't say. He  made no indication that he was going to give up violence.""    Mr Adams indicated there would be a Sinn Fein response to  the  peace moves after the European elections on June 9.    ""I am quite convinced that what is going to come out of this  peace process is a peace settlement -- I am quite convinced  about it. It is a significant step.""    He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""It is part of one of  those steps which are required to advance the peace process. It  addresses some of the core issues and it dismisses some of the  other questions.""    The fact that the British government responded to Sinn  Fein's  list of questions about the declaration was ""very significant"".    Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring told a European  conference  in Paris today: ""The time for clarification and debate is over.  It is now time, once and for all, to stop the killing from  whatever quarter on the island of Ireland.    ""The people of Ireland will wait no longer.""    Mr Reynolds said later he hoped Sinn Fein's response to the  declaration ""will be genuine and positive, and that it will lead  to a permanent cessation of violence.    ""That is the only logical next step if the peace process is  to be moved forward. I do not want to see anybody killed in the  meantime on either side.""    He added: ""What is important is that the violence by both  sets of paramilitaries in Northern Ireland should be ended  immediately.""    Mr Reynolds said at the Irish Embassy in London that moves  planned by the British and Irish governments to re-establish an  inter-party negotiating process in Northern Ireland were being  maintained.    He and Mr Major would have a full-scale summit on their  peace  initiative in mid-July.    Meanwhile, Liberal Democrat Ulster spokesman Lord Holme  said:  ""It is urgent that the British government table proposals for  constitutional progress in Northern Ireland based on devolution,  power-sharing and a Bill of Rights.    ""If Sinn Fein want to renounce violence and join the talks  process, all well and good, but the onus is on the British  government to take the initiative in consultation with the Irish  government and the constitutional parties of Northern Ireland.""

0,FT934-2917 ,"FT934-2917 _AN-DLLALAACFT 931211   FT  11 DEC 93 / Major and Reynolds edge closer to Ulster peace deal      By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor      BRUSSELS   Mr John Major and Mr Albert Reynolds last night kept alive the prospect of a pre-Christmas peace initiative designed to persuade the IRA to end its 25-year campaign of violence in Northern Ireland. Despite an admission by the two leaders that their second meeting in a week had failed to surmount remaining obstacles to a joint declaration, they held out the possibility that such a statement could be finalised within the next fews days. Amid conflicting reports of their encounter at the European summit in Brussels, Mr Reynolds was said to have been angered by Mr Major's refusal to move further in the direction of acknowledging the aspirations for a united Ireland of the nationalist community in Ulster. The Irish prime minister was said also to be frustrated at Mr Major's apparent refusal to persuade Unionist leaders that the peace initiative offered no threat to their present status. But both leaders appeared ready to acknowledge that the cost of a breakdown in their negotiations might well be a resumption of uncontrolled violence in Northern Ireland. So in a public statement after their talks, Mr Major and Mr Reynolds said that further progress had been made and that they expected another meeting would be held before Christmas at which they could finalise the declaration. Senior British officials insisted it was still possible the statement could be agreed by Tuesday or Wednesday of next week. The British and Irish prime ministers want the statement to provide a springboard for an intensive round of negotiations on a permanent political settlement in Northern Ireland. More immediately, they hope it will coax the IRA into extending its traditional Christmas ceasefire into a permanent cessation of violence. But the two leaders have yet to find the precise language for the most sensitive passages in the document. They also remain uncertain that the first attempt since the 1985 Anglo - Irish agreement to balance the competing claims of Irish nationalism and Ulster unionism would be enough to restore peace. The joint statement issued after the talks said Mr Major and Mr Reynolds hoped 'to bring the process to a successful conclusion' in the next 10 days. With Mr Major anxious to secure an accord before parliament breaks on Friday for the Christmas recess, one high-ranking British official commented: 'I very much hope we get there. I cannot guarantee that we will get there.' He then added: 'There is still some way to go.' Officials will attempt to iron out the remaining differences during intensive contacts over the next few days, opening the possibility of a final summit in London next week. Anxious to reassure the Ulster Unionists, British officials said the declaration would underwrite its guarantee to the Protestant majority in Northern Ireland that there could be no change in the status of the province without their consent. Mr Major had also won assurances from Mr Reynolds of Dublin's commitment to drop its constitutional claim to Northern Ireland as part of a comprehensive settlement. But Mr Reynolds is determined those assurances to the Unionist majority must be balanced by public recognition of the legitimacy of the nationalist aspiration for a united Ireland.

Insurers have been hardest hit by the two IRA bombs in the City. Claims from the Baltic exchange bomb in April 1992 amounted to Pounds 300m, including about Pounds 100m for interruption to business. Claims from the Bishopsgate bomb, a year later, totalled Pounds 500m, with about Pounds 150m for business interruption. Losses from other smaller bombs amount to less than Pounds 10m, said Mr Tony Baker, deputy director-general of the Association of British Insurers. In Northern Ireland the government has paid more than Pounds 620m since the late 1960s to compensate property owners for damage. Losses rose to Pounds 50m in 1976-77 before falling steadily to Pounds 15m in 1986-87, but the bill in 1991-92 was Pounds 33m. After the London bombs, insurers withdrew cover for terrorism from standard commercial policies. It is offered as a separate policy, with insurance companies covering their own exposures through Pool Re, a company owned by the insurance industry and backed by the government. The decision by Pool Re to charge more to businesses in central London and other areas judged to be terrorist targets than those in less vulnerable areas caused considerable controversy. Mr Baker said these problems had been overcome by insurers reducing some expensive premiums in return for the installation or adoption of security precautions. Mr Baker said changes were not likely for at least a year. Mr Baker argued for the maintenance of security, such as the restrictions of traffic in the City, and said there had to be a degree of caution.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

0,FT924-13338 ,"FT924-13338 _AN-CJPBWAAQFT 921016   FT  16 OCT 92 / The Birmingham Summit: Irish twist beggars Major in Europe's poorhouse      By DAVID GARDNER      BRUSSELS   AS IF John Major's government did not have enough grief: monetary policy in ruins, no sign of an economic strategy, and trying to place Britain at the heart of a Europe in danger of cardiac arrest. Now it is being suggested that the UK - post-devaluation - is technically poor enough to apply for extra European Community cash from the Cohesion Fund. This was agreed at Maastricht for Spain, Ireland, Portugal and Greece - the treaty says handouts are applicable to EC member states whose per capita income is below 90 per cent of the EC average. Mr John Hume, leader of Northern Ireland's Social Democratic and Labour Party, yesterday wrote to Mr Major (with copy to the European Commission president, Mr Jacques Delors), pointing out that UK per capita income at the purchasing power parities of today's rate for sterling is at 87 per cent of the EC average. Bingo. Ergo, could we have some of this Cohesion Fund - which Brussels wants to endow with Ecu10bn (Pounds 7.8bn) in today's money - for Northern Ireland please? Mr Hume could not resist being a bit more mischievous. Under EC regional policy rules, the purchasing power parity formula was used to make sure that Northern Ireland is defined as among the most backward regions in Europe, so it can get the most generous EC regional aid grants, even though average income is higher than the qualifying threshold. This deal has already had some highly charged political implications. Last year the EC formed a free trade zone with the seven rich Nordic and Alpine countries of the European Free Trade Association. The treaty in question, the European Economic Area, requires the new partners to help backward areas of the Community catch up, and defined Ireland, both north and south, as one unit: 'The island of Ireland', equally eligible for such hand-outs. Mr Hume reminds Mr Major of this precedent, saying 'access to the Cohesion Fund would underpin the proper planning of an integrated environmental and transport infrastructure on the basis of the needs of the island of Ireland'. Should Mr Major choose to take up the opportunity offered by the UK's relegation, his alternatives are not appealing. The Cohesion Fund applies to countries, not regions, so he would have to acknowledge that the UK as a whole is in Europe's poorhouse. Or he could say that Northern Ireland should be treated - economically at least - as part of Ireland.  The Financial Times   London Page 3  "

Up to 30,000 people participated in the biggest demonstration, in Belfast. Thousands more attended 11 rallies held in other towns. The event was organised by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in response to a perceived groundswell in the community in favour of a fresh effort at reconciliation. The Confederation of British Industry encouraged companies to allow employees to attend demonstrations. A 'vote for peace' telephone line received more than 100,000 calls. In Dublin Mr Albert Reynolds, the prime minister, led members of the Dail in observing the minute's silence.

0,FT934-16245 ,"FT934-16245 _AN-DJGCLADLFT 931007   FT  07 OCT 93 / Leading Article: Irish manoeuvres      MR John Hume, leader of the SDLP   the non-violent part of the nationalist movement in Northern Ireland - visits Dublin today to give the Irish government a full account of the bilateral talks he has been holding since April with Mr Gerry Adams of Sinn Fein (which represents the violent part), as well as a reaction from Washington where he has been sounding out his friends in the US Congress. The announcement 10 days ago that these talks had reached some kind of conclusion worth reporting to the Irish government has reawakened public interest in that most elusive of political goals, a peaceful settlement of the Northern Irish conflict. The precise content of the report remains private, but its purpose is clear: to devise a political process which would lead to the abandonment by the IRA of their armed struggle, and thereby to bring both strands of nationalism to the negotiating table. Almost simultaneously, it became known the British and Irish governments were jointly drafting a constitutional settlement, to present this to the parties in the province before the end of the year, in which the Irish government would indicate a willingness to modify its constitutional claim to jurisdiction over Northern Ireland to an 'aspiration'. To what extent the two events are linked is unclear, but the sudden publicity given to the second may well have resulted from anxiety in London to minimise the potential fall-out from the first. The British government has enough difficulty fending off the intense suspicion felt by Ulster Unionists about its contacts with Dublin. It knows that that suspicion is liable to become quite unmanageable if it appears at the same time to be negotiating, even indirectly, with the IRA. Intense sensitivities Sir Patrick Mayhew, Britain's Northern Ireland secretary, hurriedly confirmed there would be 'no change whatever' in the province's constitutional status without the consent of its people. But he has neither condemned Mr Hume's talks with Sinn Fein, nor ruled out considering their outcome. If these events signify that a peaceful settlement may indeed be moving, however tentatively, within reach, they also highlight the intense sensitivities on all sides to any perceived deviation from established political traditions in dealing with the Northern Ireland issue. The Irish government, under pressure from Britain to alter articles two and three of the republic's constitution (those which lay claim to sovereignty over the whole island), can only do this by referendum, but fears a rebuff from the electorate if a change on such a delicate issue is not part of 'an overall and balanced settlement'. The premature disclosure of the latest Anglo-Irish talks could increase this risk, by making it sound as though Dublin is covertly plotting a deal in which the republic would be expected to give something for nothing. Ringing endorsements Dublin's anger and embarrassment at the disclosure is to be expected and perhaps explains the ringing endorsements of Mr Hume by no less than four Irish cabinet ministers including the Taoiseach, Mr Albert Reynolds, himself. Mr Reynolds has asked the Unionists 'to suspend judgment' on the Hume-Adams talks until it becomes clear what the substance of their joint proposals is. The Unionists are unlikely to hold their breath for long however, especially if the IRA continues with its bomb outrages, as it has done over the past week. Until there is, at least, an effective ceasefire, the idea of Mr Reynolds and Mr Hume considering peace proposals from Sinn Fein will simply reinforce the Unionist belief that all nationalists are the same under the skin, whatever their public statements about violence. The Irish government, too, has it in its power to improve the atmosphere. It could do so by admitting publicly what many Irish politicians will say in private, namely that far from aspiring, let alone claiming, to govern the north, they regard any such prospect with trepidation. A statement to that effect would both give a clearer lead to public opinion in the republic - most of which would probably be more relieved than angered - and offer much-needed reassurance to the anxious majority in the north.

IRELAND;    ULSTER: BERNADETTTE DEVLIN MCALISKEY SAYS THAT IF WALLS CAN COME DOWN IN  GERMANY, WHY NOT IN IRELAND?      By BILL KENKELEN, PACIFIC NEWS SERVICE      Bernadette Devlin McAliskey, the 1960's firebrand defender of Catholic rights  in Northern Ireland, is visiting several American cities in coming weeks. Her  return to the United States after several years marks the rekindling of  interest in Northern Ireland politics among Irish-Americans.    The eloquent Devlin is likely to strike a responsive note -- in a way no other  Irish activist can -- among the faithful, who number in the tens of millions of  Americans.    ""People come out for Bernadette and get working in Irish issues who won't come  out for anyone else,"" says Sean Prendiville, a San Francisco Irish-American  activist. ""She inspires people because of all that she has been through.""    Devlin's political resume is dramatic. Elected to the British Parliament at 21  -- the youngest member since William Pitt in 1781 -- her maiden speech  mesmerized a normally raucous House of Commons. She was dragged from the House  floor after punching Britain's home secretary, who had barred her from speaking  about a 1972 massacre of Irish civilians by British troops. While a member of  Parliament, she served four months in prison for inciting a riot.    Devlin's activism ended abruptly in 1981 when she and her husband were shot by  members of a Protestant paramilitary group at their farmhouse near Belfast.  After a long recovery, she now leads the newly formed Irish National Congress,  which sponsors reconciliation projects between Catholics and Protestants and  lobbies for steps that may prompt eventual reunification of the island.    In a telephone interview, Devlin, 42, said the changes in Eastern Europe have  spawned optimism for changes in Ireland. ""The fervor for democracy and the  rights of small nations that have been trampled on permeates Ireland despite  (British Prime Minister) Margaret Thatcher,"" Devlin said.    Ironically, Devlin noted, while ""everybody's talking about it,"" the comparison  of radical change in Eastern Europe with the Irish situation cannot be made in  the British press because of censorship laws.    That comparison is also being made in America. Susan Murray, an Irish-American  activist who arranged a speaking engagement for McAliskey at Harvard University  on April 5, says there is ""a lot of excitement and cautious optimism about  Ireland now because walls are coming down everywhere else. If it can happen in  Germany, why not in Ireland?""    Devlin will visit Boston, San Francisco and Los Angeles, three hotbeds of  Irish-American activism. That activism, she said, has provided ""a major  contribution"" in focusing attention on British human rights abuses and helping  to curb Catholic unemployment in Northern Ireland.    She praised the MacBride principles as particularly helpful. The principles,  the focus of Irish-American activism in recent years, are in effect in 14  states and 24 U.S. cities. Under the guidelines, funds controlled by the state  or municipal governments are barred from being invested in companies that  practice employment discrimination in Northern Ireland.    High unemployment among the Catholic minority -- as much as 70% in some  Catholic neighborhoods -- has been one of the primary causes of the ""troubles""  that have led to thousands of violent deaths in the last 20 years.    Devlin's U.S. visit comes at a time when there is renewed interest in Irish  politics and culture among Irish-Americans. Tom Hansen, a member of the Ancient  Order of Hibernians in Los Angeles, says new Irish immigrants -- as many as  200,000 in the last 10 years -- and ""popular culture"" are inspiring new  generations of younger Irish-Americans. He cites the songs of such pop groups  as Stiff Little Fingers, Boomtown Rats and U2, and the growth of Irish-American  clubs like the Ancient Order, which has grown from two to seven chapters in the  Los Angeles area in the last few years.    In San Francisco, the Ulster Gaelic Club is a new organization made up of  recent immigrants and younger second- and third-generation Irish-Americans.  They focus on rugby and Irish politics.    Historically, Irish-Americans have played a key role in Irish politics --  providing money and manpower for the Irish Rebellion in 1916 that led to a free  Irish Republic. The first prime minister of the new republic was born in  Brooklyn, N.Y.    Despite the high-profile arrests of Irish-Americans in recent years for  gunrunning to the Irish Republican Army (IRA) in northern Ireland, such  incidents are not typical of the Irish-American political scene. Devlin herself  is not associated with the IRA.    Irish-American activism mainly involves protests against British measures to  contain the violence in Northern Ireland -- including internment without trial,  suspension of habeas corpus, and prohibitions against media reporting of  anti-British views. Another goal is to allow opponents of British policies to  speak in the United States.      Photo, Bernadette Devlin stands amid debris in the Bogside area of Londonderry,  Northern Ireland, in 1969.

Devlin's U.S. visit comes at a time when there is renewed interest in Irish  politics and culture among Irish-Americans. Tom Hansen, a member of the Ancient  Order of Hibernians in Los Angeles, says new Irish immigrants -- as many as  200,000 in the last 10 years -- and ""popular culture"" are inspiring new  generations of younger Irish-Americans. He cites the songs of such pop groups  as Stiff Little Fingers, Boomtown Rats and U2, and the growth of Irish-American  clubs like the Ancient Order, which has grown from two to seven chapters in the  Los Angeles area in the last few years.    In San Francisco, the Ulster Gaelic Club is a new organization made up of  recent immigrants and younger second- and third-generation Irish-Americans.  They focus on rugby and Irish politics.    Historically, Irish-Americans have played a key role in Irish politics --  providing money and manpower for the Irish Rebellion in 1916 that led to a free  Irish Republic. The first prime minister of the new republic was born in  Brooklyn, N.Y.    Despite the high-profile arrests of Irish-Americans in recent years for  gunrunning to the Irish Republican Army (IRA) in northern Ireland, such  incidents are not typical of the Irish-American political scene. Devlin herself  is not associated with the IRA.    Irish-American activism mainly involves protests against British measures to  contain the violence in Northern Ireland -- including internment without trial,  suspension of habeas corpus, and prohibitions against media reporting of  anti-British views. Another goal is to allow opponents of British policies to  speak in the United States.      Photo, Bernadette Devlin stands amid debris in the Bogside area of Londonderry,  Northern Ireland, in 1969.

Mr Peter Brooke, the Northern Ireland secretary, was due to chair the first inter-party session in Belfast today but it was unclear last night if the outstanding differences would be resolved in time. Discussions were continuing to try to end the disagreement over the venue for the second series of talks, during which Irish ministers and local politicians will discuss relationships between the Republic of Ireland and a new administration in the province. Unionists prefer London for the talks while nationalists favour a location 'somewhere in Ireland'. However, the indications are that both sides will accept a neutral venue, possibly the headquarters of the European parliament at Strasbourg. Members of the various political teams who will be at the talks were gearing up for a start later today. The Northern Ireland Office was making no official statement on the last-minute hitch, saying only that the process was still at the bilateral stage. Mr Brooke is expected to speak with the various party leaders this morning. If there are no further obstacles, the first formal inter-party talks for more than 15 years will later get under way.

He made his pledge as the Government faced calls to  withdraw the offer to the terrorists following two attacks on  Heathrow Airport.    Mr Hurd insisted that the Downing Street declaration still  stood, but accused the IRA of ""devious dishonesty"" in claiming  that it wanted clarification of the document.    The latest mortar attack, just after midnight this morning,  came after Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams warned of more  ""spectacular"" strikes to remind the world of the Republican  cause.    Mr Hurd said: ""The Downing Street declaration isn't a  bargaining document. It is a statement of the two governments,  the British and Irish governments, that the future of Northern  Ireland is going to be settled by consent, by the wishes of the  people who live there, and that everyone can take part in that  process -- except those who are practising violence. That is  clear enough and that stands.""    Mr Hurd attacked the IRA, saying: ""These are people who  claim  to be asking for clarifications of this document about democracy  and in fact they are scaring and killing people. I hope the  devious dishonesty of that is clear to everyone everywhere who  might have been taken in in the past.""    Northern Ireland's problems could not be solved by violence  and the people of Ireland no longer had any sympathy for  settling them through aggression, he told the BBC Radio 4 Today  programme.    Earlier politicians from all sides condemned the overnight  mortar bomb attack on Heathrow Airport -- the second in as many  days -- and urged a cooler approach to the IRA.    Seamus Mallon, Social Democratic and Labour Party MP for  Newry and Armagh, warned that the IRA was sending a clear  message that it was prepared to continue its campaign of  violence.    It was clear that the IRA was ""intent on pursuing their  objectives through this type of very vicious cynical attacks on  not just personnel at Heathrow but on personnel in Northern  Ireland,"" he told the programme. ""I believe there is a section  within the IRA who simply are not going to stop.""    Wolverhampton South West Tory MP Nick Budgen said the  Government should not invite the IRA to join the peace talks,  adding: ""The IRA ought to be treated as criminals and not as  people who have a legitimate right to negotiate about the  constitutional arrangements in Northern Ireland.""    Lord Holme, Liberal Democrat spokesman on Ulster, also  denounced Gerry Adams's ""callous"" warning of more spectaculars,  saying: ""Wherever the road to peace leads it doesn't lead  through the IRA.""    Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew last night  condemned Mr Adams. His comment came after the Sinn Fein leader  warned of more attacks by saying: ""The conflict is ongoing.  Every so often there will be something spectacular to remind  the outside world.""    Sir Patrick said in London last night: ""I deeply resent and  reject the tone and content of what he is reported to have said.""    He told a meeting of the European Atlantic Group: ""The  gloating character of that observation seems to me to be quite  despicable and a remark of profound cynicism.""     "

In a toughly worded interview Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, ruled out a unionist veto on constitutional change, and demanded British action to 'persuade' unionists to accept Irish unity. Mr Adams told The Observer newspaper that 'the unionists will not move, and we cannot expect them to move, until the British persuade them to. They have no right of a veto over any policy'. His comments suggest a hardening of the Sinn Fein response to the Anglo-Irish joint declaration on Northern Ireland, which gives the unionists an explicit veto on constitutional change. However, Mr Adams also acknowledged that a united Ireland could not be achieved without the participation of the unionist majority in Northern Ireland. In a separate statement issued in Belfast, Mr Adams repeated demands for 'clarification' of the joint declaration, which offers Sinn Fein a place at the negotiating table within three months of a permanent IRA ceasefire. The statement said Mr Major's refusal to clarify the declaration was 'an abdication of his responsibilities and a clear indication that he has no real commitment to building the peace process'. It said Sinn Fein was prepared to 'assist' Mr Major to bring about peace. 'The sooner he stops play-acting and stringing this out, the sooner we can all move towards an end to conflict and towards a new beginning.' Downing Street said a letter setting out Sinn Fein's request for clarification had not been received. But Mr Major made clear that no clarification would be offered. Mr Major told Sir David Frost on BBC Television that he was prepared to wait 'for a little while' for a definitive republican response to the joint declaration. But he said the government would not be 'drawn into negotiations by the back door' by responding to questions from Sinn Fein in advance of a permanent IRA ceasefire. 'What at present is going on is that they are seeking to muddy (the) issue, to enter into negotiations effectively without giving up violence,' he said. 'That is not on offer. They do have to give up violence and then the way forward to a democratic future is perfectly clear, and the way forward for them to get into the talks about the democratic future for Northern Ireland is perfectly clear.' Mr Major said the three-stranded talks process between London, Dublin and Belfast, which began in 1992, would be intensified whatever Sinn Fein's response to the joint declaration.

0,FT942-1360 ,"FT942-1360 _AN-EFXC1AEAFT 940624   FT  24 JUN 94 / London and Dublin close to framework Ulster deal      By PHILIP STEPHENS and TIM COONE      CORFU, DUBLIN   Mr John Major and Mr Albert Reynolds were on course last night to agree the framework for a comprehensive political settlement in Northern Ireland by mid-July . As the British and Irish prime ministers prepared for bilateral talks at the European Union summit in Corfu, senior Whitehall officials voiced confidence that they could clear the remaining roadblocks to the agreement before next month's Anglo-Irish summit. There are continuing differences over repeal of Dublin's constitutional claim to Ulster and over the shape and authority of proposed joint boards to enhance cross-border co-operation. However the officials said Mr Major was determined to find a formula to bridge the remaining differences over the 'constitutional balance' of the accord. The escalation of sectarian violence in the province - underlined by last week's murder of six Catholic men in their local bar  - has added further impetus to the search for an accord. Once agreed, the framework document - covering relations between London and Dublin, cross-border co-operation and outline plans for a new assembly in Northern Ireland - will be presented as the basis for renewed talks between the constitutional parties. It is understood that Britain has rejected any suggestion that new north-south institutions could imply 'joint authority' over the province. The Ulster Unionists, whose co-operation is a prerequisite to an eventual settlement, are determined that the Dublin government is not given constitutional authority in the administration of Ulster. But Mr Major is prepared to see cross-border executive boards to oversee a common approach in areas such as transport, energy, agriculture and tourism. The creation of such boards - whose powers would be decided in consultation with the constitutional parties - would acknowledge the two governments had a 'shared interest' in the economic development of the province. The Irish foreign ministry wishes the boards to have 'executive powers', embracing the main areas of mutual economic concern to the two parts of the island. For his part, Mr Reynolds is arguing that a commitment by the Dublin government to amend or repeal articles two and three of the Irish constitution - which encapsulate the republic's territorial claim to Northern Ireland - must be contingent on an overall political settlement acceptable to nationalists as well as unionists in Ulster.

Mr Robert Atkins, minister for the economy and the environment in Northern Ireland, announced in Belfast that company's 165m shares would be offered at 220p each. This represents a historic gross dividend yield of 5.8 per cent based on net dividends for the 1992-93 year of Pounds 16.5m, or 10.02p per share. All the company's shares are being offered for sale except for a small proportion for bonus entitlements and employees. Payment for the shares will be in two instalments, the first 100p payable on application and the rest on June 28 1994. The offer, with a 100-share minimum, closes June 16. Incentives are being offered for pre-registered applicants who hold on to their shares for a given period. The offer has attracted more than 800,000 registrations. COMMENT The offer price lay at the mid-point of market expectations and was viewed in the City as providing an attractive investment opportunity. The historic yield of 5.8 per cent compares with an average in the regional electricity company sector of 5.1 per cent, pointing to a possible gain of between 10p and 15p when the shares begin trading on June 21. Analysts were calculating a prospective yield of well above 6 per cent.

Mr Reynolds was clearly disappointed at the decision of the British ambassador Mr David Blatherwick not to attend on the opening day. Downing Street said the ambassador declined because of the presence of Sinn Fein, with which London has not entered into exploratory talks. Mr Gerry Adams, leader of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, described the British move as petty: 'It's an indication of the British attitude not just to the peace process, but also to the Irish government.' In another remark unlikely to comfort London, Mr Reynolds appeared to link the issue of the 'disposal of arms' with a British decision to withdraw 'troops to barracks'. The forum gathering in Dublin Castle comprised leaders of the constitutional parties of the south, together with Sinn Fein, the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party and the non-sectarian Alliance party of Northern Ireland. Mr Reynolds said the forum would 'establish for the first time . . . some measure of agreement on future structures governing relationships within Northern Ireland, between north and south and between Ireland and Britain'. This referred to the three strands of the Anglo-Irish talks. Mr Reynolds also held out the prospect of a debate on constitutional change, as foreshadowed in the Downing Street declaration.

Mr Adams -- granted a visa by President Bill Clinton after a  20-year ban on entering the U.S. because of alleged terrorism  links -- re-stated his peace message in a breakfast-time  coast-to-coast television interview.    ""My aim is to see an end to violence,"" the leader of the  IRA's political wing told the Good Morning America programme.    ""But there are no simple solutions to the position in  Northern Ireland. We are at a very critical phase at the moment.    ""What we want to do is to remove the gun permanently from  Irish politics, to develop a process in my country which allows  the people of Ireland and Britain to live in harmony, which  allows the Irish people -- all of us, unionist, nationalist,  catholic, protestant, dissenters -- to shape out a future which  reflects all of our own interests.""    As Mr Adams was speaking terrorist activity continued in  Northern Ireland.    The IRA mounted a mortar bomb attack on troops at a major  checkpoint on the main Belfast-Dublin Road outside Newry, Co  Down.    Earlier, in Portadown, County Armagh, a Royal Ulster  Constabulary officer was slightly hurt when he walked into a  loyalist bomb trap intended for a Catholic family.    Mr Adams, whose visit to New York to address a high-powered  conference on Northern Ireland is being given blanket coverage  by the U.S. media, insisted when asked his view of the Downing  Street Peace Declaration signed by Prime Minister John Major and  Irish premier Albert Reynolds: ""I am committed to taking  everything in a positive way.""    There was, he said, ""no evidence at all"" of a split within  the republican movement, the IRA or Sinn Fein, on a response to  the peace statement from the two premiers.    ""Republicans want peace and want to move forward,"" he said.  ""We are committed to struggling for as long as it takes, but  this conflict in Ireland could be over, providing the British  co-operated in a process to end it.""    Mr Adams gave the TV interview from his room in the plush  Waldorf-Astoria hotel in New York's Manhattan district.    The hotel will be the venue for today's Northern Ireland  Conference, organised by the influential National Committee of  American Foreign Policy.    Ulster unionist leaders have refused to take part in the  debates because of the Sinn Fein presence, but Social Democratic  and Labour Party leader John Hume and Dr John Alderdice of the  Alliance Party will be there.    Mr Adams said the conference was ""a unique opportunity to  break the stalemate"" and added: ""I have commended President  Clinton for giving me permission to come here.""    When the interviewer asked Mr Adams whether he was or had  been a ""high-ranking IRA commander,"" the Sinn Fein chief  replied: ""That is not true at all.    ""I am in a situation where in my own country I have been  shot. I have been imprisoned without trial on a number of  occasions. The only time I ever had a charge against me was for  trying to escape from that imprisonment.    ""I was charged with IRA membership and the Lord Chief  Justice  threw it out of court.""    Adams, who failed in eight previous applications for visas  to  enter the U.S., dominated the front page of New York's tabloid  DAILY NEWS newspaper.    THE NEW YORK TIMES also put the Adams visit on the front  page, and called the Sinn Fein man ""an articulate IRA advocate.""     "
0,FT944-4839 ,"FT944-4839 _AN-ELGCWAALFT 941207   FT  07 DEC 94 / Ireland poised for election as talks on coalition collapse      By JOHN MURRAY BROWN, Ireland Correspondent   Ireland was last night heading for an early general election after talks on the formation of a new coalition broke down. The impasse came amid fresh allegations about outgoing prime minister Albert Reynolds' controversial handling of a judicial appointment. Mr Dick Spring, the Irish Labour party leader, abandoned negotiations with Fianna Fail, the largest party, hours before yesterday's scheduled session of the Dail, which would have approved the formation of a new government. Last night Labour was trying to forge a left-right coalition with the main opposition party, Fine Gael, and one of the smaller parties in the hope of avoiding an election. However, MPs held out little hope for such a pact. If a coalition does not emerge in the next few days, Mr Reynolds will be forced to dissolve parliament and call an election. Mr Spring appealed to all parties to solve the crisis quickly because of its likely effect on the Northern Ireland peace process. 'A prolonged period of instability that could result from an election would do potential damage to the progress towards peace and reconciliation in Ireland,' he told parliament. The collapse of talks between Labour and Fianna Fail comes at a critical moment in the peace process, three days before the UK government starts exploratory talks with Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing. Speaking in Belfast, Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, seemed keen to play down the crisis. However, he conceded that the delays would create a 'hiatus' in the negotiations to devise a framework document which the two governments hope will form the basis for talks on a constitutional settlement for Ulster. The judicial row that led to the collapse of the Irish government centres on Mr Harry Whelehan, the former attorney-general. Mr Whelehan allegedly failed to process UK extradition warrants for a paedophile Roman Catholic priest who was later convicted of child abuse offences in Northern Ireland. Mr Reynolds reiterated in parliament that he had not tried to mislead parliament over the affair. But the Irish Times newspaper reported on Monday that the prime minister had deliberately deceived parliament by not disclosing his attempt to persuade Mr Whelehan to resign as attorney-general a day before publicly defending him in parliament. On Monday, Mr Spring demanded that Mr Eoghan Fitzsimons, the new attorney-general, provide a written explanation of the sequence of events. Mr Reynolds hurried back from the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe summit in Budapest to answer parliamentary questions. 'We are not happy with the answers we got . . . We've broken off negotiations with Fianna Fail at this stage,' Mr Spring said as he left the Dail yesterday. 'It's very serious,' said Mr Bertie Ahern, the new leader of Fianna Fail. 'We were hoping we'd form a government. That's not going to be the case.' Mr Ahern seemed visibly shaken by the new set of allegations. He said the party was resigned to a period in opposition or a general election. 'We're living through one of the saddest episodes in our parliamentary history,' said Ms Mary Harney, leader of the Progressive Democrats, a former coalition partner.

The general perception had been of a two-to-one split in favour of the Protestants among the 1.5m population - but the census, taken in April 1991, shows a difference of only 4.4 per cent. A total of 38.4 per cent recorded themselves as Roman Catholic and 42.8 per cent said they belonged to the Protestant church - 21.3 per cent Presbyterian, 17.7 per cent Church of Ireland and 3.8 per cent Methodist. Other religious groupings, including the Jewish, Chinese and Indian communities, represent 7.8 per cent of the total population. A further 3.8 per cent recorded themselves as having no religion and 7.3 per cent did not respond to the voluntary question on the census form. The findings are thought to provide the most accurate snapshot of life in Northern Ireland for 20 years. The 1981 census was distorted because many Roman Catholics did not fill in forms at a time of tension during the IRA Maze prison hunger strike. The census shows there are now more pensioners.

His expectations were to be cruelly dashed. New revelations about his role in the unfolding judicial scandal that destroyed his government last month forced him to cut short his trip and rush back for yesterday's vital session of the Dail, the Irish parliament. With Mr Dick Spring, Labour leader, yesterday calling off his negotiations with Fianna Fail, it is widely believed that a general election is the only way out of the impasse. Mr Bertie Ahern, who succeeded as leader of Fianna Fail after Mr Reynolds was forced to resign as prime minister, publicly accepted that a fresh alliance with Labour was no longer an option. The latest breakdown follows allegations that Mr Reynolds misled parliament over the appointment of Mr Harry Whelehan from attorney-general to the post of president of Irish High Court. It emerged on Monday that a day after defending Mr Whelehan Mr Reynolds had tried to persuade him to resign. As the Dail prepared for yesterday's critical session, the mood was summed up by one Labour MP: 'Its lies, lies and damned lies.' The public mood is one of almost total shock. Ireland has already spent a month agonising over the role of the Catholic Church, its most hallowed institution, after the first allegations about bungled extradition of a paedophile priest, later convicted in Northern Ireland on child sex abuse charges. This has been followed by a political crisis which a nervous public fear may undermine efforts to achieve an elusive peace in Northern Ireland. There is little public enthusiasm for a general election whose campaign could take the country right into Christmas week. Only two days ago the three-week-old political crisis seemed close to a resolution. A new coalition between Fianna Fail and Labour seemed a foregone conclusion. The programme, inherited from the outgoing government, looked to be agreed. Both parties appeared committed to a high-growth strategy and to reducing the level of indebtedness. Fianna Fail and Labour seemed prepared to co-operate to co-ordinate policy on Northern Ireland. But now all this is to the hazard. The most immediate concern is that the crisis may hurt or slow down the Northern Ireland peace process. Dublin and London have yet to finalise the long-awaited framework document which is expected to form the basis for all-party talks on a new constitution for the province. It is also just a few days away from the first public meeting between UK officials and Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing. Efforts to avoid a Christmas poll continued yesterday. Mr Spring announced he was restarting talks with Fine Gael, the main opposition party. With Labour holding 32 seats and Fine Gael 47, there is an arithmetical possibility of a coalition with one of the smaller parties. Mr John Bruton, the Fine Gael leader, said yesterday that 'first of all we must get full facts out on the floor of the Dail'. With stronger leadership from Fine Gael, it is clear that the party could win broad support within parliament to lead a coalition with Labour. However, relations between Mr Spring and Fine Gael are not good, and a new accommodation may prove difficult in practice. The smartest political punters in Dublin appear to be laying their bets on a Christmas election.   Countries:-  IEZ  Ireland, EC.   Industries:-  P9199 General Government, NEC.

The recommendations form part of a 400-page report prepared by the commission, which is chaired by Professor Torkel Opsahl, an international human rights lawyer and United Nations adviser. Other commissioners include Mr Eamonn Gallagher, the former EC director-general of fisheries, and Lady Faulkener of Downpatrick, a former BBC governor for Northern Ireland whose husband, Brian, was the last Stormont prime minister. The report recommends that a 'government of Northern Ireland should be put in place, based on the principle that each community has an equal voice in making and executing the laws or a veto on their execution, and equally shares administrative authority'. But the proposal received a cool response from both sides of Ulster's political divide. The Reverend Ian Paisley, leader of the hardline Democratic Unionist Party, which has boycotted the inquiry, described power sharing as a 'blueprint for the destruction of the union'. Sinn Fein said the report was 'ambiguous'. Mr John Hume, leader of the mainly nationalist Social Democratic Labour Party, said he wanted time to study the report in depth. The commission has avoided elaborating the precise form power sharing should take. The report says, however, that new legislation should be brought in to reinforce the rights of the minority Roman Catholic community. Prof Opsahl said the commission had wanted to avoid being seen to usurp the role of government or local politicians. Rather, it had set out to act as a channel for the views of ordinary citizens whose voices might not otherwise be heard. 'The publication of the report is perhaps the end of the beginning but we expect the discussion to go on.' he said. In its proposals on future government the commission rejects the conflicting positions taken by some local politicians - the unification in the short term of Ulster and the Irish Republic or the alternative of a full integration of the province into the United Kingdom. But the report is as critical of the government as of Ulster's political leadership in contributing to what it dubs a 'democratic deficit' in Northern Ireland. 'The British government's insistence that it is an honest broker, and that the ingredients of a settlement must be worked out between the two communities (Roman Catholic and Protestant) adds to the recipe for conflict.' The commission says that it found wide agreement among those giving oral evidence that a settlement excluding Sinn Fein would be 'neither lasting nor stable'. It insists that Sinn Fein should renounce violence before being allowed into full political talks, although it sees informal contacts with government as a useful way of exploring the prospects for an IRA ceasefire. The commissioners also want the government to lift its broadcasting ban on Sinn Fein. Among the other key recommendations in the report are the reform of the local police force and the strengthening of human rights with the enactment of a bill of rights.

The Pounds 157m Belfast factory for Hualon of Taiwan is the largest project ever handled by Northern Ireland's Industrial Development Board and would employ 2,000 workers to produce about 23,000 tonnes, of polyester-cotton fabric a year. The IDB yesterday welcomed the commission's decision and said it was optimistic that the project would proceed, although contracts had not yet been signed. Hualon is one of the Far East's leading textile manufacturers, with sales of Pounds 500m in 1992. Much of the output from the Belfast factory would be for downmarket garments, about 40 per cent of which are currently imported into Europe. The company argues that with many European producers having abandoned this market to switch to higher-quality products, the new factory would be substituting imports rather than displacing European producers. However, the BTC says there is 'no proof whatsoever' that Hualon will limit itself to low-cost products. 'The investment is vast and they are going to have to find a huge market for such gigantic volumes,' said Mr Wilson. He also disputed the number of jobs that will be created. 'Up to 2,000 jobs in an area of high unemployment is certainly a compelling case,' he said. 'But there has been no explanation of where these jobs will come from. We find Hualon's figures startling in that the factory will be highly capital intensive.'   Companies:-  Hualon Corp.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Although the dividend increase was slightly below what most analysts expect the regional electricity companies to pay on average in the current results round, the City approved of the company's success in tackling its cost base. Earnings per share for the six months to September 30 rose to 20.8p (17.9p). Turnover of Pounds 206.2m (Pounds 188.4m) was helped by tariff increases of 6.6 per cent and a 2 per cent increase in units distributed (weather corrected). Sir Desmond Lorimer, chairman, said Northern Ireland's economy had not experienced the booms and troughs that other UK areas had been through in recent years and he expected the economy to remain healthy in the second half of the year. NIE's sales will also be helped by current trends in prices of coal and oil which generate all of the province's electricity. Mr Patrick Haren, chief executive, said the company did not expect to experience the same kind of pressure for next year's prices as it did for this year's. The company's performance in the first half of the year was helped by a 7.3 per cent reduction in controllable operating costs. Mr Gordon Woodworth, finance director, said Pounds 2.6m, or 8 per cent, had been taken off salaries and employee related costs. The company reduced its payroll number from 3,413 in September 1992 to 3,157 this September and has set a target of 2,557 by March 1996. Appliance trading moved from a Pounds 300,000 loss to a Pounds 200,000 profit. COMMENT When NIE was floated six months ago, the fear was that the association of the region it serves with terrorism would cast a constant shadow over the shares. In the event the shares have considerably outperformed the market in spite of renewed political problems in Northern Ireland and they rose again yesterday by 15p to 226p on a partly paid basis. The attraction of NIE is that the external threats are minimal. Competition will take longer to bite than on the mainland and the regulator's review of the distribution is further away than that faced by the regional distribution companies for April 1995. The management has also played its part in vindicating the shares' outperformance by tackling costs more effectively than expected. They still have some work to do to improve customer service but this is a small downside. Assuming a dividend of 11.4 per cent, the shares are on a prospective yield of 4.1 per cent. That is near the bottom of the recs' range, leaving little scope for further outperformance. But there are few dangers for shareholders.   Companies:-  Northern Ireland Electricity.

In response to questions in the Commons, Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, appeared to harden the government's position that it would only look afresh at policy if there was a genuine end to violence. Sir Patrick yesterday said peace could only be secured if terrorists turned their backs on violence for ever and not just for a ceasefire. 'To secure the peace that everyone in Northern Ireland deserves . . . (needs) a declaration by the Provisional IRA and other terrorist groups that the perpetration of violence is over and over for good. It is not a question of a ceasefire and that of temporary relief.' Details of the peace initiative have not been published, but it is understood to envisage a cessation of violence as the start of talks on Ulster's constitutional status. Sir Patrick's comments were interpreted by some MPs as a signal that the government was further distancing itself from the peace initiative created by Mr John Hume of the Social Democratic and Labour party and Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA. The Ulster unionists, led by Mr James Molyneaux, have rejected the Hume-Adams proposals as 'sheer lunacy'. The government's small majority and the continued threat of revolt has increased its dependence on the Ulster unionists. This has fuelled speculation that ministers may soon agree to unionist demands for a select committee on Northern Ireland. Sir Patrick has said it is a matter for the Commons, but it would need government support. Sir Patrick also said that an immediate resumption of formal inter-party talks on the future of Ulster would be 'counter-productive'.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Speaking in Dublin to businessmen from both sides of the border, his comments were made in response to recent criticisms from Unionists in Northern Ireland that the current bilateral talks between the two governments are aimed at establishing a joint authority. Mr Spring said that a joint authority 'is not on the Irish government's agenda'. Deeper economic co-operation, however, would be encouraged. It would be 'realistic' to double current cross-border trade of IPounds 1.3bn (Pounds 1.28bn) a year to IPounds 3bn. In spite of deep political divisions 'there are very few who will contest the view that Ireland makes sense as a single economic area,' said Mr Spring. The Irish government wanted 'strong, meaningful and dynamic' cross-border structures to promote this goal and the two governments were looking at the prospects for co-operation in transport, health, energy, trade and tourism 'and other areas'. He said the continuing violence imposed a 'huge burden' on both the UK and Irish economies and impeded progress in economic co-operation. It was imperative 'that those who engage in violence on both sides should cease to inflict this intolerable burden on their fellow citizens'. Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, has meanwhile been pouring cold water on growing expectations of an extended IRA ceasefire in the summer or autumn. Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, said: 'The present intense speculation . . . is unhelpful and misinformed'. He added: 'Peace is not simply an IRA ceasefire. The peace process must address all of the issues which lie at the heart of the conflict.' These included a lifting of the broadcasting ban on Sinn Fein, an end to 'economic inequalities' for Roman Catholics and 'the speedy release' of all long-term IRA prisoners. Sinn Fein is due to give its definitive response to the Downing Street declaration within the next two to three weeks.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.     IEZ  Ireland, EC.

Mr Ron Brown, the US commerce secretary, is expected to address the conference, which is aimed at boosting the number of foreign companies investing in the province as part of the process of reviving its economy in the wake of IRA and Loyalist ceasefires. Tackling Northern Ireland's endemic high unemployment is seen as an important part of the peace process. The province's unemployment rate - 12.7 per cent - remains about 3 percentage points higher than the national average. Unemployment is particularly high among males in city centres such as Belfast and Derry. The Industrial Development Board for Northern Ireland says the province has enjoyed one of its best years for foreign investment. In the 12 months to March 1994 new investment totalled Pounds 505m, of which Pounds 260m was new foreign inward investment. The inward investment created 2,300 new jobs net. The investment figure for this year should be higher because of the controversial Hualon project from Taiwan. The IDB believes that the province's violent image has deterred potential investors. The conference will be told that a peaceful Northern Ireland holds considerable attractions for foreign investors - with a highly skilled workforce based on engineering industries and wage levels 16 per cent lower than those in mainland Britain. The IDB says land and property is considerably cheaper than in Great Britain. It is able to offer a package of incentives which can include 50 per cent of start-up costs. Mr John Hume, leader of the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party, is expected to receive a rapturous reception from the 600 delegates to the party's 24th annual conference over the weekend. His keynote speech is expected to cover the future of the peace process in the next 12 months. Opening the conference at Cookstown, Co Tyrone, yesterday, Mr Mark Dirkan, the party chairman, reiterated the SDLP demand for a dual referendum on both sides of the Irish border on any political agreement reached about the future of Northern Ireland.

0,FT931-916 ,"FT931-916 _AN-DC1AGABCFT 930327   FT  27 MAR 93 / Violent week culminates in fury: The growing public outrage over the violence on both sides of Northern Ireland's religious divide      By RALPH ATKINS, TIM COONE and Our Belfast Correspondent   THE DEEP revulsion felt over terrorism arising from the troubles in Northern Ireland erupted into fury yesterday after a grisly week of killings - leaving politicians floundering to address a fresh re-emergence of a 'something must be done' mentality. The burial of Johnathan Ball, the three-year-old boy killed in Warrington last weekend was a focus of anger - especially from Dublin. A peace rally at the city's central post office tomorrow will protest that the IRA is not acting in the name of Ireland. The site is intensely symbolic  -the location of the 1916 uprising against British rule. From the other side of Northern Ireland's religious and political divide six Roman Catholics have been killed in the province this week by loyalist terrorists. The public outrage is palpable but, after almost 25 years of the 'troubles', is far from unprecedented. Not for the first time either the words of statesmen on both sides of the Irish sea have failed to cover the political intransigence gripping the province. Bogged down by dispute between Unionists and Dublin over whether Ireland's constitutional claim on Ulster is up for negotiation, political talks are not expected to resume until after the local elections in the province on May 19. In the vacuum, terrorism has surged. Loyalist attacks in particular are seriously worrying security chiefs. The Ulster Freedom Fighters, the military wing of the now-banned Ulster Defence Association, is being run by a younger and more ruthless leadership. Ironically, the intelligence forces are less able to track many ringleaders following arrests made as a result of the 1990 Stevens inquiry into collusion between loyalist terrorists and the security forces. Sir Hugh Annesley, Royal Ulster Constabulary chief constable, says the threat from loyalist terrorists has never been greater. The new hard-line leadership has warned it will escalate its activities. Politicians are united in their anger. Mr John Major said the 'belief that these people are evil' was spreading. It was 'intolerable' that the wish of the majority to live peaceful lives should be frustrated 'by a tiny minority', said Mr Dick Spring, Irish foreign minister. But the unanimity quickly degenerates when solutions are addressed. Mr Peter Robinson, deputy leader of the hardline Democratic Unionist Party, insisted that 'the men of violence are immune to public outrage - and they are also immune to political settlement'. Many Unionists say tougher security - including internment without trial - is the only answer. Among nationalists, however, the priority is on addressing historical divisions - and there is a sense that the failure of formal political talks is a justification for individuals to talk to terrorists. Irish Senator Mr Gordon Wilson, whose daughter was murdered by the IRA at Enniskillen in 1987, is to meet IRA military chiefs and has received support from Mr Seamus Mallon, deputy leader of the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour Party. Mr Mallon has said the opening of such unofficial channels of communication should be encouraged to stop violence spiraling. The seemingly irreconcilable divisions only encourage support for the most radical of solutions - treating Northern Ireland like any other part of the UK or pushing for Irish unification. Neither Dublin nor London really believe either can work. Will anything result from this expression of popular mood? Mr Dick Spring is trying to woo Unionists, to address their concerns in the hope of re-starting talks. There might be a resumption in June or July. Mr Major takes a close interest in the work of the Northern Ireland Office. A year ago, after a still more ferocious episode of killing, he successfully kick-started political talks, only for them to collapse later that year. He is due soon to meet Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, under an agreement that the two should meet every six months. Maastricht, the domestic economy and coal pits have distracted his attention. Perhaps Northern Ireland will be higher on his agenda this weekend. The IRA said yesterday that one of the four Roman Catholic workmen shot dead by the outlawed Ulster Freedom Fighters, in the past 48 hours was one of its members. The terrorist group, which admitted the killings in of Castlerock, had claimed the man was the IRA leader in the Maghera area.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Mr Atkins said: 'The most important of these relates to the funding of the proposed interconnector to Scotland and an application which the government has made to the European Commission for assistance towards its costs. 'The government strongly supports the application and hopes for its success but recognises the need for the commission to undertake a thorough evaluation of it. Consequently, although one option for the flotation of Northern Ireland Electricity (NIE) was November 1992, it will not be possible to complete the sale this autumn. Once the outstanding matters have been resolved, the sale will take place as soon as possible, dependent on a suitable slot in the government's overall privatisation programme.' NIE and ScottishPower reached agreement on the Pounds 200m interconnector project earlier this year and it is thought the government is seeking about Pounds 70m from the commission towards the cost of construction. The first part of the sell-off took place in April when Ulster's four power stations went into private hands. British Gas bought the biggest station, Ballylumford near Larne, East Antrim; Nigen, an American-Belgian consortium, acquired Kilroot station, near Carrickfergus, East Antrim, and Belfast West station. A management-employee buy-out team bought the Coolkeeragh plant at Londonderry. The sales grossed about Pounds 300m for the Treasury. It had been anticipated that the transmission, distribution and supply business would be floated in November, raising a further Pounds 350m for the government. Advertisements have been running almost nightly on Ulster Television promoting the image of NIE, and the postponement has come as a shock.  The Financial Times   London Page 8  "

Speaking just hours before this week's 72-hour IRA ceasefire ended, Mr Michael Ancram said London would 'vigorously and wholeheartedly' support Northern Ireland's wish to remain in the union for as long as the greater number of the province's people so wished. He said the joint declaration's assertion that Britain had 'no selfish strategic or economic interest' in the province meant only that the government had no agenda of its own that would cause it to frustrate the population's wishes. His remarks to a meeting in Cambridge came as Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, attacked Mr John Major for his 'provocative and belligerent' tone during the ceasefire. Mr Adams said Mr Major's preoccupation with the survival of his government was a 'minus factor' in the peace process. But the significance of the IRA's gesture 'will not have been missed by the policy makers at Whitehall'. The Sinn Fein president, who earlier this week in effect discounted the chances of a ceasefire extension, hinted in Belfast there was a potential for some further initiative from the IRA at a later date, although he would not be specific about what that might be. Mr Ancram told the Friends of the Union there was at present 'no widespread support' for a joint authority in Northern Ireland. This was 'not something which . . . I expect to see emerging from any genuine process of dialogue leading to an agreed solution'. Meanwhile, Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, used a speech in Toronto to pledge that the government would persevere in its efforts to forge a lasting settlement.

Mr Major is understood to have talked to Mr Richard Ryder, chief whip, about the 'mood of the party' on the issue of Mr Mates's links with Mr Asil Nadir and on reports that the Conservatives received funding from companies associated with the fugitive businessman. With few Conservative backbenchers prepared to support Mr Mates in public or in private, the feeling was growing at Westminster that the minister's future may be settled when the powerful 1922 executive of Tory backbench MPs meets on Thursday, if it has not been settled before. Labour will use a full-length Commons debate on Tory finances today to keep the pressure on by claiming the revelations so far are just the tip of the iceberg. Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, said it was not enough simply to throw Mr Mates to the wolves. However, associates of the prime minister dismissed suggestions that Mr Mates had threatened to reveal damaging information about the collapse of Mr Nadir's Polly Peck empire. Mr Mates - who on several occasions passed to the attorney-general allegations that the UK security services had conspired against Mr Nadir - was said to accept now that the charges were without foundation. Sir Norman Fowler, the party chairman, tried last night to turn the attack on Labour, saying the real issue on party funding was Labour and the trade unions. 'We will return any money we have received which is proven to be stolen,' he said. 'Will Labour promise the same if the tens of thousands of pounds John Smith admits they received from Robert Maxwell prove to be stolen?' However, Sir Bernard Ingham, Lady Thatcher's former chief press officer, urged Mr Major to 'lance the boil' and sack Mr Mates. The Tory party should also pay back Mr Nadir's donations. Mr Mates was rebuked by Mr Major earlier this month after he admitted sending a watch to Mr Nadir bearing the inscription: 'Don't let the buggers get you down'. That inscription was said to reflect Mr Mates's initial concern that Mr Nadir's charges had some basis in truth. Mr Major, at the EC summit in Copenhagen, yesterday again refused to comment on the rising tide of speculation at Westminster that Mr Mates will soon quit. Mr Major's silence was seen as a signal that although reluctant to sack Mr Mates he will not resist his resignation. He was said to regard as a second 'mistake' Mr Mates's acceptance of the loan of a car from Mr Nadir's public relations advisers. Mr Mates did receive a vote of confidence from Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, who said his departmental colleague was 'doing an excellent job' and he 'very much' hoped he would continue to do it.

British ministers expect that two meetings under the Anglo-Irish conference might be necessary to agree a way forward for the talks to start again, after their breakdown last November. There appears to be a consensus in London, Belfast and Dublin that the 'three-strand' approach of the last talks will not be repeated and that there is a need for a less rigid structure. This would allow a series of bilateral contacts between the two governments and the four main political parties in the province. One point on which the UK will be pressing is the prospect of change on the Irish constitutional claim over Northern Ireland. While not expecting the Irish to concede the claim instantly, British ministers are looking for a change of tone. When the negotiations broke down the Dublin government's statement that it only 'could', not 'would', hold a referendum on changing its constitution if an overall settlement were reached caused particular difficulties for the unionists. The new Irish government, which took office only last week, has not indicated its stance on this issue. Mr Dick Spring, the new Irish foreign minister, is expected to hold an informal meeting with Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, later this week to set dates for the first Anglo-Irish conference meetings.

British and Irish ministers condemned the IRA murders of two Protestants in County Londonderry on Sunday night and said their action was in stark contrast to those working for peace in the province. Sir Hugh Annesley, chief constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, who attended the meeting, said he would continue to press for tougher police powers - including removal of a terrorist suspect's right to silence - in spite of speculation that his proposals will be rejected by government. Sunday's murders were the first civilian killings by the IRA in the past six months, and there has been a notable increase in loyalist terrorism. At the meeting Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, and Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, considered a report from officials on the prospects for political progress based on the framework envisaged by the three-stranded approach on relationships which was abandoned in November 1992. It is not expected that progress will be made before the European elections in June. Before the conference the Rev Ian Paisley, Democratic Unionist leader, handed in a letter of protest. He criticised Sir Patrick for continuing with what he described as the destruction of Northern Ireland in cahoots with Dublin before the IRA's murder victims had even been buried. Last night, Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, warned that the Ulster peace initiative was 'in danger of going into crisis'.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

The appeal followed an apparent endorsement of Sinn Fein's good faith by Mr Al Gore, the US vice-president, who said during a stop-over at Shannon airport that Northern Ireland was at the top of the US foreign policy agenda. Mr Gore said Tuesday's joint statement by Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, and Mr John Hume, Social Democratic and Labour party leader, 'speaks for itself'. The statement, issued after a meeting in Dublin, said the three leaders were 'totally and absolutely committed to democratic and peaceful methods of resolving our political problems'. Last night Mr James Molyneux, leader of the Ulster Unionist party, said he had been assured by Mr Gore in a telephone conversation yesterday that the US was not acting as an intermediary in the peace process. Mr Hume said Mr Gore had urged him to do everything possible to involve Unionists in the process. Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, said the army and the RUC had already responded to the reduced terrorist threat in Northern Ireland. 'Certain things are not in place that were,' he said. In a further indication of British willingness to reduce the security presence, Mr John Major said that 'a whole range of options' would be open once the government was convinced that there would be no return to IRA violence. But he said there could be no progress until Sinn Fein clarified last week's declaration of a 'complete' end to terrorism. 'All that has to be said is for Sinn Fein to say quite clearly, 'yes, under no circumstances will we go back to violence'. That is all I am waiting to hear,' he said. Mr Major refused to be drawn on Mr Reynolds' decision to meet Mr Adams. 'The Taoiseach and I have worked together and I don't doubt his personal commitment,' he said. Sir Patrick told members of the Orange Order in Belfast last night there was no question of the British and Irish governments imposing a solution on the people of the province. Mr Jim Rodgers, a Belfast councillor with contacts in the Loyalist community, said he believed the Dublin meeting was viewed by some terrorists as confirmation that republicans were influencing government policy. Mr Rodgers claimed that the reduction in security announced by Sir Patrick had been agreed at a secret meeting last week. Mr Martin McGuinness, a member of Sinn Fein's ruling executive, said there had been no reduction in security levels. Mr Ian Paisley, leader of the hardline Democratic Unionists, accused Mr Major of acting like a dictator, but said the party had no plans to ask its supporters to take to the streets.

By far the majority of privatised government stocks have outperformed the market - that is, fared better than the average share - both immediately after flotation and in subsequent years. Investing in former public sector companies does not guarantee success, as buyers of shares in British Steel and British Aerospace can testify. Both have underperformed the FTSE-100 index by 50 per cent since their privatisations in 1988 and 1981 respectively, although in BAe's case the underperformance has occurred mainly in the last two years. However, BAe and British Steel are the exceptions rather than the rule. More typical - and more relevant to NIE - is the performance of the electricity companies since privatisation of the sector began three years ago. Scottish Power and Hydro-Electric, considered to be the tightest priced of all electricity stocks in the electricity privatisation process, have seen their share rise from 240p in June 1991 to 323p and 342p respectively. If they had merely kept pace with the market, their prices would be 279p. NIE's flotation benefits from the more generous approach which the government displayed in privatising the England and Wales electricity companies. One view is that this is because the NIE flotation will face competition for funds from the sale of the third tranche of BT shares. Northern Ireland Electricity procures electricity from the province's four generators, privatised separately last year, and transmits and supplies it to the whole of the province. The company is being offered at Pounds 362m, consisting of 164.6m shares of 220p each. For utility investors, the most important consideration is the dividend yield, and for NIE this is high. The average historic yield for the regional electricity companies in the England and Wales is about 5.3 per cent; for NIE it is 5.8 per cent. This, together with the City's positive view of NIE's management and prospects, means that, barring unexpected changes in the market, shares in the company are likely to rise on the first day of trading on June 21. Some analysts believe 10 per cent is possible. That does not necessarily mean that everyone should apply for shares. Investors hoping for large, quick profits will probably be disappointed. More than 800,000 people have registered an interest in the shares, and that means that some may get less than 100 shares, the minimum application. Profits, after dealing costs, of such a small amount of shares would be virtually negligible. Investors should therefore consider the long term. Among concerns about tying up capital for long periods will be the unpredicatibility of Northern Ireland politics. Government practice is to replace assets which have been damaged through terrorism but there are no cast iron guarantees. Even if all costs of a terrorist attack were recovered, there could be long term effects on staff morale and productivity. Analysts believe such considerations are outweighed by the positive elements offered by NIE. Chief among these is that the regulatory regime covering the province is settled until at least 1997. In England and Wales, the regulator has said that he may refer the generators to the Mergers and Monopolies Commission, and the 12 regional electricity companies (Recs) face regulatory reviews over the next year which could limit their ability to increase profits and increase dividends. Northern Ireland has no such uncertainty and its innovatory regulatory regime means that most of the prospective income in transmission and distribution is guaranteed, regardless of whether sales go up and down. If unit sales fall, NIE is allowed to raise its prices. This is a double edged sword. It increases potential for slack marketing in the lead-up to the competitive threat posed by British Gas which may start selling gas to households from the middle of the decade. However, it also provides the company with an even greater incentive for cutting costs. The scope is considerable given that there are six employees per thousand customers compared with the Recs' 3.6. All this means that NIE should be able to increase dividends by about 12 per cent a year for the next four years and most analysts are advising clients to apply for shares. Some, including John Wilson, of UBS, believe it may even be worth buying shares in the market early on the first day of trading, before prices rise significantly. 'The company makes an excellent long term investment and provides a good hedge against the regulatory risk of the electricity companies in England and Wales,' he says.

Self-catering, bed and breakfast accommodation and touring caravan and camping sites reported big increases in business, although hotel occupancy fell by 1 per cent. The board's annual report says that holidaymakers are spending less because of the recession and the domestic market is weak.

Perhaps the best illustration was the setting up earlier this year of a Northern Ireland select committee. This was a move the Ulster Unionist leader and his party colleagues had long pushed for. This week it was Sinn Fein's turn to demonstrate the power of its influence, as the British government appeared to bow to US pressure over whether members of the IRA's political wing would be invited to an important Belfast investment forum. Thursday's acknowledgement that a handful of Sinn Fein councillors would be invited followed threats by several US institutions and corporations to boycott the conference unless Sinn Fein was included. This pressure was augmented by Congressional supporters of the Irish republican cause who urged the US administration not to allow Mr Ron Brown, US commerce secretary, to attend unless London modified its initial stance that Sinn Fein would not be invited. As one knowledgeable observer of the peace process observed in the wake of the climbdown, Sinn Fein is more than just a party representing a small minority of the electorate in Northern Ireland. The decision is thought to have had an important bearing on the setting of an earlier-than-expected date for the start of talks between Sinn Fein and government officials, in effect entailing that they had to start before the conference on December 13 and 14. The government said on Thursday it would start talks on December 7. However the talks were put back 48 hours last night at the request of Sinn Fein. There has been a widespread impression that the handling of the invitations was botched by the government, with the effect that efforts to drum up much-needed investment at the conference risk being overshadowed by politics. Sinn Fein councillors on the two local council committees whose members are being sent invitations include Mr Mitchel McLaughlin, the organisation's northern chairman and a leading political strategist. If Mr McLaughlin does attend, the economic news emerging from the forum would have to be important indeed to distract attention from his presence at a conference to be launched by Mr John Major, the prime minister. The two committees whose members are now to be invited to the conference are the development committee of Belfast City Council and the city marketing committee of Londonderry City Council. According to the Northern Ireland Office, a total of six Sinn Fein councillors are on the two bodies.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P8651 Political Organizations.

But no new initiatives emerged from the ministerial meeting that might kick-start the stalled round-table political talks. It had been hoped that yesterday's meeting of the Anglo-Irish conference might give a fresh momentum to the talks process now that the province's local elections are over. But Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, said the UK government's proposals were still incomplete and would only be presented 'as and when the talks resume'. He said the British blueprint would not be 'an agreed paper between the two governments'. Mr Dick Spring, the republic's foreign minister, said he was satisfied that there would be further consultations between before the British paper was completed. The province's political parties abandoned negotiations last November without agreeing new political structures. The refusal by the hard-line Democratic Unionist party to sit at the table until the Irish Republic relinquishes its territorial claim to the province continues to be the main hurdle to further progress. Sir Patrick said yesterday that articles two and three of the Irish constitution, which set out the republic's territorial claim on the province, were 'a significant factor' blocking progress. Mr Spring reiterated his government's position that he would not accept preconditions and issued a plea to unionists. 'Why not come and talk?' he said. 'It doesn't help anybody to set out preconditions. We are available for dialogue.' Both ministers said they intend to initiate private meetings with the leaders of Northern Ireland's main political parties in an attempt to establish the basis for fresh talks. Sir Patrick welcomed the moves by the republic to amend extradition legislation 'to close loopholes that have recently been opened up by judicial decisions'. The question of internment, demanded by unionist leaders in the wake of the IRA's latest bombing offensive in Northern Ireland, was not discussed.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

In a speech in the republican stronghold of west Belfast, the Sinn Fein president said 'genuine' peace in Ireland depended upon the British government's recognition of the right of the Irish people to determine their own future. 'Partition and continued support for the loyalist veto are a recipe for ongoing conflict,' Mr Adams warned. Downing Street said last night it would study Mr Adams's words carefully, but 'what the people in Northern Ireland need is a signal that the terrorists will call a permanent cessation of their violence'. Mr Adams's speech came as Mr John Major accused the IRA's political wing of being desperate to avoid a decision on whether to accept the Downing Street declaration. The British prime minister sought to increase pressure on republican leaders by describing their calls for clarification as 'an increasingly desperate attempt to avoid facing up to the clear choice that confronts them'. Last night's developments overshadowed concern expressed earlier on both sides of the Irish border about calls by Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, for 'demilitarisation' in Northern Ireland. Speaking little more than a day after Mr Martin McGuinness, another senior Sinn Fein spokesman, dismissed as unacceptable any British offer short of eventual withdrawal, Mr Adams called on London and Dublin to make the 'exercise of Irish national self-determination' their 'policy objective'. 'Partitionist solutions cannot create the conditions of peace and democracy in Ireland,' Mr Adams said. 'Since the partition of Ireland, the Irish people's right to self-determination has been denied by the British government and parliament. Partition represents the most fundamental denial of democracy.' The Sinn Fein president acknowledged that the joint declaration contained 'for the first time ever' a recognition by Britain that the Irish people 'as a whole' had the right to self-determination. But he said the 'deadlock' had not yet been broken. He also acknowledged the right of unionists - whom he called 'the Irish minority' - to be consulted. Downing Street has taken great pains to reassure unionists that the joint declaration did nothing to dilute their effective veto over any change in the province's constitutional status. Addressing MPs on the day the joint declaration was agreed last month, Mr Major stated specifically that the document contained no suggestion that Northern Ireland's future status 'should be decided by a single act of self-determination by the people of Ireland as whole'. Writing in this morning's edition of the unionist Belfast Newsletter, Mr Major pledged to pursue 'with renewed vigour' the so-called three-stranded talks which began in 1992. Mr Major said that agreement in the talks, which involve constitutional parties in London, Dublin and Belfast, was a 'priority' for 1994. Sinn Fein is excluded from the process, but Mr Major confirmed that the party would be allowed to take part three months after a cessation of IRA violence. In a passage aimed at the Reverend Ian Paisley, leader of the hard-line Democratic Unionist party, Mr Major said suggestions that the joint declaration was a sell-out were 'nonsense'. But unionists reacted angrily to the Irish prime minister's assertion that 'the time has come to start the process of demilitarisation of the Northern conflict'.

But the crisis may have only been postponed, not averted, with many Labour MPs adamant that the party should pull out of the government coalition in the row over the controversial appointment of Mr Harry Whelehan, the attorney-general, as president of the High Court. Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, promised a full explanation in parliament on Tuesday for the appointment and an emergency meeting of Labour MPs decided to delay further action until then. This means that today's meeting between Mr Dick Spring, the Labour leader and foreign minister, and Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, will go ahead. At this meeting the Dublin and London governments will review progress on the joint framework document for a durable settlement for Northern Ireland. Mr Spring said yesterday, after the six-hour meeting with his parliamentary party, that he would await Mr Reynolds' explanation but in the meantime all Labour ministers would boycott cabinet meetings. Mr Reynolds, in a statement yesterday, warned of the damage that could be inflicted on the peace initiative by an early election. This same view was expressed by Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein leader. In a statement on Saturday he said: 'The peace process is still at a delicate and sensitive stage. I hope that the present strains between the government parties can be resolved satisfactorily and that party political and other difficulties can be put aside.' Sinn Fein in particular is anxious to avoid an early election, not simply for the delay to peace talks it would cause, but for the chances that the party might have to deal with a new prime minister, perhaps less accommodating to republican sentiment than Mr Reynolds and his Fianna Fail party, traditionally the party of constitutional republicanism. The peace process has already been shaken by the murder of a Newry postal worker on Thursday. In a move to distance itself from the Newry incident, the IRA issued a further statement saying the use of all weapons had been banned since its ceasefire announcement at the beginning of September. In spite of the Newry incident, the improved security climate in Northern Ireland was underlined by the attendance at yesterday's Belfast remembrance day service of the Duchess of Kent, the first member of the Royal family to take part in more than 25 years. The trigger for Labour's threat to quit the Irish government was Mr Reynolds decision to appoint Mr Whelehan as High Court president. Mr Whelehan, a leading conservative lawyer, has on several occasions been embroiled in controversy as attorney-general, including the famous X-case - the 14-year-old rape victim who was stopped from having an abortion in England. But observers point to the sharp deterioration in relations between Mr Reynolds and Mr Spring which a senior government official said had reached an 'irretrievable breakdown'.

0,FT943-2783 ,"FT943-2783 _AN-EIRAQABFFT 940917   FT  17 SEP 94 / US court bars extradition of IRA man: Appeal against San Francisco ruling expected      By JIMMY BURNS   The government is expected to appeal against a ruling by a US judge blocking the extradition of a convicted IRA gunman. Ms Barbara Caulfield, a San Francisco federal judge, ruled against the extradition of Mr James Smyth on the grounds of 'the punishment, detention and restrictions on his personal liberties' that he would face on his return to prison in Northern Ireland. The ruling drew an angry reaction from prison officers in Northern Ireland and from some unionist officials. Mr Finlay Spratt, chairman of Northern Ireland's Prison Officers' Association, said the judge's decision was an 'absolute disgrace'. Northern Ireland had 'one of the most relaxed penal systems in the world'. The ruling was also seized on by Irish-Americans sympathetic to the republican cause. Mr Smyth said he planned to stay in the US 'until the British leave Ireland' and to campaign on behalf of three other Irish nationals who remain in US prisons. UK government officials yesterday played down the political significance of the ruling, indicating they would not allow it to get in the way of their collaboration with the US administration over the current Anglo-Irish peace process. They do not believe there has been any political interference with the judge's decision. Officials think it likely that a US court of appeal will eventually rule in favour of extradition. The case is not expected to be settled for some months, by which time political developments may mean Mr Smyth will return voluntarily. Mr Smyth was arrested in San Francisco in 1992 after spending nine years as a fugitive from British justice. Before the latest ruling a request for bail had been refused by a US appeal court.

0,FT943-14307 ,"FT943-14307 _AN-EGODBACFFT 940715   FT  15 JUL 94 / Law change mooted to smooth Ulster talks      By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor   The government is willing to consider amendments to the 1920 Government of Ireland Act as part of the effort to secure a new political settlement in Northern Ireland. But Mr John Major, the prime minister, will today tell Mr Albert Reynolds, his Irish counterpart, that an explicit pledge by Dublin to modify the republic's constitutional claim to the province is vital to any hope of an agreement. British officials insist that it will be impossible to restart talks between the constitutional parties without a commitment by the republic to incorporate into article two of its constitution the principle of majority consent in Ulster to any change in the status of the province. Moderate unionist leaders have made it clear that they will not participate in a resumption of the 'three-strand' search for a political settlement without such a pledge from Dublin. But Mr Reynolds has been reluctant to give any firm commitment in advance of the conclusion of an overall accord between unionists and nationalists. As a result, talks between London and Dublin on a framework document to restart the talks process have become deadlocked. Mr Major and Mr Reynolds will seek to break that deadlock at their meeting today on the margins of the European summit in Brussels. In spite of recent gloom in both capitals about the prospect of a breakthrough before the Anglo-Irish summit pencilled in for late next week, officials in London have not ruled out the possibility that the two prime ministers will find a compromise. The expectation is that if they do not the summit will be postponed until September. British officials say that Mr Reynolds' recent public calls for changes in the Ireland Act have not yet been matched by specific suggestions for amendments. There is also some puzzlement as to why Dublin regards that legislation  - which predates the division of Ireland - as such an important symbol of Irish partition. The 1973 Northern Ireland Act is a much clearer assertion of Westminster's sovereignty over the province. The view in London is that as long as the principle of consent is not undermined the government is ready to consider changes to the 1920 legislation as part of a package to restart the process. Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, told the Commons yesterday that he saw no particular need for changes but was ready to consider any proposals. It is understood that the liaison group drawing up the proposed framework document has still to settle the form of the new cross-border groups demanded by nationalist politicians in the province as a quid pro quo for the creation of a new Ulster assembly. Some differences remain over the degree to which the two governments should seek to prescribe the form of devolved administration. The London government appears confident that they could quickly be resolved if Mr Major and Mr Reynolds break the deadlock over the constitutional claim. By contrast there appears little optimism in London about the prospects for an early end to violence in the province. Intelligence reports suggest that the latest escalation in attacks by the IRA might represent a deliberate show of strength as the precursor to a temporary ceasefire. The government still believes that the faction represented by Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, is looking for an escape route from the violence to allow it to join the talks process. But the apparent determination of hardline sections of the IRA to continue the killing has all but extinguished hopes of a quick 'clean' break with the past 25 years.

In an interview with the Financial Times yesterday, he explained why London, unlike Dublin, does not yet accept IRA bona fides that the violence is permanently over and also what role he hopes the US will play in the peace process. He also hinted at the contents of a forthcoming 'framework document' for round-table talks, being drafted by the British and Irish governments. He said the ceasefire was 'a remarkably important step and a very welcome one'. He added: 'There was no condition attached. There was no finite character to it. Those are very welcome features.' But he said that the 'profound levels of suspicion which are endemic on both sides of the community and very strongly present in the unionist side' made it essential to clarify that the ceasefire was permanent. 'Both governments have insisted that there shall be a permanent end to violence. I don't doubt for a minute the sincerity with which the Irish government believe that it is over for good. We have to be satisfied from what these people say themselves about their own intentions. We are not insisting on a particular form of words. We just need to have an unequivocal assertion that they intend it should be over for good.' In a seeming effort to make it easier for Sinn Fein and the republicans to respond, he repeatedly stressed that the key to opening the door to talks was a public assurance by republicans that the intention behind the ceasefire was a permanent end to violence. Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, wrote last week in the Irish Times that Dublin, the US and the nationalist Social Democratic Labour party in the province had responded 'positively and correctly' to the ceasefire. Sir Patrick said: 'That just falls short, why not just say 'they got our intention right'. If Mr Adams were to say 'the Irish have correctly perceived our intention, to give it up for good' that's fine. Why not say it?' He ruled out a proposal mooted in Dublin last week for a trilateral heads of state summit between the US, the UK and the republic, but saw a positive role for the US in using 'its unique channels of communication with republicans' to persuade them to make it plain publicly that they intend that violence is over for good. The US understood the realities of Northern Ireland, he said, and it would be very helpful if the Clinton administration were to point out to the republican movement the genuine basis for the British government's uncertainty over IRA intentions. If British concerns could be satisfied, he said, it was worth remembering that Sinn Fein could be included in direct exploratory talks with London within three months. The word 'within' had been used, he said, to preserve some sort of flexibility. The framework document intended to kick-start all-party talks later this year, would be a negotiable document. 'There is no question of imposition.' He acknowledged there were on-going difficulties but said London now accepted that amendment to the republic's territorial claim to Northern Ireland 'would need to be put as part of an overall package'. This would be essential to win unionist support for an overall accommodation. Sir Patrick was ambivalent on whether Dublin's insistence on amendment of the 1920 Government of Ireland Act, which established partition, would be included in the framework document. 'Everybody knows the government of Ireland Act is relevant to the package. What the circumstances in which they are going to be relevant maybe time will tell.' He said the dispute over whether future cross-border structures would have executive powers could possibly be dealt with by legislatures in both Northern Ireland and the republic delegating powers to joint boards or bodies. 'That seems to make a lot of sense,' he said.   Countries:-  IEZ  Ireland, EC.     GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P9721 International Affairs.   Types:-  NEWS  General News.

Mr Reynolds' proposals for a 'united Ireland by consent', and active British involvement in that aim, are central to the peace formula that he intends to discuss with Mr Major in Dublin today. Although Dublin officials were yesterday emphasising that they still hoped for progress, the statements cast further gloom on Mr Reynolds' aspirations for 'peace by Christmas'. One of the main concessions Mr Reynolds seeks is is a statement by London supporting 'self determination of the Irish people based on consent freely expressed, north and south'. This would guarantee a majority veto in Northern Ireland to any change, but would also give nationalists the satisfaction of an all-Ireland dimension. Like London, Dublin is convinced that the IRA is ready to end its military campaign. But it is convinced that Britain will have to do more than simply demand a unilateral republican ceasefire. A clue as to why Dublin has such faith in its formula lies in a recent speech by Mr Gerry Adams, the leader of Sinn Fein, who said: 'Partition was brought about by a British act of parliament for which not a single Irish vote was cast. The consent of the Irish people was never sought and has never been freely given. That is the nub of our problems.' Dublin officials have made little effort in the past week to disguise their exasperation with Downing Street and their concern that Mr Major's 'understanding' with the Ulster Unionists is the main obstacle to progress on their own formula.

This emerged as the Irish government yesterday sought to play down its plans for the early release of IRA prisoners, announced on Monday, after an angry response from unionist politicians and warnings that they could derail the peace process. The meeting, expected to be informal, follows the postponement of talks due last week. It will come after a meeting between British and Irish officials this Friday to resume detailed work on the so-called framework document. Expectations are mounting that the document could be completed by mid-December. A meeting on it last week is understood to have resulted in progress on the issue of north-south relations, one of the sticking points that has impeded progress since the summer. There are also long-standing differences over constitutional issues, in particular Dublin's territorial claim over Northern Ireland enshrined in Articles 2 and 3 of the Irish constitution. A completion date next month would coincide with the first anniversary of the signing of the Downing Street declaration on December 15 1993. Downing Street said yesterday that Mr John Major, the prime minister, would launch an international investment conference in Belfast, two days before the anniversary. Irish officials said yesterday the release of IRA prisoners did not have an immediate bearing on the framework document. The issue is not controversial in Dublin and Mr Albert Rey-nolds, the Irish prime minister, and other government officials had signalled the prospect of an early release of IRA prisoners several times since the IRA ceasefire on August 31. The Irish government's move was attacked by the Reverend Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionist party, and some mainland British politicians. Mr Paisley claimed the British government had a secret agenda and was working on plans of its own for prisoner releases. Mr Andrew Hunter, leader of the Commons back-bench committee on Northern Ireland and Tory MP for Basingstoke, said: 'It is a very serious miscalculation on the part of Dublin, the sort of miscalculation which can undermine confidence in the peace process.' An IRA commander was jailed for 25 years yesterday. English-born Dr Feilim O'Hadhmaill, 36, a lecturer at the University of Central Lancashire, Preston, was sentenced for spearheading an IRA bomb plot on mainland UK before the August ceasefire.

The International Investment Forum had been too hastily organised, it was said. It was too close to Christmas and executives would not want to visit Northern Ireland. There had been a poor response from potential investors. Mr Major would find himself preaching to the converted - businesses which had already invested in the province and any members of the local great and good that the Industrial Development Board, the organisers, could manage to attract. To make matters worse, Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, which had been prevaricating all week on whether it would attend the conference, threatened to boycott it and badger delegates on their way in to the forum venue - the much bombed but now renovated Europa Hotel. In the event, the conference was judged by the delegates to have been a great success. A US official accompanying Mr Ron Brown, the US secretary of commerce, who represented President Bill Clinton, said: 'It has gone extraordinarily well. There were some last minute panics and some glitches over Sinn Fein. But they were not going to be allowed to wreck the conference. There was more than a reasonable turn-out.' Mr Brown was involved in a marathon of speechmaking in the province before attending the conference. He was also thought to have been instrumental in persuading Sinn Fein to attend. Six Sinn Fein councillors were there, ostensibly to put their point of view to delegates. Though they staged a walk-out, there were no Sinn Fein demonstrations outside. Mr Brown's involvement in the conference was important - but it was Mr Major's presence that sealed its success. More than 300 delegates finally agreed to attend, more than expected. Many were local, with delegations from the US, the Far East and Continental Europe. With their partners they packed the banqueting hall for the pre-conference, black-tie dinner on Tuesday evening. Mr Major made a bland speech, keeping his powder dry for the conference yesterday. But it brought the house down. Half the gathering gave him a standing ovation. The Duke of Abercorn, the chairman of Laganside Development, a local quango, summed up the upbeat mood. 'The people of Northern Ireland are deeply grateful and appreciative that Northern Ireland tops his personal agenda,' he said. Mr Brian Carlin of Shorts, the Belfast aerospace company, said: 'It is very important Mr Major is personally involved in this. He has given his personal imprimatur and that is the highest recommendation you can get.' Mr Don O'Callaghan, an executive with the Australian Meekaharra Minerals group which has interests in Northern Ireland, said: 'The IDB has done an exceptionally good job. It has paid attention to detail, and organised the presentations superbly. There were not too many speeches and they were not too long. 'It is of major importance that the prime minister is involved. His presence gave great comfort to overseas investors.' Perhaps most encouraging for the organisers is that the message that Northern Ireland is a safe place for investment seemed to be getting through. Mr Alan Lewis, chief executive of the British textiles group Illingworth Morris, said: 'While the violence was going on I had my doubts about Northern Ireland. But now it looks a likely place for investment. The competitive wage rates and incentives on offer mean you must pay it attention.' Mr Chung Sung Moon, managing director of Shin Ho Paper Manufacturing of Korea, agreed: 'There are definitely possibilities for investment here now. We have looked at Scotland but this is a better possibility.'   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P9611 Administration of General Economic Programs.

0,FT921-15154 ,"FT921-15154 _AN-CAKAKADTFT 920111   FT  11 JAN 92 / Terrorists exploit the gaps in mainland defences: The difficulties of countering the bombers' ever changing tactics      By JIMMY BURNS and RALPH ATKINS   THE IRA bomb attack in Whitehall yesterday has again highlighted the difficulties faced by the security forces in countering one of the best-organised and determined terrorist organisations in the world. It was the latest incident in a long-running IRA campaign on the mainland and in Northern Ireland that has deliberately avoided following a set pattern. IRA tactics during the past 18 months have included firebombing shops, disrupting railway lines and shooting military personnel, in addition to the continual threat to any 'legitimate political target' - anyone considered to be working for the British state. One security expert with extensive experience of dealing with IRA terrorism conceded last night: 'London is proving very difficult to defend because the IRA has so many targets and a variety of methods of attack.' From the IRA's perspective, yesterday's bomb was another coup. While requiring some preparatory reconnaissance of the area, the small bomb in a briefcase is the type of device that will barely have strained the organisation's military resources. Yet it prompted political reaction and media coverage quite out of proportion to the limited physical damage caused. While political reaction continues to be focused on condemnation of the IRA and calls for increased security, yesterday's bombing has again raised questions about the effectiveness of current security measures, and whether the IRA can be militarily neutralised. Since the IRA's last intrusion into Whitehall - the mortar attack on Downing Street 11 months ago - traffic controls have been introduced, video cameras have been installed in government buildings, and windows and doors have been reinforced against bomb attacks. These measures have been taken against a background of repeated police appeals for increased public vigilance and a continuing undercover security operation. Such efforts may have reduced the risk of political assassinations and large-scale injury to civilians, but they did not stop an IRA terrorist cell yesterday identifying significant security gaps: The bomb was found only because of a warning by the IRA which named the small street where it had been planted. Mr John Major, the prime minister, left nearby Downing Street after the warning had been received but before the bomb had been located. The bomb exploded before the surrounding area had been fully cleared or the device tackled by bomb disposal experts. Anti-terrorist squad chiefs believe the IRA mainland campaign involves no more than six terrorists, probably travelling to and from Northern Ireland or the Irish Republic. But these assessments have not been translated into any public breakthrough in terms of arrests. Home Office figures show that 85 individuals were detained on the mainland in connection with terrorism related to Northern Ireland in the first nine months of last year, but only one was charged under the Prevention of Terrorism Act. Security experts say that police on the mainland are too stretched in numbers and cash terms to attempt blanket protection over a far more densely populated area than Northern Ireland. Even if the resources were available, both the government and opposition believe that Northern Ireland-type security measures, involving the police and the military, would be politically unacceptable. A meeting yesterday between Mr Peter Brooke, Northern Ireland secretary, and leaders of the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party appears to have made further progress towards re-starting 'round-table' talks on the province's political future, Ralph Atkins writes. Yesterday's meeting was staged by using a video conferencing link, with Mr Brooke in London and SDLP leaders in Belfast.

The ministers met near the Irish Republic's County Cavan  border with Ulster after the opening of a restored waterway link  between the republic and the north.    But before talks were under way, fresh violence in Belfast  brought security issues back to the top of the agenda.    IRA gunmen killed a former regular Army soldier from the  Shankill Road as he worked as a security guard near the city  centre. Loyalists bombed a Sinn Fein office at Belfast City Hall  injuring two workmen and a soldier was hurt in a blast at the  Fort George Army base in Londonderry.    At the weekend in Dublin, the Loyalist Ulster Volunteer  Force  paramilitary organisation attacked a city centre pub being used  by Sinn Fein for a fundraising event.    The ministers had planned to concentrate on political  questions following Britain's response last week to a series of  questions about the Downing Street peace declaration posed by  Sinn Fein.    Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew and deputy  Irish premier and foreign minister Dick Spring later said they  pledged to maintain the current ""highest ever level"" of  cross-border security co-operation to combat the terrorists.    Sir Patrick said what had happened in Dublin had  demonstrated  the problem of terrorism was one that had to be faced by the  security forces on both sides of the border. ""The highest  degree of co-operation will be maintained between us,"" he said.    Irish Justice Minister Maire Geoghegan-Quinn, who was also  at  the talks, said she would be presenting a report to cabinet  colleagues in Dublin tomorrow on the weekend shooting and  bombing attempt. She will meet Irish Police Commissioner Patrick  Culligan tomorrow to review security precautions being applied  in Dublin and border areas to counter loyalist raids.    On the political front Sir Patrick said he had noted and was  grateful for the ""very positive Irish government response"" to  Britain's statement last week following Sinn Fein's request for  clarification of the peace document.    Prime Minister John Major and Irish premier Albert Reynolds  are to meet in London later this week to assess the development  of their peace initiative.    Sir Patrick said: ""Both governments stand shoulder to  shoulder in this respect and in their attitude to Sinn Fein and  the IRA and the use of violence for political purposes.""    Also at today's discussions was Northern Ireland Office  junior minister Michael Ancram who has been involved in  behind-the-scenes talks with political leaders in Belfast in a  bid to force a restart of the stalled inter-party talks process  on the future of the province.    Mr Spring reported that a considerable amount of work had  been done towards establishing a framework for fresh talks but  further progress had still to be made.    Security measures in and around the border area fringed by  the Irish Republic's County Cavan and Northern Ireland's County  Fermanagh was intense from daybreak for the top-level  get-together.    Sir Patrick and Mr Spring jointly declared open a canal  connecting Northern Ireland's Lough Erne and the River Shannon  on the southern side of the border. The canal first opened 125  years ago but closed soon afterwards as a nautical flop. It has  been restored at a cost of 30 million pounds in a project funded  partly by European Union funds and backed by both the British  and Irish governments.     "

Mr Gerry Adams is today expected to use a keynote speech to refer to 'positive aspects' of the Downing Street declaration but to stop short of giving the document his approval. The Sinn Fein president will focus on what he sees as the declaration's shortcomings on the issue of Irish self-determination. But as republican leaders responded favourably to this week's efforts by London and Dublin to address nationalist concerns about their joint initiative, Anglo-Irish tensions were heightened by an Irish High Court decision to free a terrorist suspect wanted for questioning over the murder of a soldier. Mr Joseph Magee, 27, from Armagh, was released after Mr Justice Feargus Flood ruled that the alleged offence of killing a soldier in Derby was a political one for which he could not be extradited. Meanwhile, mounting unionist hostility towards the direction of the initiative was underlined when Mr John Taylor, a senior Ulster Unionist MP, urged his party leadership to boycott new political talks. The IRA's political wing yesterday reacted positively to an article published in the Irish News, the Belfast-based nationalist newspaper, in which Mr John Major, the prime minister, made an eve-of-conference appeal to republican leaders to embrace the peace process. Mr Mitchel McLoughlin, Sinn Fein's Northern Ireland chairman, said Mr Major's statement deserved 'very, very careful study'. He said the article - along with a number of recent speeches by senior ministers - had been 'of assistance'. Mr McLoughlin said an offer of a temporary IRA ceasefire made last year during the secret negotiations between the British government and Sinn Fein was 'still on the table'. Mr Major emphasised in the article that the joint declaration left 'no conceivable reason for continued violence' and that London would not 'try to persuade people to go for Irish unity'. But he combined this uncompromising message with a vision of the possible outcome of political talks designed to reassure nationalists. After yesterday's Irish High Court decision Mr Michael Mates, the former Northern Ireland minister, said the case was 'another example of what we have been complaining about to the Irish for a long time.

0,FT931-12104 ,"FT931-12104 _AN-DA4ASAANFT 930130   FT  30 JAN 93 / Minding Your Own Business: Two companies struggling from the Belfast ruins - Jimmy Burns visits a business park on the dividing line between catholic and protestant      By JIMMY BURNS   THE FARSET Enterprise business park in West Belfast backs off against an 18ft high fence separating two communities: protestant and catholic. Its front gate gives on to the Springfield Road, a notorious killing ground for the terrorists on both sides. Eight years ago the site was a piece of open ground: the houses that once stood there bombed to ruins. It became a community centre, and subsequently a business park, as a result of government investment aimed at healing the wounds of sectarian division. Farset is one of 26 business parks in Belfast, but the only one established where the the two communities meet. It is something of a test case for small businesses struggling to survive against the background of recession and a relentless campaign of political violence. Since the park opened three and half years ago, three small businesses have failed. But among the dozen that have survived, two in particular have shown what can be achieved when all the odds seemed stacked against them. Northern Ireland Fireworks has managed to carve a business niche with full government approval even though under Northern Ireland law the sale of fireworks manufactured locally is banned. It is run by Danny Davison, a 40-year-old former lorry driver who worked part-time, gathering experience of fireworks in companies in the UK and the US. In November 1990, Davison approached the Local Enterprise Development Unit LEDU (the goverment backed small business agency) for a Pounds 6,000 grant, and the Farset Business Park, which draws some if its funds from the International Fund for Ireland, for a further Pounds 5,000 low-interest loan (6 per cent repayable over two years) to set himself up as Northern Ireland's only local 'supplier of display kits and operator of fired shows.' A further Pounds 2,000 came from Davison's own savings and that of his partner. Davison imports his fireworks from England and mainland Europe under licence and then arranges their display with the approval of the security forces and the Northern Ireland Office. In the first year of trading in 1990/91 turnover was Pounds 24,000, just below the target of Pounds 25,000. In 1991/92 the company's order book expanded with turnover to Pounds 52,000, above the year's target of Pounds 50,000. A business that began with two full time staff, and two part-time staff, now employs 19. Davison says the company is successful because: 'What we try and give the public is something that is spectacular, but colourful and peaceful at the same time. There is no danger and the whole family can enjoy it. It makes a change from bombs.' He works from a ramshackle two floor hangar, filled with bits of cardboard, and rough sketched lay-outs. Here Davison tailors his display according to the budget of the customer, working out the position of the fireworks, the sequence of their explosions, on frames which range in height from 50ft to 3,000ft. The company arranges small displays for children's parties and club events, but its main income is generated by big public displays arranged for borough council festivals. Its customers have included staunchly loyalist organisations in the Shankill Road, as well as catholic charity events in southern Ireland. Among its more spectacular projects was the organisation of the firework display for Belfast's Christmas celebrations at the end of 1991. Politics is never far from this potentially explosive business. 'I know that if I moved this business to the Shankill some of the boys who work with me wouldn't come,' says Davison. And yet management of the business park has a policy of picking its tenants according to strict financial criteria. Charlotte McFarlane, the business park's administrator, says: 'We don't ask people what religion they belong to here. A business is a business or its not.' Its a philosophy which Davison shares. 'We straddle both sides of the community here,' he says. Bob Jenkins's flat Midlands accent is scarcely audible above the din of his workshop, but there is no doubting his determination to make his presence felt. 'I've got the distinction of being the only Englishman who stayed on. I like the place,' says Jenkins. A decade ago Jenkins worked as a quality engineer for the De Lorean sports car plant in Belfast. When the plant closed in 1983, some of the workers returned to England from where they had been recruited initially. Jenkins married a local woman and took a job with United Technologies in Derry. He subsequently sought employment in England, but not for long. In the mid-1980s the couple returned to Northern Ireland for an event that was to change the pattern of their lives: the birth of their child Laura Lee. When a spinal tumour left the child paraplegic Jenkins decided to put all his efforts into using his skills to develop orthopedic equipment for the physically handicapped. The idea for the company with his daughter's name arose out of Jenkins' links with Belfast's specialist Musgrave Park Hospital which adapted a wheelchair for Laura Lee. Jenkins recalls: 'At the time I was out of a job. One of the consultant orthopedic surgeons who knew I'd been an engineer said, 'There are various products the hospital is developing, why not start up your own business and see if you can help out?'' Jenkins in 1989 was among the first small business men to enter Farset. He obtained a capital grant of Pounds 5,100 covering 50 per cent of the cost of new plant and machinery and an employment related grant of Pounds 6,300 from LEDU. He also got a Pounds 3,100 grant from the Government's Making Belfast Work initiative specifically targetted at businesses in deprived areas of the city. His company's turnover was Pounds 10,000 in 1990/91, below the Pounds 12,000 target. In 1991/92 turnover was Pounds 17,000 below a target of Pounds 22,000. In his workshop Jenkins has been developing a range of products for disabled people ranging from special potty chairs and toilet training aids for children to suspended arm support systems for muscular dystrophy patients. But Jenkins admits that struggling to stay financially afloat in the middle of the recession has not been easy. He is about to go into partnership with another larger company at Farset which does structural steel and ornamental cast iron work. 'I hope to have the cash flow necessary to research and develop new products over a longer period, ' says Jenkins. 'The best small businesses can hope for in this society is to survive. I may not have grown much, but I'm still here. That gives me a sense of achievement.'

Prospects for political progress will be high on Downing Street's agenda. Both prime ministers are anxious to promote a dialogue between the two governments to avoid creating a lull in political activity which could encourage terrorists. However, little substantive progress appears to have been made towards resuming the political talks which collapsed last July - a task Mr Major set the province's four main political leaders when he met them two weeks ago. Difficulties remain over how to bridge a possible change of British government. The four leaders are expected to meet at Westminster tomorrow to discuss political progress. Mr James Molyneaux, Ulster Unionist leader, expressed hope earlier this week that talks could resume before the general election, but the likely choice of April 9 for the contest makes a resumption of formal talks beforehand extremely unlikely. So far only informal political discussions have been held between Mr James Molyneaux and the Rev Ian Paisley, the two unionist leaders, Mr John Hume, leader of the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party, and Dr John Alderdice, leader of the cross-community Alliance party. The four are expected to meet Mr Peter Brooke, Northern Ireland secretary, in Belfast on Monday to discuss the province's economy as part of government efforts to keep some form of dialogue going. Downing Street said today's topics were 'across the board', and would include the European Community as well as Northern Ireland. In December Mr Major agreed to meet every six months with Mr Charles Haughey, the then Irish prime minister.  The Financial Times   London Page 8  "

The shooting, the first since the IRA and Loyalist paramilitaries declared ceasefires, cast a shadow over the Northern Ireland peace process. It will almost certainly increase pressure on London and Dublin to step up their efforts to secure a dismantling of paramilitary arsenals. Dublin's decision to cancel the early release orders for the IRA prisoners was announced by Mrs Maire Geoghegan-Quinn, the Irish justice minister, after a meeting with Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister. Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, said he was 'deeply angered' by the 'callous and wicked' murder. There would be 'very natural suspicions' as to the motive for the crime. The attack took place in Newry. Three armed men, dressed as postmen and using a post office van, entered a fenced sorting centre. An employee was shot dead. Two of the men were arrested after a chase involving helicopters near the Irish border. The third escaped and was last night being sought by the Royal Ulster Constabulary. The RUC said the two men arrested were reported to be known republicans. But Sinn Fein indicated last night that the raid was not the work of the IRA and did not represent a breach of the two-month-old ceasefire. Republican sources in South Armagh, a strongly nationalist area, said the raid was the work of renegade, freelance republicans commiting a straightforward criminal act. Mr Gerry Adams, the president of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, was reported to be 'visibly shaken' when told the news by a reporter. He said: 'The RUC is engaged in a transparent attempt to damage the peace process.' A statement from the IRA said: 'On August 31 the IRA announced a complete cessation of military operations . . . This position has not changed.' Yesterday's killing came on the eve of a meeting between British and Irish officials to discuss the framework document which the two governments hope will form the basis of a durable political settlement in the province. Sir Patrick and Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, are to discuss the document in the Republic of Ireland on Monday. There have been signs in recent days that the two governments have made progress - particularly in the area of north-south relations - after a period of little progress. British and Irish politicians said the shooting showed the need for a rapid surrender of weapons. Mr Seamus Mallon, MP for Newry for the moderate nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party, said: 'All we do know for certain is that these people had a certain close relationship with the IRA, that they had weapons, and they had very clearly planned this operation . . . the same kind of operation they have used before.' His view was echoed by Mr David Trimble, Ulster Unionist party spokesman on legal affairs. He said: 'Freelance operations don't take place in that area unless they're licensed by the IRA.'

'This site is no good, the mud builds up, and then the animals just sink,' he says. Around him the small farm of peacocks, peahens, pigs, bullocks and sheep seems at odds with the desolate urban landscape. Drainage may be the most immediate problem but it is not the most serious for Hunter, a former shipyard worker, and his staff of six young unemployed men working on the farm as part of ACE (Action for Community Employment) the government-assisted scheme for the long-term unemployed. The farm stands on a piece of bombed-out waste land between two deeply divided Belfast communities: to the west, the Roman Catholic Ballymurphy estate, to the east, the protestant Springmarket estate. It was set up in the mid-1970s with government money in an attempt to reconcile the communities. The site picked for early residents Louis the pig and Barney the bullock was one of several groups of houses burnt down during sectarian rioting. Hunter himself has suffered as much as anybody from the social consequences of Ulster's 'Troubles'. A 37-year-old Protestant, he remembers a peaceful childhood on the Ballymurphy estate, but as an adult he was forced to move house to the Protestant enclave of Springmarket. He came to work on the farm after being made redundant. 'People have asked for this fence to be built to keep each other out,' he says, surveying the Ballymurphy estate beyond it. The fence and nearby walls  -bricks and concrete topped by a steel palisade - are among several so called 'peace lines' which zig-zag through the working-class areas of Belfast. While other walls in Europe have been taken down, the one by the farm has been built up over the last year. It was reinforced after a Protestant loyalist terrorist walked round the farm's perimeter fencing, into the Catholic area, and shot a 14-year-old schoolboy. At the begining of the decade, it was widely assumed that such barriers would come down in Northern Ireland as they seemed to be doing in Germany and Eastern Europe. However, more recently a more tragic process of osmosis has taken place: Yugoslavia and Northern Ireland have grown to reflect each other. In its bloody dissolution, Yugoslavia has revealed the underlying divisions that have sprung from religion, territorial dispossession, and the burden of history. These are familiar themes on Ulster's political landscape. While some community-based groups and church figures do reach out across the political divide in a spirit of reconciliation, the continuing violence of the paramilitary gangs - and the unreconstructed rhetoric of some politicians - springs from old fears, old antagonisms. Against such a background it is not surprising that the farm has not developed into the universal playground it was meant to be. But it has been become a symbol of frustrated hope in the midst of Northern Ireland's seemingly insoluble divisions, as poignant as the television images of correspondents in Yugoslavia trying to make sense of the latest exchange of sniper fire. 'No one has been shot on this farm and we are visited by Catholic and Protestant school children,' says Hunter. 'But the Catholics come in their buses, and the Protestants in theirs. They stay here for ten minutes, then they go back into their estates.' Staff at the farm are provided by the local office running the community employment programme, which provides grant-assisted part-time jobs at minimum rates for mainly young people who would otherwise be on unemployment benefit. The area has an unemployment rate of above 50 per cent. The local manager is Jackie Hewitt, a Protestant ex-trade unionist who has spent most of his working life commited to community work. He plans to move the farm to a better-drained area by the summer. But, like Hunter, he does not under-estimate the problems of building a more effective bridge across the sectarian divide. 'We are trying to reach out to the fringes of our community, but we don't fool ourselves that Protestants and Catholics are going to suddenly live together . . .

Both governments united in their condemnation of the attack - which led to calls yesterday for an inquiry into security operations at Heathrow - and insisted that they would not be knocked off course in attempts to reach a political settlement in the province. Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, and Mr Albert Reynolds, his Irish counterpart, claimed that the IRA's latest action and the failure of Sinn Fein to react positively to the Downing Street declaration would not deter London and Dublin from pressing on. At Westminster, Mr Major told MPs the 'unjustifiable' IRA attack would make 'no difference whatsoever' to the search for peace. He emphasised that the declaration set out 'a series of principles upon which we hope and intend to try and build a permanent peace in Northern Ireland'. In the Dail, Mr Reynolds attacked the IRA action as 'criminal and politically naive'. Both London and Dublin privately accept that the political momentum which followed December's declaration has largely been lost. They are now resigned to an extended process aimed at establishing an agreed framework for progress involving the province's constitutional parties. Speaking after yesterday's Anglo-Irish conference in London, Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, said the Heathrow attack had shown the IRA could not make its case via the democratic process and once again had resorted to force. Sir Patrick stressed both governments were committed to continuing the so-called three-stranded political talks process and added: 'There is no limit to our patience because there is no limit to the advantages that success in that process will bring.' He emphasised, however, that the prize of prosperity and peace might lie 'at the end of a very long road but a road on which neither government is going to weary of travelling'. In a speech in London last night, Sir Patrick reinforced the government's 'business as usual' approach by concentrating on the issue of relationships between Northern Ireland and the republic - strand two of the talks process. Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, in one of the most downbeat assessments from Dublin on the chances of an end to IRA action, said that 'the credit is running very low, if not totally expired' on the part of those who had yet to make up their mind on the Downing Street declaration. He said: 'Perhaps they (the IRA) are giving a message to both governments that they are not going to participate.' Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, said that the airport attack was a reminder that the causes of conflict remained. Mr Spring described as 'deplorable' reported remarks by Mr Adams that more 'spectaculars' like Heathrow were to be expected.

But Sinn Fein leader Mr Gerry Adams declined to shed further light on his claim on Monday night that Sinn Fein had been in 'protracted contact and dialogue' with the British government. Mr Adams' claim was yesterday emphatically denied by Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, as Ulster unionist MPs and Tory right-wingers warned the government to tread carefully. The offer by Mr John Major on Monday night was the first explicit move by the British prime minister to negotiate with the IRA's political wing. Sir Patrick said: 'No officials have been talking to Sinn Fein on behalf of the British government. We have always made it perfectly clear that there is going to be no negotiating with anybody who perpetrates or justifies the use of violence. That has been our policy and we stick to it.' The government has said the only contacts made with Sinn Fein have been those permitted at local and constituency level. Sinn Fein said privately last night that Mr Adams would not 'have said what he said' if he could not prove it. There were reports in the province last night that Mr Martin McGuinness, the Sinn Fein official, was involved in the contacts Mr Adams claimed took place. Mr Adams said yesterday: 'Mr Major has acknowledged the opportunity which exists. The onus remains on John Major to deal honestly and directly with the core issues.' He did not spell out what concessions the IRA was looking for, but added that Sinn Fein remained 'firmly committed' to what he called the 'Irish peace initiative'. The impression of intense behind-the-scenes activity to get talks started was reinforced when Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, hinted that his government might have had indirect talks with Sinn Fein. Responding to questions in the Dail (parliament), he said: 'No week passes that I do not have people from both communities . . . keeping me informed as to their views of the shift in opinion from various sectors.' Northern Ireland's unionist politicians have been united in their hostility to Mr Major's speech, however. The Reverend Martin Smyth, the Ulster Unionist MP for South Belfast, said his party's support for Mr Major would be called into question if there was any sign that he was failing to govern Northern Ireland 'purposefully'. But he added: 'If the IRA are prepared to put down their arms, then that may create a new situation . . . I accept that is the harsh reality of politics.' The Democratic Unionist Party, led by the Reverend Ian Paisley, was more critical. 'The strength of feeling in this province is for the defeat of IRA/Sinn Fein, not that a way should be made for them to get to the negotiating table,' he said.

0,FT934-5413 ,"FT934-5413 _AN-DLACFADQFT 931130   FT  30 NOV 93 / Better secret than sorry      By JOE ROGALY   Nobody with a rational cast of mind can imagine a settled solution to the problems of Northern Ire-land - or certainly not one that could be in place this century. There is, however, a faint chance, a sliver of hope, that the cycle of violence may be brought to an end somewhat sooner than that. This hope has been kept alive, even nurtured, by the weekend storm over the government's back-channel contacts with the IRA. Let us take each of these propositions in turn. The first tells us why the news from the six provinces is always so doleful. There is not space enough, nor time, to go through the long history that led to the establishment of the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland on the same island. The elusiveness of a solution to the consequent troubles is sufficiently demonstrated by reminding ourselves that the Protestants are a separate tribe from the Catholics. There is a sad record of mutual hostility. You have only to read republican literature, or see the anger in the face of the Reverend Ian Paisley, the Buthelezi of Belfast, to appreciate that. No arrangement that completely satisfies the one tribe will be acceptable to the other. Establishing a united Ireland tomorrow might create a new Bosnia in its north-eastern quarter. So might a unilateral withdrawal of troops; likewise the creation of a quasi-independent state of Ulster, followed by the relieved turning of John Bull's back on the lot of them. Fully incorporating Northern Ireland into mainland British institutions would not bring peace from the republican side. Going back to the use of internment of known terrorists would at best deliver only a temporary respite from the killing. It did not work last time, and would not again. Wiping out the opposing terrorist groups is not an option for a liberal democracy. In short, there is no military solution, and no plausible political solution. This might appear to invalidate the proposition that there may be a way to end the violence. Yet by all accounts Ulster is war-weary. There is a strong desire for peace. This is recorded in many opinion polls and has recently been made clear in statements and marches on both sides of the border. Partly for this reason, and partly as a result of a perhaps over-optimistic reading of intelligence gathered from and about the IRA, the British government has perceived an opportunity. We do not know precisely when this shaft of light struck Whitehall, but the documents released yesterday suggest that it was in February this year, or possibly earlier. The government took its chance, and launched the peace initiative that was nearly destroyed by Sunday's news that it has been in communication with the IRA. No one can be happy at hearing that ministers have failed to be wholly open and frank about their actions, particularly when political honesty is in such short supply. That said, it can hardly be denied that Mr John Major and Sir Patrick Mayhew were correct to use an intermediary to explore, supposedly in secret, the possibility of a ceasefire by the Irish Republican Army. The fact that they did so was heavily disguised by protestations that they were not negotiating with terrorists. Nor were they, but nobody with any sense would have assumed that there was no means of communicating with the opposing forces. All that has happened over the past few days is that the prime minister and the Northern Ireland secretary have been caught using weasel words in a worthwhile cause. It looks as if they have got away with it, and rightly so. Rightly? Forget, just for the moment, about Mr Major's weak points. His peace initiative is too important to be stopped in its tracks by the unserious custom of finding fault with his motives, or his methods or, alas too often, his results. Admittedly his score in all three areas is less than perfect. Mr Major's attempt to find a formula that brings peace may be founded on the ignoble proposition that, if he pulls this one off, his reputation will be restored. His method, that of the whip, has involved at best verbal acrobatics - and at worst statements that do not convey the whole truth. It is evident that the balancing act that gave so much hope last week nearly came unstuck this week; the curse of our butterfingers prime minister may be that much of what he touches seems to fall through his fingers. Yet the potential prize, a cessation of the random killings of innocent civilians, is too valuable to be lost by reminding ourselves of one politician's negative characteristics. It took courage for Mr Major to assume personal responsibility for negotiating a settlement. Cynics will point out, yesterday's documents in hand, that he had reason to believe that a ceasefire was about to be announced by the IRA. This does not materially diminish the political risk he took. As we can see, the IRA is not easily pinned down, and it was always possible that the veil of secrecy would be sundered. That is what has now occurred. It has not destroyed the government. Conservatives united behind the prime minister yesterday, in itself a striking indication of the ripeness of the time for his peace initiative. Mr James Molyneaux, leader of the larger Unionist party, cemented his alliance with the government by opening his remarks with the observation that Labour's spokesman on Northern Ireland speaks for Mr Gerry Adams, leader of Sinn Fein. Labour has held its hand, knowing the penalty for appearing to jeopardise the chances of peace. Thus fortified, Mr Major will press on. The back-channels will be used again, if necessary. The IRA may have been given an overdose of what Lady Thatcher called 'the oxygen of publicity'; it should now announce the permanent ceasefire that the government repeatedly calls for in the published documents. The Protestant paramilitaries should do likewise. There is no reason not to, so long as the government is committed to giving the voters of Northern Ireland the power to decide on any arrangement that may be made about their future. There may be no obvious political settlement of this tribal conflict, but at least getting everyone to lay down their guns and rely on negotiation and the democratic process would bring a period of respite. Ireland's history suggests that the odds are strongly against success. Mr Major may fail. Yet he is right to carry on, secret communication links and all.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

The Pounds 24m plan, which is being backed by the Industrial Development Board, will result in 400 jobs and a purpose-built factory at Magherafelt in south Londonderry. The announcement is particularly timely as the town was devastated by an IRA bomb earlier this year. That followed the closure of two large factories last year. The investment programme will also add 200 new jobs and improve the efficiency of the company's existing Northern Ireland plants. The company currently employs 2,700 in 11 factories across the province. Mr Robert Atkins, Northern Ireland's economy minister, said: 'The fact that most of the investment is going to Magherafelt is good news for a town which has suffered a number of setbacks in the last year. 'Growing demand for Desmond ladieswear - such as shorts and pyjamas - is the largest single reason for the new investment throughout the group.' Mr Clinton Silver, deputy chairman of Marks and Spencer, Desmond's main customer, said the company's ability to compete successfully against international competition was a clear indication of how M and S regarded the company's ability to work to world-class standards. Desmond has bought the former Coats Vyella factory in Magherafelt which it will use for pilot production while the new plant is built on a site near the town. Mr Denis Desmond, company chairman, said: 'The new investment programme forms a core of our current five-year strategy.

Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, was expected to use a meeting with Mr James Molyneaux, leader of the Ulster Unionist party, to set out ideas for a political settlement between Ulster's constitutional parties, as he promised earlier this month. It was also thought he might ask the UUP to postpone publication of its own proposals - understood to involve little more than the establishment of devolved government in Northern Ireland - until after the party conference later this month of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing. London and Dublin are anxious to deprive Republican leaders of any excuse before this conference for rejecting December's Downing Street Declaration by the British and Irish governments. President Bill Clinton yesterday reiterated his support for the joint declaration and the efforts 'in that context' of the British and Irish prime ministers, during a 30-minute telephone conversation with Mr John Major. The conversation coincided with news that Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, is to be invited to make a second visit to the US to head a St Patrick's Day parade through San Francisco. A recent 48-hour trip by Mr Adams to New York caused friction in UK-US relations. While Sir Patrick and Mr Molyneaux were meeting last night it emerged that a planned Northern Ireland select committee at Westminster is caught in party squabbling about its composition. Labour - currently waging a procedural war against the government - is pressing for four of its MPs to join a 13-member committee and for one of them to serve as chairman. The government wants the number of Labour MPs restricted to two. The bilateral talks with the province's constitutional parties continue later this week with a meeting between Sir Patrick and Dr John Alderdice, leader of the non-sectarian Alliance party. No date has been set for a meeting with the mainly Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party. The hardline Democratic Unionists are boycotting the talks process. Both leading unionist parties were irritated by Sir Patrick's decision to provide Dublin with details of the ideas he would like to be pursued before they were informed of them.

The fund, which already has the confidence of the US and of European Union nations, would provide a ready-made conduit for much of the promised additional money. It was set up in 1986 by the governments of the US and the Irish Republic and has now established itself as an engine for improvement. Until recently US budget cuts meant the fund faced a reduction in the annual contribution voted to it by the US Congress. At the beginning of August, however, the sum was again fixed at Pounds 13m and the figure could now be raised several times over. Since 1989 the EU has contributed Ecu15m (Pounds 12m) a year. The fund, whose total available resources by the end of last year stood at Pounds 225m, was established by the two governments to promote economic and social advance both in Northern Ireland and in the six border counties in the south. It is also charged with encouraging 'contact, dialogue and reconciliation' between nationalists and unionists throughout Ireland. Last year it helped create more than 2,600 jobs. Although the US and the EU have been among the principal sources of its finance, the fund has also been supported by Canada and New Zealand. The board of the fund is appointed jointly by the Irish and British governments and operations are controlled by joint directors-general based in Belfast and Dublin. Much of the day-to-day work, however, is carried out on the fund's behalf by government departments and agencies. The organisation, which has laid great emphasis on its independent status in order to give it credibility, has acted as a catalyst in encouraging economic regeneration in many of the most disadvantaged areas. It provides seed funding to stimulate public and private-sector investment and also encourages self-help schemes to bring together alienated communities. Particular efforts have been made to promote cross-border projects. These, together with additional help programmes in inner-city areas, could be significantly expanded. There have already been a series of 'flagship' cross-border projects, such as the Shannon-Erne waterway. Aid also goes to creating community-based businesses, developing science and technology and tourism. The EU has already allocated Ecu1.23bn in structural aid to Northern Ireland for 1994-99, up from Ecu1.07bn in 1989-93, mostly to develop infrastructure, training schemes, research and development and small businesses. Under a separate programme, the EU intends to spend a further Ecu100m on improving frontier links between the north and the republic.   Countries:-  IEZ  Ireland, EC.

'We're getting somewhere,' he said as he left the Stormont parliament building. However, morale about Northern Ireland's political future was low as stalemate continued over a logistical detail that has delayed the talks. After a further 6 1/2 hours of bilateral meetings with Mr Brooke, leaders of the main nationalist and unionist parties failed to agree on the venue for the Irish government's entry into the talks process. The dispute underlines the mistrust between the two communities in the province. Neither wants to be seen as giving way first. Discussions are still at the 'talks about talks' stage. Only nine weeks remain before the deadline for the completion of talks, with discussions on the complex subjects of devolution in the province and a new Anglo-Irish Agreement still to start. Ministers believe no side will want the talks to collapse on what seems a trivial issue.  The Financial Times   London Page 8  "
0,FT943-5532 ,"FT943-5532 _AN-EIDAYAA6FT 940903   FT  03 SEP 94 / Pro-unionist MPs flex their muscles: Tory right      By DAVID OWEN   For the moment they are mainly content to keep a watchful and suspicious eye on the progress of the UK-Irish peace initiative. But if events turn sour - as many of them fear they will - their misgivings could burst damagingly into the open. The large pro-unionist contingent in Conservative ranks will continue to exert a strong influence over Mr John Major in the aftermath of this week's open-ended IRA ceasefire. The need to ensure their tacit acceptance of the direction of government policy will be among the main factors shaping the prime minister's words and deeds in coming weeks. One area in which the views of the pro-unionist grouping could quickly influence the government's strategy is the vexed issue of whether the IRA ceasefire is permanent. Mr Jim Cran, Tory MP for Beverley, yesterday urged the government to take a hard line, saying ministers should insist that Sinn Fein uses the phrase 'a permanent renunciation of violence' in its amplifications of the IRA statement. 'All we have . . . is a sort of armistice,' Mr Cran added. In practice most Conservatives would probably fall into line once Mr James Molyneaux, the Ulster Unionist party leader, let it be known that he was satisfied that the cessation of IRA violence was for good. Many pro-unionists still hold profound reservations about the prospect of government officials holding bilateral talks with Sinn Fein representatives. Earlier this week Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, said in a pamphlet written before the ceasefire that the country 'should be spared the sight of ministers of the Crown or their representatives sitting around the same table as men who until three months before were bombing our fellow countrymen'. Mr Lamont is expected to return to the subject of Ulster in a newspaper article this weekend. Ms Lisl Biggs-Davison, trustee of the Friends of the Union under whose imprimatur Mr Lamont's pamphlet appeared, said she would be 'terribly reluctant' for the government to talk with Sinn Fein. 'I want to know what will happen to the people who have carried out those terrible crimes,' she said. If pro-unionists do decide to make public their reservations about the course of events, next month's Conservative party conference will provide the perfect opportunity. Not only is there a debate on Northern Ireland, but a series of events is planned on the conference fringe. One pro-unionist said this week that Northern Ireland was destined to be 'the big issue in Bournemouth'. The expectation among most Tories is that unless the peace initiative goes badly off the rails Mr Major and Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, are set to be applauded to the rafters for trying to end the violence. But the strength of the Tory pro-unionist faction should not be underestimated. The backbench Northern Ireland committee is firmly in pro-unionist hands, under the low-key but effective chairmanship of Mr Andrew Hunter, the MP for Basingstoke. Its influence in cabinet has also increased markedly with the promotion of Viscount Cranborne, leader of the Lords, and Mr Jonathan Aitken, chief Treasury secretary, in the recent reshuffle.

0,FT944-9584 ,"FT944-9584 _AN-EKOENADWFT 941115   FT  15 NOV 94 / Survival of Irish coalition comes under growing threat      By JOHN MURRAY BROWN   The survival of Ireland's Fianna Fail-led coalition government was under increasing threat last night, with senior government officials predicting its collapse. The crisis throws fresh doubt over the future pace of the Northern Ireland peace process. As Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, was outlining proposals to bring Ulster's loyalist groups into the talks process in a speech at the Lord Mayor's banquet, Mr Albert Reynolds, his Irish counterpart, was preparing for a parliamentary showdown today with his Labour party partners. The crisis, triggered by Labour's opposition to Mr Reynolds' proposed appointment of Mr Harry Whelehan, the attorney-general, as president of the High Court, looks certain to end the 22-month coalition. Mr Reynolds was in consultation with his Fianna Fail ministers yesterday. If the crisis is unresolved and Mr Reynolds loses a vote of no confidence he could seek the permission of Mrs Mary Robinson, the Irish president, to dissolve parliament, and call early elections. Alternatively, and some political observers believed this more likely yesterday, Mrs Robinson could ask the opposition parties to form a government with Labour. Mrs Robinson is understood to have taken legal advice yesterday. The prospective collapse of the Dublin government threatens to halt progress on the joint framework document being negotiated by the UK and Irish governments for a durable political settlement in Northern Ireland. But in a remark hinting at the possible break-up of the coalition, Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister and Labour leader, said: 'The momentum towards peace this opportunity offers as a prospect is beyond attack by any form of government or political party.' After a meeting with Mr Spring in Dublin yesterday, Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, indicated that progress had been made, although he refused to be drawn on a date for completion of the framework document. The UK government aims to start exploratory talks with loyalist political representatives before the end of the year, Mr Major announced yesterday. Speaking in London, he confirmed that the government was ready to begin talks with Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, by the end of the year. His remarks were welcomed across the political divide in Ulster. Mr Seamus Mallon, deputy leader of the moderate nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party, said: 'These talks should happen as quickly as possible so that the preliminary elements can be dealt with.' However, Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, described Mr Major's speech as 'wholly inadequate' and attacked him for 'still talking about talks'.

0,FT944-10830 ,"FT944-10830 _AN-EKIEIACDFT 941109   FT  09 NOV 94 / Peace process flies free of jails issue: Dublin's IRA prisoner release announcement      By DAVID OWEN, STEWART DALBY and JIMMY BURNS   Dublin's announcement that it intended to release several IRA prisoners before Christmas sparked a critical reaction yesterday from unionists and some Conservatives. But there seemed little prospect of the move blowing the Northern Ireland peace process off course. British and Irish officials working on the framework document, which the two governments hope will form the basis of a durable political settlement in the province, are understood to be making headway again after a period when little progress was achieved. The recent suggestion by Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, that the much-delayed document should be ready before the first anniversary of the signing of the Downing Street declaration on December 15 does not seem to be regarded as unrealistic in Whitehall. Mr Reynolds and Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, would have an opportunity to discuss the matter at the European Union summit in Essen, Germany, on December 9 and 10. More may become clear following a meeting between Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, and Mr Dick Spring, Irish foreign minister, which is expected to take place next Monday in Ireland. Meanwhile, there seems no reason to suppose that preliminary talks between the British government and Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, should not start before the end of the year, as Mr Major has indicated. Topics to be covered would include the dismantling of republican arsenals. The two governments disclosed last month that officials had started talks on the logistics and mechanics of arranging for weapons in the hands of paramilitaries to be given up. But Mr Major declined to say whether the handing over of weapons was likely to begin in advance of the preliminary talks. Unionist reaction to Monday night's announcement by Dublin was divided. The hardline Democratic Unionist party (DUP) referred to a 'secret agenda' under which London would agree to the IRA's demands. But the moderate Ulster Unionists (UUP) said they were worried about the 'increasing divergence' between London and Dublin. Mr Ian Paisley Jr, a DUP spokesman, said: 'The Irish government has behaved recklessly in announcing prisoner releases. It confirms what we have been saying all along. The British government is surrendering to the IRA and the republic.' Mr Ken Maginnis, UUP security spokesman, said: 'I do not think there is a two-handed conspiracy between Westminster and Dublin. Quite the reverse. I am worried about the increasing divergence between the two governments; between Ireland's piecemeal approach and Mr John Major's correct structured approach.' Mr David Trimble, UUP legal affairs spokesman, said: 'I think the prisoner releases underline the growing differences and widening gap between London and Dublin. Dublin is trying to put pressure on London over prisoners because London put pressure on Dublin over arms surrender.' Mr Andrew Hunter, chairman of the Tory backbench Northern Ireland committee, described the announcement as 'a serious miscalculation by the Irish government'. He said: 'The peace process can only maintain its momentum if it retains the confidence of both sides of a deeply divided community . . . this is the first incident which, if repeated, could spell trouble.' Mr Seamus Mallon, deputy leader of the mainly Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party, said the republic's decision did not mean arbitrary releases. He said: 'It is an approach which should be applied in Northern Ireland through review procedures so that as peace lasts, so the prison population decreases in a way which would signal a new era for Northern Ireland.' Downing Street emphasised yesterday that Dublin's policy on the release of prisoners in the Irish Republic had no implications for London's policy on convicted prisoners. It said it had repeatedly made clear that those convicted of criminal offences would serve their sentences. Dublin's move was widely seen as evidence of its concern to maintain the peace initiative's momentum in order to bolster moderate voices in the republican movement. According to security and republican sources, the Sinn Fe'in leadership is coming under increasing pressure from hardliners in the IRA to obtain significant political concessions from the British government. Restlessness is deepening among IRA volunteers in the rural areas of Armagh and Tyrone who feel that the peace process is bringing about no radical change in the British government's position on Northern Ireland. This section of the IRA is seeking an early release of political prisoners, a withdrawal of troops, and a commitment to united Ireland. The republic has 56 IRA prisoners in its jails compared with about 400 in British jails.   Countries:-  IEZ  Ireland, EC.   Industries:-  P9721 International Affairs.   Types:-  NEWS  General News.

0,FT923-1911 ,"FT923-1911 _AN-CIUDDABAFT 920921   FT  21 SEP 92 / Survey of Northern Ireland (1): Waving the olive branch - Present talks represent the first real hope of peace in years. But deepening recession and threat of spending cuts add to the sense of urgency      By TIM COONE   POLITICAL initiatives lie like burnt-out wrecks along the trail that has marked Northern Ireland's recent history. Twenty-three years of intractable sectarian conflict has left behind such a backlog of mistrust and fear that new ideas for bridging the gulf between the nationalist and unionist traditions in Northern Ireland have often been rejected out of hand before they have even had a hearing. But in April, for the first time since the 'troubles' began, the province's four main constitutional parties started facing each other at the negotiating table, with representatives from the British and Irish governments, to discuss substantive proposals for the future administrative structure for Northern Ireland. The complex three-strand negotiating process initiated then has created the first real hope in years that the elusive political settlement may finally be in the offing. The walk-out by the Democratic Unionist leaders at Stormont two weeks ago, however, has put a question mark over their likely presence in Dublin this week, where the talks are scheduled to resume today. The Rev Ian Paisley, the DUP leader, insists that the Irish government must first commit itself to reforming the Republic's constitution, dropping its legal territorial claim to Northern Ireland, before any progress can be made in other aspects of the negotiations. The Irish government, for its part, is proffering the carrot of constitutional reform to the Unionists, which would dilute the Republic's territorial claim to one of a mere 'aspiration' for Irish unity, but in return also wants guarantees that will protect the interests of the minority community in Northern Ireland. The nationalist Social Democratic Labour Party (SDLP) led by Mr John Hume, will be particularly anxious that any compromise on the Irish constitution must be compensated by a radical new government structure for the province, which will give Dublin some monitoring role in order to guard against any irredentism on the part of the Unionist majority. To date, the unionists have given few clues as to how they see the concerns of the nationalist community and the Irish government being addressed, or indeed that they are prepared to surrender any of their bargaining counters. That presumably will be tested soon. Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary of state, said that he has no wish to endanger the talks by putting undue pressure on the participants. 'I expect it to be a longer rather than a shorter process. It would be better to see a result rather than an abrupt halt. It will have a better chance of success if we allow people to sound off,' he said. However, there is concern in Dublin that the talks should not drag on indefinitely. Four cabinet ministers are in the Irish delegation, and are devoting most of their time to the talks - an indication of the importance Dublin attaches to the process. If no progress is made in the coming weeks, however, there could be a change of attitude, especially if simmering domestic crises should come to the boil. For its part, the UK government is showing signs of financial, if not political, fatigue with the Ulster question. In a speech earlier this month Mr Michael Mates, minister of state for finance and security in the province, said Northern Ireland would no longer be cushioned from the impact of spending cuts elsewhere in the country. 'There are firm constraints on public expenditure nationally and these are likely to be reflected in difficult decisions for all parts of the public sector. . . we in Northern Ireland cannot be excused our share of this misery'. It is an ominous warning. Some 40 per cent of employment in Northern Ireland comes from the public sector. It has been an important factor in Northern Ireland weathering the recession better than other parts of the country. Unemployment, already the highest regional rate in the UK, is rising, however, and independently forecast to exceed 16 per cent by 1994, even before any cuts. Economic experts are calling for radical new approaches to the economy. The government, however, appears to be going in the opposite direction. It is also going against the political grain in the province by pressing ahead with its plans for privatisation of public utilities against both nationalist and unionist opposition. The determination of the government to reduce Northern Ireland's strain on the Exchequer will undoubtedly encourage a growing number of politicians from both political persuasions to seek economic comfort in Brussels. Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, in its last Congress also noted that an EC dimension might form the basis of a political solution. Its leaders have also been making increasingly conciliatory statements towards the unionists in recent months. The defeat of Mr Gerry Adams in the West Belfast constituency at the last general elections is indicative that Sinn Fein's star is on the wane, and is pushing the organisation towards a more moderate and conciliatory stance. From the other end of the spectrum, Sir Patrick Mayhew is emphatic when he says: 'The British government does not have a selfish motive for staying here. It does not have a special interest of its own to serve . . . The more people understand that is the way we look at it, the harder it will be for the IRA to win support.' He still rules out talks with Sinn Fein, however. 'When there is palpable evidence on the ground that they have renounced and denounced violence for political purposes, then we will have a new situation,' he said. The fact that the Ulster Defence Association (UDA), the cover organisation for the Loyalist paramilitaries of the UFF, was proscribed last month, and Sinn Fein was not, is nonetheless being interpreted as a signal to Sinn Fein that the door has not been closed to their eventual inclusion in the talks. The substantive concessions from all sides which will be necessary for progress have thus still to be made, but the fact that negotiations have begun at all suggests that a rethink of old dogmas may be under way. According to Mr Robin Wilson, the editor of Fortnight magazine in Belfast, who through his publication has done much to draw attention to the merits of an EC dimension in any settlement, 'it will be a question of redefining nationalism and unionism in a European context'. Whether that imaginative road will be chosen, remains to be seen. It will be a difficult and politically risky process for all involved, but the price of past failure by Northern Ireland's politicians is already there to be seen - the bomb-damaged buildings of Belfast and a grisly death toll of 3,000 since 1969.

For much of that time this was due to the Dickson and McGredy families growing and breeding roses there. Even when Sam McGredy transferred all his rose breeding to New Zealand, the stream of fine new roses from Northern Ireland continued to flow from Pat Dickson. Something about the climate here and maybe also about the soil seems specially favourable for roses; an equability of temperature combined with an abundance of atmospheric moisture that seems to give rose blossoms a little extra quality and clarity of colour. Maybe there is an element of sentiment in this view but I have heard many rose experts express it. In 1964 the Rose Society of Northern Ireland was founded as a totally separate organisation and in 1981 the RSNI was accepted as a member of the World Federation of Rose Societies. The appropriate reward is that, this year, the World Federation has chosen Northern Ireland as the country to host its ninth World Rose Convention and has arranged a very full and attractive programme of events to be held before, during and after the Convention under the title Rose Emerald 1991. The Convention itself will take place in Belfast between Monday July 15 and Sunday July 21 and will be centred in Queen's University where there will be lectures and exhibitions. Two rose shows will be staged here exclusively for new roses exhibited by international rose breeders and two more shows will be for both new and old roses. Since 1965 the city of Belfast Rose trials have been held in the Sir Thomas and Lady Dixon Park and are judged every year by an international panel of rose experts. Rose Emerald 1991 is timed to coincide with the closing stages of this year's judging of these ongoing trials and there will be a conducted tour of them for convention delegates. Other visits and tours have been arranged for Convention Week: a civic reception hosted by Belfast City Council at City Hall, Belfast; a Government Reception at Greenmount College, Antrim; a gala banquet at Europa Hotel, Belfast; an Irish night in association with the Industrial Development Board of Northern Ireland, also at the Europa Hotel; and a Gala Concert in association with Ulster Television. Among the tours arranged during the convention is one to Mount Stewart House and Gardens which I would specially recommend for this is a remarkable place; a fine 18th century mansion with a very large garden much of which was planned and planted after 1920 by the Seventh Marchioness of Londonderry. It is highly original in design, very beautiful and contains a number of unusual plants. July is an excellent month to see it. It is also a good time to see many other gardens and the organisers of Rose Emerald 1991 have taken advantage of this to plan three tours, one to take place the week before the convention and two more the week following it. The first of these will start in London on Sunday July 7 and travel northwards visiting the Royal National Rose Society's large display garden and trial grounds near St Albans and finishing in Glasgow on July 15 in good time to get to Belfast the following day. Among the gardens to be visited on the way are Blenheim Palace, Chatsworth House, Harlow Carr, which is the garden of the Northern Horticultural Society, and the Royal Botanic Garden, Edinburgh. After the convention delegates can return for a further four days min England, starting at Kew Gardens on Monday, July 22 and then spending a whole day at the Royal National Rose Society's garden at St Albans, another day in the Royal Horticultural Society's garden at Wisley and then a day in Oxford with a further opportunity to look at Blenheim Palace and its strongly contrasted formal and landscape gardens. The alternative, post-convention tour is in southern Ireland, starting and finishing in Dublin and lasting a week from July 22 to 28. The gardens to be visited include the spectacular Powerscourt among the Wicklow Mountains and also a unique Japanese Garden at Tully House, Kildare. It also includes much of the finest south western coastal scenery and passes through Glengarriff from which launches ply to tiny Garinish Island entirely filled by a superb garden partly in Italian style, and with dramatic scenery but one that has never acquired the mansion that was originally planned for it.

U.S. MAGISTRATE SAYS SHE ISN'T LIKELY TO FLEE.      By DARRELL DAWSEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER      A federal magistrate set bail at $25,000 Monday for an Irish activist charged  with lying to U.S. immigration officials about a 1985 conviction in Northern  Ireland on charges of possessing explosives.    In setting bail for Siobhan O'Hanlon, U.S. Magistrate Charles F. Eick said the  Irish national, arrested by FBI agents Thursday in Whittier, has enough ties in  Los Angeles County to prevent her from fleeing the country before her trial.    She is charged with failing to disclose the explosives conviction on  immigration forms she filled out in New York City last month.    Eick said the nature of the charges ""militates heavily against detaining the  defendant."" He also postponed until Thursday a hearing on whether O'Hanlon's  trial will be moved to New York.    The magistrate said much of his decision to grant bail was based on commitments  from members of the local Irish-American community to offer their homes as  collateral for the bond. At least 10 couples have offered their homes, said  immigration attorney Peter Schey.    FBI agents arrested O'Hanlon as she arrived at the Sprinkler Fitters' Union  headquarters for a speech to members of the Irish Northern Aid Committee.    O'Hanlon spent two years in prison in Northern Ireland after her 1985  conviction on the explosives charges.    O'Hanlon came to this country last month to speak before the Irish American  Unity Conference, a coalition of groups seeking an end to the fighting between  the British government and Irish activists in Northern Ireland.    ""She came to address the conference and then she traveled around the country,""  said Imelda Hughes, a member of the Irish Northern Aid Committee and one of the  homeowners who offered to put up her house to meet the bond payment. ""I know  her off and on, but I'm not about to put up my house for anyone who would skip  town.""    Hughes said O'Hanlon's arrest has galvanized -- and angered -- many in the  local Irish-American community.    ""It totally incensed Irish-Americans,"" she said. ""People born in Belfast know  they get no justice, but people born here thought they did. (The arrest) came  as a big shock to them.""

U.S. MAGISTRATE SAYS SHE ISN'T LIKELY TO FLEE.      By DARRELL DAWSEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER      A federal magistrate set bail at $25,000 Monday for an Irish activist charged  with lying to U.S. immigration officials about a 1985 conviction in Northern  Ireland on charges of possessing explosives.    In setting bail for Siobhan O'Hanlon, U.S. Magistrate Charles F. Eick said the  Irish national, arrested by FBI agents Thursday in Whittier, has enough ties in  Los Angeles County to prevent her from fleeing the country before her trial.    She is charged with failing to disclose the explosives conviction on  immigration forms she filled out in New York City last month.    Eick said the nature of the charges ""militates heavily against detaining the  defendant."" He also postponed until Thursday a hearing on whether O'Hanlon's  trial will be moved to New York.    The magistrate said much of his decision to grant bail was based on commitments  from members of the local Irish-American community to offer their homes as  collateral for the bond. At least 10 couples have offered their homes, said  immigration attorney Peter Schey.    FBI agents arrested O'Hanlon as she arrived at the Sprinkler Fitters' Union  headquarters for a speech to members of the Irish Northern Aid Committee.    O'Hanlon spent two years in prison in Northern Ireland after her 1985  conviction on the explosives charges.    O'Hanlon came to this country last month to speak before the Irish American  Unity Conference, a coalition of groups seeking an end to the fighting between  the British government and Irish activists in Northern Ireland.    ""She came to address the conference and then she traveled around the country,""  said Imelda Hughes, a member of the Irish Northern Aid Committee and one of the  homeowners who offered to put up her house to meet the bond payment. ""I know  her off and on, but I'm not about to put up my house for anyone who would skip  town.""    Hughes said O'Hanlon's arrest has galvanized -- and angered -- many in the  local Irish-American community.    ""It totally incensed Irish-Americans,"" she said. ""People born in Belfast know  they get no justice, but people born here thought they did. (The arrest) came  as a big shock to them.""    O'Hanlon has spoken in several cities since addressing the Irish American Unity  Conference, including San Diego and San Francisco.

They met after Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams offered what  sounded like new hope of ending the sectarian slaughter, saying  he was convinced a settlement would come out of the peace  process.    He indicated there would be a Sinn Fein response to the  Downing Street declaration of December 15 after the June 9  European elections.    However, there were the first signs today that Sinn Fein,  the  IRA's political wing, is suffering internal tensions over its  approach.    Members critical of the leadership were accused of trying to  damage the peace process.    Mr. Adams told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I am quite  convinced that what is going to come out of this peace process  is a peace settlement -- I am quite convinced about it. It is a  significant step.    ""It is part of one of those steps which are required to  advance the peace process. It addresses some of the core issues  and it dismisses some of the other questions.""    He said the fact that the British Government had responded  to  Sinn Fein's list of questions about the Downing Street  declaration was in itself ""very significant"".    Meanwhile, Mr. Major and Mr. Reynolds were meeting against a  background of continuing terrorist violence.    Prime aim of their discussions was to consider the reaction  to a detailed British response a week ago to Sinn Fein's request  for clarification of their peace declaration.    But persistent gun and bomb attacks in Northern Ireland and,  last weekend, in the Irish Republic -- when Ulster Loyalist  paramilitaries shot an IRA man in a Dublin bar -- ensured that  security issues would remain high on the agenda for tonight's  exchanges.    The two leaders were also due to assess progress made by  officials from their two governments towards establishing a  framework for resuming all-party cross-border talks on Ulster's  future. Those discussions stalled near the end of 1992 after a  series of disagreements.    Since then, Northern Ireland Office ministers have been  involved in behind-the-scenes meetings with party officials in a  bid to kick-start the talks process.    Meetings between officials are thought to have made advances  towards a timetable for beginning the inter-party discussions  again. But it is thought likely to be the end of the summer  before meaningful talks get under way.     "

""I remain convinced that the IRA is willing to deal  positively with any new eventuality. It is clear that the IRA  is interested in developing the search for peace,"" he told a St  Patrick's Day gathering in west Belfast.    What was required was a change in government policy.  ""Building peace may be messy and continually tragic and  confused. It may be slow and circuitous,"" he said in an  apparent reference to IRA mortar attacks on Heathrow and the  murder of a RUC (Royal Ulster Constabulary) officer last week.    Identifying the source of all the violence as the continuing  Anglo-Irish conflict, Mr Adams said it was the Government which  held the key to progress. It was time for the realism displayed  during the negotiations over Britain's disengagement from  Zimbabwe ""to be shown again in relation to their longterm  intentions in Ireland.""    He had no doubt that the opportunity for peace remained.  ""For  all of us the prospect is at the same time exciting and  frightening. It's a very dangerous time in our history."" Making  peace with one's enemies and opponents was a very difficult  business. ""We must expect set-backs, disappointments and  diversions, but we are determined that when and if these arise  we will overcome them.""    Mr Adams struck a significantly softer tone than in his  keynote speech at Sinn Fein's annual conference last month, when  he called Northern Ireland's Unionist majority an Irish national  minority. Partition had no longer failed, but had retarded, the  development of democracy in Ireland.    ""It is my firm conviction that Unionists can be persuaded to  recognise that they share a common peaceful destiny with their  fellow countrymen and women in the common territory of Ireland,""  he said. It was obvious that the Government's role as persuader  was key to this. But, ""we in Sinn Fein, who profess to be  anti-sectarian and secular, have a duty to develop our contacts  with the Unionist community. We must reconise, be sympathetic  and sensitive to what Unionists are being asked to consider and  commit themselves to, if a peace dialogue is to develop.    ``I am calling on nationalists and republicans to be aware  of  what it means to be a Unionist as this century draws to a  close.'' There was also a need for Unionists to seek  clariflcation of the Government's longterm intentions in  Ireland. It was ironic that Unionists and nationalists shared a  common distrust of the Government.    The remarks may have been directed at U.S. opinion, which  appears to be hardening against the IRA as Albert Reynolds, the  Irish leader, visits Washington seeking support for the Downing  Street Declaration.    House of Representatives Speaker Tom Foley, a leading  Irish-American politician, conceded that the United States had  been wrong to grant Mr Adams a visa this year.    In the Commons Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Ulster Secretary  said:  ""The best hope for peace is that Sinn Fein realise that violence  is going to get them nowhere.""    Sir Patrick, during Northern Ireland questions, came under  pressure from his own backbenchers for a security crackdown, and  from the Ulster Unionist leader James Molyneaux to shelve  discussions on possible cross-border institutions during the  present round of bilateral talks with the constitutional  parties. Mr Molyneaux said the parties should instead  concentrate on agreeing a devolved assembly in Northern Ireland.    David Trimble, Ulster Unionist MP for Upper Bann, told Sir  Patrick to stop using the Downing Street Declaration as an  excuse for failing to press ahead with talks on devolved  government for Northern Ireland.    Although Sir Patrick said he would not uncouple the socalled  Strand One talks on devolution from the other two Strands  (cross-border institutions and relations between the two  governments) Ulster Unionists are privately hopeful that in  practice the current round of talks will be restricted to Strand  One.    Members of the Northern Ireland backbench committee are to  visit the RUC shortly to study the problem of co-operation with  the Garda over border security.     "

The meeting follows a renewed surge of violence by both the IRA and loyalist paramilitaries in Northern Ireland, and a failed but potentially devastating bomb attack in Dublin last weekend by the loyalist Ulster Volunteer Force. Dublin officials said that tomorrow's meeting had been arranged before the upsurge in violence, to coincide with other functions the Irish prime minister has planned in London and Oxford. New security measures are expected to include additional police checkpoints on roads north of Dublin and leading from the border. Police and army chiefs were in talks throughout yesterday and the army said that additional troops 'will be available to support the Gardai as required'. Up to 2,000 of Ireland's 13,000 troops are deployed on border security duties at any one time, supported by helicopters, spotter planes and bomb-disposal teams. On average some 35 checkpoints on border roads are manned by army personnel every day, and more than 30 patrols per day are carried out along the border. Any movements of commercial explosives - from the time they enter the country to their moment of detonation - are escorted and monitored by army personnel. Yesterday, Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, sought to emphasise that next month's European election should not be treated in the province as a referendum on the Downing Street Declaration. Launching the Conservative party manifesto in Belfast, Sir Patrick said the election mattered because it was about 'our jobs and our identity'. He said Britain's opt-out from the 'suffocating' social chapter of the Maastricht treaty meant more jobs for Ulster, a region plagued by high unemployment.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

At one moment Irish ministers stood shoulder-to-shoulder with their British counterparts, insisting that there would be no concessions to Sinn Fein without a permanent IRA ceasefire. At the next they appeared to change tack. Having signed the Downing Street declaration in December, the Irish republic lifted its broadcasting ban on Sinn Fein in January and then made various direct and indirect communications to Sinn Fein to spell out its interpretation of the joint declaration. Dublin has insisted that no deadlines will be put on Sinn Fein's acceptance or rejection of the declaration. Last weekend, Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, said a temporary ceasefire by the IRA would be 'welcome'. So is Dublin undermining the joint declaration? Or is it that the Irish government's recent manoeuvrings are simply a translation into politics of two of the country's favourite pastimes - horse-racing and fly-fishing? Mr Albert Reynolds, the prime minister, is a keen racegoer and has a reputation as a man prepared to take a gamble in politics. With the joint declaration he has in effect studied the form, checked the going, and placed his bet that Sinn Fein and the IRA will eventually renounce violence and enter the negotiating process. Meanwhile, with the skills and patience of a fly-fisherman, he has repeatedly cast his vision of Ireland's future past the suspicious eyes of the North's republicans. He changes the 'fly' to suit the latest shifts in wind or weather, but always with the same intention - to catch the biggest fish in the history of the Irish state, an end to the IRA's military campaign and the prize of peace in Northern Ireland. One prominent Northern Ireland politician said recently: 'Sinn Fein is like a salmon on a hook. It darts this way and that and puts up a tremendous struggle to escape. But if you play it in gently, you will eventually land it.' Dublin has made no secret of its view that any efforts to renew political talks in Northern Ireland are likely to founder without an end to the IRA military campaign. It has therefore spared no effort to explain to Sinn Fein's leaders both Dublin's and London's understanding of the joint declaration, and of the steps that will follow an end to violence. According to government officials, those contacts continue through intermediaries. One said: 'The Taoiseach (prime minister) speaks to someone who then speaks to someone.' Senior Irish government officials say in private that Mr Reynolds believes the British government could take similar steps to bring about an IRA ceasefire without entering into negotiations or making concessions. Dublin's latest cast is to emphasise that Sinn Fein does not have to accept the Downing Street declaration as such, but that a permanent end to the IRA military campaign would be sufficient to admit Sinn Fein to what is seen as the next phase of the peace process - the establishment of a Forum of Peace and Reconciliation in the republic. The forum was referred to in the joint declaration as a specifically Dublin initiative, bringing together the nationalist parties of north and south to work out a common platform from which to negotiate with the unionists and the British government. Other parties would subsequently be invited to attend. It is unrealistic in Dublin's view to impose a precondition on Sinn Fein to accept the declaration (other than the essential condition that the IRA abandon its military campaign) when it has already been declared moribund by the Ulster Unionist party and rejected out of hand by the Democratic Unionist party. In Northern Ireland it has been welcomed only by the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party and the moderate Alliance party. In a recent interview with a Belfast newspaper Mr Reynolds said: 'Let (the declaration) be a vehicle for a cessation of violence. If some people in the republican movement have problems with some of the words in it that's fine. That should not be a reason for staying away.' Mr Reynolds and Mr Spring have since insisted that a temporary ceasefire will not be sufficient to admit Sinn Fein to the talks process, especially as the IRA does not seem to be considering one. That particular 'fly' has been put away for the moment, it seems, but it should not come as a surprise if Dublin casts a few new ones across Northern Ireland's troubled waters in the weeks ahead, as it waits patiently for Sinn Fein to bite.

0,FT941-11647 ,"FT941-11647 _AN-EBCDJADWFT 940203   FT  03 FEB 94 / The FT Interview: Long haul across Ulster's quagmire - Sir Patrick Mayhew      By PHILIP STEPHENS and MICHAEL CASSELL   The stage this week has been held by Mr Gerry Adams. His visit to New York was a formidable coup for the man who has long cultivated an image as the respectable face of IRA terrorism. The often naive questions from the US television interviewers who feted the president of Sinn Fein during his 48-hour trip were a gift to such an accomplished propagandist. So if the public reaction of the UK government to President Bill Clinton's decision to grant Mr Adams a visa has been restrained, the private anger has been real. Efforts to end the conflict in Northern Ireland do not sit easily alongside appeasement of Irish-Americans in Boston and New York. In any event Mr Adams's US trip has done nothing to change the realities of a conflict which has claimed more than 3,000 lives in 25 years. Even as he was appealing in New York for 'peace', the IRA fired a 150lb mortar bomb at British troops. Nobody was killed. But it will not be long before the bombs and bullets - from loyalist as well as republican paramilitaries - add more names to the death roll. Sitting in his elegant office in Belfast's Stormont Castle, Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, was concerned with these realities. In an hour-long interview he insisted the Anglo-Irish declaration signed in December by Mr John Major and Mr Albert Reynolds, the British and Irish prime ministers, would in the end provide the basis for durable peace. Sir Patrick refused to speculate publicly on the odds of an early end to the violence, but he gave the impression of a man preparing for the long haul. Intelligence reports on his desk almost certainly confirm the competing doves and hawks in the IRA have decided for the time being to put internal unity ahead of peace. Sir Patrick's message was that, whatever the IRA does in the short term, the joint principles laid down in the declaration are inviolable. The two governments had spelt out that Ulster could not be coerced into a united Ireland. Nor would Britain take on the role of a 'persuader' in seeking to break the province's links with the rest of the UK. But it would not stand in the way of Irish unity if that was ever the democratic wish of a majority in the north. As Sir Patrick put it: 'Each government has shown that it understands and accepts the validity of the aspirations of each side in the divided community . . . each government has agreed that the future of Northern Ireland will be decided by the wishes of the people living in Northern Ireland. And that is terribly important.' The republican charge that Britain is an imperialist power was no longer sustainable. Northern Ireland is no Gaza strip or Cyprus, where people are denied access to the ballot box. Despite Mr Clinton's decision this week, Sir Patrick is convinced that agreement between London and Dublin on the province's future will lead to progressive international isolation of the IRA. Meanwhile, the two governments would give impetus to efforts to reinstate devolved administration in Northern Ireland and to enhance co-operation between north and south. Sir Patrick will table within two weeks an outline plan for a new political settlement. The plan - to be presented to the Ulster Unionist party, the mainly-Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party and the non-sectarian Alliance party - will centre on a new devolved assembly in Ulster. It will also include proposals for a number of cross-border executive boards with responsibility for such areas as tourism and the environment. Rev Ian Paisley's hardline Democratic Unionist party will be invited back to the table. Together these proposals make up strands one and two of the so-called three-stranded search for a comprehensive political settlement. Strand three, as it is known, is concerned with updating the 1985 Anglo-Irish agreement between the two governments. Sir Patrick cleared up once and for all the government's position on Mr Adams's repeated demands for clarification, negotiation (call it what you will), of the Downing Street text. He will not get it. Mr Adams wanted a place at the table before the IRA had stopped its killing: 'It is entirely clear what he wants is a renegotiation of the declaration . . . And we are not going to do it.' There was 'a place and time for negotiation about the future of Northern Ireland - its status and everything else to do with it. That place and time is during the talks from which nobody is excluded except those who say: 'We wish actually to fortify our arguments with bombs''. Mr Adams knows it and, in Sir Patrick's judgment, is playing for time. Nor will a temporary truce do: 'The government will not negotiate with Adams or anyone else unless and until they have permanently ended violence or permanently ended the justification for violence. I have made that clear time and time again. So have the Irish. There is no daylight between us on this.' The reasoning is obvious: 'If you negotiate with people who want a united Ireland . . . in those circumstances (of continuing violence) it would undercut fatally other nationalist politicians who accept the disciplines of constitutional politics.' For other nationalist politicians you can substitute Mr John Hume, the SDLP leader. It is Mr Adams and his allies, not the British government, who have it within their power to bring peace. 'The right analogy seems to me to be this. Sinn Fein have the key. The key is this: their ability to give up violence . . . if they put it in the lock now and turn it, consequences follow which have been spelt out.' But either way the declaration will remain on the table: 'The lock is not going to be changed.' Nor will the two governments allow Sinn Fein to paralyse the search for a political settlement: 'The joint declaration is not a substitute for the (political) talks process. It complements it. But it is not a substitute for it.' So after months of tortuous negotiations, Sir Patrick will table what he calls a 'framework of ideas' to secure agreement among the province's constitutional parties on strands one and strand two. He is under no illusions that progress will be rapid: 'It's a delicate, slow, pragmatic process.' A previous attempt to secure agreement broke down in acrimony in 1992. For the time being at least the discussions will continue on a bilateral basis with each party. The moderate Ulster Unionists led by Mr James Molyneaux want a devolved assembly but they are not interested in enhanced co-operation with Dublin. The DUP, which walked out of the talks to protest against the joint declaration, has yet to agree even to join discussions. Mr Molyneaux must be kept on side. Mr John Major's government depends upon his support. So Sir Patrick is adamant that there can be nothing in strand two (structures for cross-border co-operation) which the unionists might condemn as representing joint authority between London and Dublin over affairs in the province. But the constitutional nationalists represented by Mr Hume are only interested in devolution if it is slotted into the context of much closer co-operation between North and South. They must be given something if they are to sign up to an assembly. And so on - the complexities and complications are endless. It will take months if not years to get within striking distance of an agreement. The whole process could yet founder on the prejudices and suspicions which scar the politics of Northern Ireland. Holding the present alliance with Dublin will not be easy if the IRA continues its campaign. But in Sir Patrick's view there is no other route. For all his success in New York, Mr Adams, identified as a dove in the IRA power struggle which has followed the Downing Street declaration, knows it.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

The Irish government forwarded to London a list of questions drawn up by Sinn Fein focusing on the declaration's treatment of self-determination, the so-called unionist 'veto' and Britain's long-term intentions in the province. The move constitutes a potentially significant climbdown by Sinn Fein, which had previously insisted on face-to-face meetings with government officials to discuss its reservations. London is expected to reply to the questions next week. Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, said last night in a statement that the government would publish Sinn Fein's text together with its own 'comments'. This would take place 'within a matter of days once we have had an opportunity to give them proper consideration'. It will raise hopes that republican leaders may be edging closer to declaring an end to their 25-year armed campaign, paving the way for Sinn Fein to enter the political talks process. London has emphasised repeatedly that Sinn Fein's demand for clarification had never been made specific since to do so would 'attract ridicule and scorn'. But Sir Patrick hinted last month to a US congressional committee that he would consider responding to specific queries. Unionists reacted cautiously to yesterday's development. Mr David Trimble, Ulster Unionist MP for Upper Bann, said Sir Patrick should send the questions back 'with the envelope unopened'. Dublin had 'persuaded the Provos to do this to keep the British on the hook'. Sinn Fein's move came after Sir Patrick had used a speech in Dublin to try to inject fresh urgency into the search for a lasting political settlement, saying an early end to direct rule in Ulster was needed. In a carefully balanced address, the Northern Ireland secretary said there was a clear role for 'new structures' to develop the relationship between the two parts of the island 'purposefully and profitably'. This meant certain assumptions would have to be made on the shape of democratic institutions in Northern Ireland but there was no need for these to impinge on sovereignty. He said London and Dublin were looking for a 'new and more broadly based' Anglo-Irish Agreement to replace the document agreed in 1985 that gave Dublin a say in Ulster affairs for the first time. Reaching a new agreement would mean 'all of us being prepared to embrace new ideas, new institutional structures and imaginative approaches to constitutional and human rights issues'.

0,FT934-16574 ,"FT934-16574 _AN-DJFC5AAWFT 931006   FT  06 OCT 93 / Irish opposition party leader resigns      By TIM COONE      DUBLIN   MR Des O'Malley has resigned as leader of the opposition Progressive Democrat party in Ireland, to 'make way for new blood'. He said he was under no political or personal pressure to do so. Mr O'Malley, 54, said he would stand for election one more time before quitting politics altogether. He did not say what his long-term plans were. A long-time opponent of Mr Charles Haughey within Fianna Fail, he split with the party leader in 1984, when Mr Haughey had him expelled for publicly differing with him on Northern Ireland, the contraception issue and internal party democracy. He founded the Progressive Democrats (PDs) in 1985, presenting it as the party of high standards and open government. The party has since had an influential minority voice holding the balance of power with six out of 166 Dail seats in the coalition government from 1989 to 1992. It was Mr O'Malley's decision to withdraw his party's support from Fianna Fail in January 1992, as a series of political and business scandals began to wash over Mr Haughey, then the prime minister, that precipitated Mr Haughey's resignation and the formation of a new Fianna Fail-PD coalition, under the leadership of Mr Albert Reynolds. Mr O'Malley has been one of the principal proponents of dropping the republic's constitutional claim to Northern Ireland and, as a member of the government negotiating team to the 'round-table' talks on the province during 1992, clashed with his Fianna Fail colleagues in the negotiations, who insist that any constitutional change should only be made as part of an overall settlement. He then fell out with Mr Reynolds over contrasting evidence the two men gave to the tribunal of inquiry into the beef industry between June and October of 1992. It was this disagreement which led to the collapse of the coalition and a general election.

0,FT932-9605 ,"FT932-9605 _AN-DEMB5ACCFT 930513   FT  13 MAY 93 / Regions give clearest sign yet of recovery      By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor   WALES, THE west Midlands and south-east England are leading manufacturing industry's recovery, says the latest regional trends survey from the Confederation of British Industry and the economic consultancy Business Strategies. The survey found that manufacturing output rose in seven of the UK's 11 regions in the four months to April while orders were higher in six of the regions. Orders rose sharply in Wales and the west Midlands with smaller rises reported in the south-east, Northern Ireland and north-west England. Mr Richard Holt, an associate director of Business Strategies, said the survey was 'the clearest signal yet that the recovery is here'. Manufacturers in all regions expect increased output and orders in the next four months. Companies in the west Midlands are the most optimistic about production prospects, followed by those in Northern Ireland, East Anglia, the north and north-west England. Manufacturing output in Yorkshire and Humberside is expected to rise more slowly than in other areas, while production in the south-east may be constrained by high stocks of finished goods. Scottish manufacturers are less optimistic than others about orders in the coming months. Mr Holt said the revival in industry's fortunes partly reflected improved export prospects following the devaluation of sterling since September. But he said that the recovery was not confined to exporters. While the upturn in the west Midlands and Wales was largely export led, industry had also recovered in the south-east and East Anglia, which were less export dependent. Business Strategies estimates that manufacturing employment will fall by 30,000 to 4.28m in the current quarter compared with the first three months of this year and will be 194,000 lower than in the second quarter of last year. While the current quarter is expected to see a halt to job losses in the west Midlands, northern England and Northern Ireland, employment levels in these regions will still be substantially below last year's levels. Scotland's recovery was likely to be slower than the rest of the UK because it was later into the recession and investment had slowed in the offshore oil sector. Mr Holt said the government's pit closure plans could be contributing to the relatively muted production prospects in Yorkshire and Humberside. Companies in Yorkshire and Humberside, as well as in East Anglia, the south-west, Wales and the west Midlands still plan to increase investment. But many manufacturers in Wales and Yorkshire and Humberside, as well as in Northern Ireland, the south-east and north-west England, complained that a shortage of company-generated finance could limit expansion. The survey of nearly 1,300 companies between March 26 and April 14 found increased concern among manufacturers in East Anglia, the west Midlands and the north-west that political and economic conditions abroad might limit their ability to win export orders.

An Army helicopter spotted the body of Private Reginald  McCollum, 19, from Cookstown, Co Tyrone, on land between two  housing estates on the outskirts of Armagh. Security forces were  not immediately able to recover the body for fear that it had  been booby-trapped. Pte McCollum, a single man, had been in the  RIR for 16 months and was based in Armagh. He was last seen at a  chip shop in the city at 2.30am after attending a stag night.    It was the third time his family have mourned a member  killed  at the hands of the IRA.    A year ago his brother Nigel, 25, was killed by an IRA  mortar  bomb fired at a police station in Keady, Co Armagh. He was a  civilian contractor operating a crane for renovation work on the  station when it was attacked.    Ten years ago Pte McCollum's grandmother was killed by a  booby-trap bomb meant for someone else.    Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland Secretary, challenged  the Sinn Fein president, Gerry Adams, to condemn the killing as  well as the recent murder by the IRA of Fred Anthony, a police  cleaner, and the injuring of his three-year-old daughter, Emma.    He said: ""The IRA is killing again, this time after  interrogating their victim. Is Mr Adams, who calls for peace,  now going to condemn these crimes?""    ""The IRA besmirch all they touch including the cause of  Irish  nationalism, just as the UVF, the UFF, and their like, besmirch  the cause of Unionism.""    The murder is the first by the IRA since the Government's  response on Thursday to Sinn Fein's demands for clarification of  the Downing Street Declaration.    The killing would suggest that some activists are intent on  ignoring calls by Dublin and the mainly nationalist SDLP for the  terrorists to suspend their violence while the Government's  reply is considered.

However, in a move that augured badly for the future pariticipation of the hardline Democratic Unionist party in talks, the Rev Ian Paisley, the party's leader, unexpectedly delivered a letter protesting against the holding of yesterday's Anglo-Irish intergovernmental conference session in Belfast. It emerged earlier this week that the UK government was prepared to press ahead with the peace process even without DUP participation. Yesterday's conference followed on from the start of the new peace initiative of Mr John Major, the British prime minister, and Mr Albert Reynolds, his Irish counterpart, in Brussels last week. After the meeting Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, and Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, expressed optimism that the two governments would press ahead quickly towards a new constitutional settlement. They made clear that dialogue would initially take the form of bilateral discussions with British ministers. Sir Patrick warned that an immediate push for resumption of round-table discussions with all parties could be counter-productive. 'The only point in getting around the table is when there is an agreement achievable,' he said. One possible target would be to have an agreement in place before Mr Major and Mr Reynolds meet at the UK-Ireland summit in Dublin within six weeks. Sir Patrick said the six-point plan put forward by Mr Spring last week would be 'central to the ideas that the two governments must bring to a conclusion between themselves'. The plan showed 'very encouraging evidence of the thinking of the Irish government'. Sir Patrick also spoke of the 'unbreakable meshing' between the UK-Irish talks and what the province's political parties were 'prepared to compromise over' regarding the internal government of Northern Ireland. Sir Patrick said there was 'no question at the moment' of having reached the stage where Ireland's constitutional claim to jurisdiction over Northern Ireland would be replaced or where the Anglo-Irish agreement was 'going to be repealed'.

Senior MPs are encouraging ministers to abandon the old 'nothing is agreed until everything is agreed' formula governing political talks on Northern Ireland's future, in favour of an undertaking that nothing is implemented until everything is agreed. They suggest such a change could enable cross-party backing for a blueprint for devolved government to be secured more quickly without departing from the so-called three-stranded approach supported by nationalists. This requires relations between Ulster and Dublin and London and Dublin to be dealt with in the same process as the province's internal politics for the purposes of the current talks. News of the MPs' initiative emerged amid indications that unionists and Tory rightwingers have been heartened by remarks made by Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, this week. Sir Patrick told The Daily Telegraph newspaper that Dublin's territorial claim to Ulster was the central issue to be resolved in drafting a joint framework document aimed at encouraging the province's political parties to return to the negotiating table. Meanwhile leaders of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, prepared for this weekend's conference - at which the party's response to the Downing Street declaration is expected to be decided - as the cycle of violence in the province continued with a killing and a spate of firebomb attacks. Mr Bobby Monaghan, 44, a Catholic barman, was shot by loyalist gunmen from the outlawed Ulster Freedom Fighters in Newtonabbey, north of Belfast. In London, two High Court judges indicated that they intend to refer the government ban on Mr Gerry Adams visiting mainland Britain to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg.

Mr Molyneaux, who was speaking in Washington, added to a series of recent upbeat predictions about an end to terrorism made by politicians and security forces in the province since the IRA's recent three-day ceasefire. In a particularly optimistic forecast, which caused some surprise in Ulster last night, Mr Molyneaux said he believed violence would soon begin to decline. He stressed he was not ruling out 'the occasional Mafia-type operation' but said that, once terrorist violence was over, the 'one united community in Northern Ireland - Protestant, Catholic, no religion at all - will sit very firmly on anyone who seeks to disturb the settlements which are now beginning'. Meanwhile, British and Irish police yesterday carried out a series of raids as part of an unprecedented co-ordinated security crackdown on funding for the IRA. Scotland Yard said that a substantial quantity of drugs, cash, stolen property and financial instruments was recovered from 41 addresses in the Irish Republic, Northern Ireland, north-west England, London and the county of Surrey. There were eight arrests. The raids involved 1,000 officers drawn from police on both sides of the Irish border, including the Royal Ulster Constabulary's anti-racketeering squad, the Metropolitan Police anti-terrorist squad and three UK regional squads. The raids were part of a joint operation codenamed Operation Madronna. This has involved more than a year of covert investigation, also involving the British security service MI5, into suspect sourcing of several millions of pounds of funding for the operations of the IRA. A joint police statement last night described the raids as the first time the RUC's anti-racketeering squad had mounted an operation involving so many forces.

Details of the initiative are still private, but Mr Albert Reynolds, the Taoiseach (Irish prime minister), and Mr Dick Spring, the foreign minister, are expected to discuss them with Mr Hume tomorrow in Dublin, when he arrives after a nine-day visit to the United States where he met Congressional leaders and advisers to President Bill Clinton. Last night Mr Spring said: 'Any statement that gives the appearance of wanting to establish peace in Ireland is something that has to be dealt with.' 'But if they are serious about wanting to establish peace . . . I would say to them 'Stop the killings, stop the bombings', and let people know that they are serious.' An Irish government spokesman said yesterday: 'The Taoiseach is keeping an open mind. He is looking forward to hearing what progress has been made (in the Hume-Adams talks) and if they can advance the progress to peace, then there will be a positive reaction to the initiative.' The Dublin government has maintained that it has not yet received any details of the Hume-Adams initiative, although a senior foreign ministry official is reported to have met Mr Hume a few days before the Hume-Adams announcement. The foreign ministry would neither confirm nor deny these reports. 'Our officials have many contacts in Northern Ireland and it is not our policy to make comments on individual meetings,' it said. The UK government is also believed to have been informed of the initiative, when Mr Hume met Mr John Major on September 16. As a result, the hard-line Democratic Unionist party headed by Rev Ian Paisley has angrily ruled out any further participation in the round-table talks process. DUP leaders walked out of an acrimonious meeting in Belfast last Friday with Mr Michael Ancram, minister of state for Northern Ireland, claiming that the government had refused to discuss fresh DUP proposals for a new constitutional assembly in Northern Ireland, which were first presented to Mr Major more than two weeks ago. A Northern Ireland Office spokesman said last Friday's meeting: 'was not a fruitful meeting'. He said that the DUP proposals had been on the agenda, 'but Dr Paisley instead launched an attack on what he claimed was a government dialogue with Sinn Fein'. He said the NIO had not yet decided whether to attempt to reconvene the round-table talks, which have been stalled since last November, without the participation of the DUP, 'but it has not been ruled out either'. It has also emerged that Mr Spring and Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, met in New York last week when the latest developments on Northern Ireland were discussed. Mr Spring had been in New York to address the General Assembly of the United Nations last Friday. In his speech he said: 'The pieces of the jigsaw are all to hand if only we can find the right way to fit them together . . we will bring to any resumed talks the resources of goodwill, flexibility and imagination which we believe all participants must display if a new agree-ment is to be achieved. 'It is painfully obvious that all traditional approaches have failed and that new thinking is urgently required . . . we are ready to accept the need for radical and innovative compromise as part of a new accommodation which will bring lasting peace and reconciliation to the island of Ireland. 'Peace is now the imperative; and the continuation of violence is the single greatest obstacle to the realisation of our hopes. An end to violence would, at least, help to clear the way for compromise and negotiation'. As if to underline that statement, the IRA yesterday exploded bombs in both Belfast and London. Two bombs exploded in Belfast, one at a tyre depot in the docks area, and one at an electrical wholesalers in the north of the city. No one was injured in either blast but both bombs caused extensive damage. Five bombs were set off in north London yesterday morning, causing havoc with rush-hour traffic but apparently causing no injuries and only minor damage. Commander David Tucker, head of the Anti-Terrorist Squad, said that the lack of a usual telephoned warning was a 'sinister change of strategy' by the IRA. The IRA has confirmed that it planted three bombs in north London on Saturday which injured five passers-by.   Countries:-  GBZ   United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P9721 International Affairs.

0,FT941-2421 ,"FT941-2421 _AN-ECUC0AC4FT 940321   FT  21 MAR 94 / Dublin willing to back a temporary IRA ceasefire      By TIM COONE      DUBLIN   The Irish government sought to breathe fresh life into the Northern Ireland peace process yesterday by indicating that a temporary ceasefire by the IRA would be welcomed in Dublin. Speaking on Irish radio, Mr Dick Spring, the foreign minister, said a temporary ceasefire would be 'a step in the right direction'. The Irish government's decision to encourage a temporary ceasefire contrasts with the previous approach in both London and Dublin of concentrating on the prospects for a permanent cessation of violence. Mr Spring said the Irish government would 'encourage' the IRA to move to a permanent end to violence, and 'would want to build upon' a temporary ceasefire. His comments followed weekend reports of an interview given to New Century, a leftwing British magazine, in which he appeared to suggest that a temporary ceasefire could help to break the deadlock in the peace process. In remarks intended to reassure unionist opinion, Mr Spring said Dublin's view on the timing of talks with the republican movement remained 'very firm'. 'I have to repeat that we will not negotiate with the IRA/Sinn Fein as long as they support violence. If they want to enter the political process, there has to be a permanent cessation of violence and a very firm declaration to that effect,' he said. That formula fits in with the consistent approach by the British government since the publication of the British-Irish Downing Street declaration on Northern Ireland in December. But Dublin's increased willingness to welcome a temporary ceasefire appeared to take the British government by surprise. The Northern Ireland Office was unwilling to endorse Mr Spring's views. Officials would say only that Sinn Fein could enter exploratory talks with the British government within three months of a permanent cessation of violence. In the New Century interview, parts of which were published yesterday in The Observer, Mr Spring appeared to indicate that a temporary ceasefire could be built upon 'without making concessions' to the IRA or Sinn Fein, its political wing. In the interview, given two weeks ago, Mr Spring said the republican movement's strategy appeared to be to offer a temporary cessation of violence 'in order to sit down round the table with other nationalist parties'. He said this would 'pose a bit of a dilemma'. The apparent contradiction in Dublin's position would seem to lie in a semantic distinction being drawn by Dublin between 'talks' and 'negotiations'. An Irish government spokesman was unable to confirm or deny that talks, either directly or indirectly with Sinn Fein - as distinct from negotiations  -could take place after a temporary IRA ceasefire. The IRA admitted yesterday carrying out the attack on Crossmaglen police and army post, which seriously injured a policeman and brought down an army helicopter on Saturday night.

But ahead of their planned talks at Chequers, there were signs of Irish irritation at a move by Mr Major to separate plans for an Ulster assembly from wider talks on the province's status. The meeting will follow British denial of a claim by Mr Martin McGuinness, a leading official of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, about private assurances by the British government. Mr McGuinness said on BBC television that during secret contacts last year, a British civil servant had said London was working towards a united Ireland. Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, said the claim was 'nonsense'. Mr Major hopes to persuade Mr Reynolds that the territorial claim to Ulster in Articles 2 and 3 of the Irish constitution is the main obstacle to an agreed approach. Dublin has agreed to modify the claim, but the British side will argue that unless Mr Reynolds goes further, moderate unionists in Northern Ireland will reject a proposed framework document for talks on the province's future. The Irish prime minister, meanwhile, is concerned that Mr Major appears to have weakened Britain's commitment to the comprehensive 'three-stranded' approach to negotiations. Mr Major said last week that proposals for strand one - the creation of an assembly - were separate from the Anglo-Irish framework document, which would cover strands two and three. Those concern relations between north and south and between London and Dublin. Mr Reynolds spelt out his demands yesterday that the proposed cross-border institutions in strand two of the process must be given 'executive functions'. He said: 'Such institutions also must address some of the key interests common to north and south on a pragmatic basis.' Irish officials said Mr Reynolds wanted today's meeting to 'pick up the pace'. He was anxious to harness Sinn Fein to the political process quickly to bolster Republican moderates. Dublin will also press for flexibility on the issue of the surrender of IRA arms. Mr Reynolds repeated his view that the question 'had to be confronted and dealt with but is not a precondition for talks'. In a move underlying Irish concerns, police in the republic detained several people over the weekend in a four-county operation against 'elements of Sinn Fein-IRA who may try to destabilise the peace process'. One Irish newspaper yesterday said the IRA would review its ceasefire decision in the spring. Mr McGuinness warned: 'If the central issues at the heart of this conflict are not addressed or resolved, there will continue to be conflict.'   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

0,FT923-15074 ,"FT923-15074 _AN-CGCA3AFVFT 920703   FT  03 JUL 92 / Talks may answer Ulster question      By RALPH ATKINS   Face-to-face talks between leaders of political parties in Northern Ireland and the British and Irish governments are expected to start in London next week. The latest series of political talks started in April but are based on a programme agreed by the partici-pants in March last year. The structure of the talks is highly complex, reflecting the sensitivities of the province's politics. Ralph Atkins answers fundamental questions about progress so far. What exactly has been agreed this week? So far the talks process has been on 'strand one' in which local politicians discussed devolution in Northern Ireland with the UK government. Now agreement has been reached to move to 'strand two' when the Dublin government will enter and discussions will turn to relations between north and south Ireland. How significant is it? Perhaps the most momentous development is the broadening of discussion on Northern Ireland's future. No unionist has negotiated with the Irish Republic since the 1973 Sunningdale conference. This time the talks with Dublin will include the Rev Ian Paisley, hardline leader of the Democratic Unionist Party, making it the first negotiations in which all shades of unionist opinion have been represented since partition in the early 1920s. However, it is still only an agreement to talk, and there is less than a month before talks are supposed to end. If Unionists had fears about starting 'strand two' they may have been encouraged by knowing that time will almost certainly run out. With Northern Ireland's 'troubles' descending from centuries of conflict, few expect a lasting settlement to emerge in days. Why are there three 'strands'? To reconcile unionists' and nationalists' mutual distrust. The Ulster Unionist party and the DUP believe the government of Northern Ireland is of no concern to a 'foreign' government such as that in the Irish Republic. But they recognise a need for good relations with neighbours. The nationalist Social Democratic and Labour Party argues Northern addressing the 'totality of relationships' within the British Isles. Last year Mr Peter Brooke, then Northern Ireland secretary, agreed with unionists, nationalists and the Irish government that discussions in the three 'strands' would be phased. Nothing would be formally agreed until everything was agreed but 'strand two' would start 'within weeks'. Mr Brooke failed to get beyond 'strand one' but paved the way for talks to restart in April this year before being replaced by Sir Patrick Mayhew. This time, amid continuing unionist suspicion, it took informal meetings in strand two and three 'formation' over the past two weeks before a formal start to strand two could be agreed. Strand three, between the UK and Irish governments and on relations between the two countries, is also about to start. This is regarded as particularly significant by unionists because the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement - which they oppose because of the role it gives Dublin - and the republic's constitutional claim on the province are now on the negotiating table. Is the talks process likely to make much more progress? Sir Patrick admited on Tuesway further to go'. But developments so far have already surprised some commentators who argued that unionist and nationalists could never work together. Talks could be re-started later this year. Are the unionists and nationalists moving towards each other? Hardly. The process is more about finding political structures to reconcile their conflicting aspirations. Mr Paisley and Mr James Molyneaux, unionist leaders, would not be able to sell to their supporters any deal which gave nationalist undue influence. Mr John Hume, SDLP leader, will not allow a return to the old unionist hegemony of Ulster. How much agreement on issues been reached so far? It is hard to tell. An agreement not to disclose the content of discussions is holding apart from some selective briefing. There looks to be some agreement between the two unionist parties and the non-sectarian Alliance party on a devolved structure with a controlling 'panel'. But the SDLP's proposals for six commissioners including three appointed by London, Dublin and the European Community is unacceptable to unionists. How big are the differences between the UK and Irish governments? Unlike the worst years of the 1980s there is little 'megaphone diplomacy' but there are still considerable tensions that should not be underestimated. Mr David Andrews, Irish foreign minister, has raised the stakes by saying that, if his country's constitution is to be discussed, so too should the 1920s UK legislation which led to partition. Sir Patrick has played a 'neutral facilitator' role and has never made speeches on his vision of Northern Ireland. But he is seen as a friend of the Union. Why has the talks process been time-limited? Unionists refused to talk while the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement was in operation - including the regular inter-government conferences. The Irish government refused to abandon it but agreed to a suspension of its workings. After a conference meeting in April a 'gap' was agreed until the end of this month. The Irish government has indicated, however, that it will be flexible  -possibly allowing an extension if talks are making progress. Why has Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, been excluded? The UK and Irish governments refuse to talk to Sinn Fein until it renounces the use of violence. Unionist leaders would walk out if allies of the IRA joined negotiations. Will the terrorist killings stop? No - at least not in the foreseeable future. The IRA wants British troops and politicians out of Northern Ireland. But if a lasting political settlement is found the terrorists' strongest argument - that politics has failed in Northern Ireland - will have been undermined. As long as the IRA exists, loyalist terrorists will arm themselves.  The Financial Times   London Page 10  "

His comments came as Mr John Hume, leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party, started the first of a series of visits to the US by senior Ulster politicians. Mr Hume, who is likely to meet Mr Al Gore, US vice-president, tomorrow, will be followed by a group of senior Ulster Unionist politicians and almost certainly by Mr Adams. US, Irish and UK officials are understood to have been working behind the scenes to ensure that the visits by Mr Hume and the UUP representatives precede and have a higher profile at official level than that of Mr Adams. The Sinn Fein leader is expected to start his US visit on the west coast next weekend. Meanwhile in Saudi Arabia Mr Major said the IRA was 'very close' to providing acceptable assurances that its open-ended ceasefire was permanent. The prime minister's remarks came three days after he challenged republican leaders to use last week's lifting of the government's broadcasting ban on Sinn Fein to provide the assurances he was looking for. But Sir Patrick Mayhew, speaking in Londonderry, appeared to adopt a sterner note when asked if he was satisfied that IRA violence was over for good. The Northern Ireland secretary said: 'No. I do not think that we have been given that assertion. I can only go upon the words and the deeds of those who have used violence here in Northern Ireland for the last 25 years and killed something like 3,000 people.' Anti-terrorist security at Belfast's largest stores was scaled down yesterday. Staff will no longer frisk customers and search handbags for incendiary bombs.

The shooting, the first since the IRA and loyalist paramilitaries declared ceasefires, cast a shadow over the Northern Ireland peace process. It will almost certainly increase pressure on London and Dublin to step up their efforts to secure the surrender of paramilitary weapons. Reaction to the murder was generally restrained, though Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, accused the Royal Ulster Constabulary of trying to damage the peace process by blaming republicans for the shooting. The IRA said its position on the two-month-old ceasefire remained unchanged. Dublin's decision to cancel the release orders for the IRA prisoners was announced by Mrs Maire Geoghegan-Quinn, the Irish justice minister, after a meeting with Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister. It came less than 24 hours after her department gave details of the men to be freed as part of the Irish government's response to the IRA's ceasefire. An embarrassed Dublin government said it had stopped their releases because initial reports from the RUC suggested 'the possible participation' of Provisional IRA members. Mrs Geoghegan-Quinn said the planned releases had been 'based specifically on the premise that the Provisional IRA campaign of violence was over for good'. However after a cabinet meeting, government sources insisted the peace process would not be derailed by the killing. Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, said he was 'deeply angered' by the 'callous and wicked' murder. It demonstrated, he added, 'the wanton dangers of illegally held arms'. The attack took place in Newry, Co Down. Three armed men, dressed as postmen and using a post office van, entered a fenced sorting centre. An employee, Mr Frank Kerr, 53, was shot dead after a struggle. Two of the armed men were later arrested after a chase involving helicopters near the Irish border. The third escaped and was last night being sought by police. Sinn Fein insisted last night that the raid was not the work of the IRA and did not represent a breach of the ceasefire. Republican sources in South Armagh, a strongly nationalist area, said the raid was the work of renegade, freelance republicans committing a straightforward criminal act to make some money. A statement from the IRA implied as much, asserting simply: 'On August 31 the IRA announced a complete cessation of military operations. All our units were instructed accordingly. This position has not changed.' Mr Adams was said to be 'visibly shaken' when told of the raid by a reporter. Yesterday's killing came on the eve of a meeting between British and Irish officials to discuss the framework document which the two governments hope will form the basis of a durable political settlement in the province. Sir Patrick and Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, are to discuss the document in the Republic of Ireland on Monday. British and Irish politicians said the shooting showed the need for a rapid surrender of weapons. Mr Seamus Mallon, Social Democratic and Labour party MP for Newry, said: 'It was an IRA operation whether it was sanctioned or not by those they call their leaders.' His view was echoed by Mr David Trimble, Ulster Unionist party spokesman on legal affairs. He said: 'Freelance operations don't take place in that area unless they're licensed by the IRA.'

In a move likely to underline the delicacy of the task which the government faces in forging a deal between Ulster's constitutional parties, Mr Paisley will present the prime minister with a document setting out his party's proposed solution to the conflict. He will argue strongly that London should not offer Dublin anything in return for removing its constitutional claim to Ulster. News of Mr Paisley's plans emerged as Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, insisted that the Irish peace process would continue, in spite his party's refusal on Sunday to recommend an IRA ceasefire. Mr Adams said: 'The peace process is not dead, it is very much alive. I remain optimistic that we can move on. We need a process of demilitarisation and I am optimistic we can move towards that.' In London, Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, said the IRA's political wing was isolated as never before. He added: 'Sinn Fein and the IRA, for whom they speak, are now seen to be continuing to use torture, murder, terror and indiscriminate violence for political purposes in circumstances where both governments say that the future of Ireland lies in democracy.' In Dublin, the Irish government took pains to play down the appearances of a split between Mr Albert Reynolds, the prime minister, and Mr Dick Spring, the foreign affairs minister, over how it should react to Sinn Fein's response. In his initial reaction on Sunday night Mr Reynolds said he saw positive signals in Sinn Fein's response. Mr Spring was much less positive. He said many people would be disappointed. As Mr Mitchel McLaughlin, a senior Sinn Fein official, called in London for the immediate reinstatement of dialogue between the British government and the IRA's political wing, Irish government officials said channels of communication between Dublin and Sinn Fein would remain open. Today's six-page Democratic Unionist document is understood to draw on many points from an earlier submission by the party, 'Breaking the Logjam'. This called for the election of an assembly that would be given the task of agreeing a form of government for Ulster in the UK. Only once agreement had been reached and approved by voters in Ulster, and Dublin had removed its territorial claim, would the assembly start negotiations on north-south relations. Mr Paisley is expected to resist any pressure from Downing Street to return to the political talks process under Mr Michael Ancram, Northern Ireland minister.

0,FT934-10400 ,"FT934-10400 _AN-DKEC2ADWFT 931105   FT  05 NOV 93 / Molyneaux optimistic on talks: Ulster Unionist party leader says N Ireland assembly is possible      By DAVID OWEN   MR JAMES MOLYNEAUX last night gave a substantial boost to the Anglo-Irish initiative for peace in Northern Ireland by delivering a surprisingly upbeat assessment of its prospects for success. In his first public comments since Mr John Major, the prime minister, and Mr Albert Reynolds, his Irish counterpart, launched the initiative in Brussels last week, the leader of the biggest political party in the province, the Ulster Unionist party, suggested a Northern Ireland assembly could be set up 'in the fairly short term'. He also responded positively to the six-point plan set out recently by Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, saying it was a 'hopeful sign'. His remarks came as Mr John Hume, leader of the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party, sought to revive his joint peace initiative with Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, by claiming the offer of a 'total cessation of violence' was on the table as a result of their dialogue. Mr Hume said there would be 'peace within a week' if his initiative was embraced. 'My conclusion is that that is now a real possibility - a total cessation of violence, not a ceasefire.' But after an hour-long meeting between Mr Hume and Mr Major, Downing Street issued a fresh rebuff to the SDLP leader, insisting it was last week's statement by Mr Major and Mr Reynolds that had set out the basis for 'peace, stability and reconciliation' in the province. Further cold water was poured over the Hume-Adams plan by Mr Molyneaux, who said it was 'six bridges too far'. In a move likely to inflame Unionists further, Mr Hume said he intended to brief Mr Adams on his meeting at Downing Street. The session was also attended by Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary. Mr Hume indicated later it would no longer be possible for Sir Patrick to say he did not know details of the Hume-Adams initiative. Mr Major is seeing leaders of the province's four constitutional political parties over the next few days. Yesterday's meeting with Mr Hume was followed by a similar session with Mr John Alderdice of the Alliance party. Last night's Downing Street statement emphasised that the government was 'ready' to table proposals to give 'focus and direction' to talks involving the four parties once they agreed to resume negotiations. It emerged yesterday that the Irish government believes it will become clear by early December if there is to be a breakthrough on the Major-Reynolds peace initiative. Mr Reynolds told the Irish parliament he intended to meet Mr Major again on December 3, before the next meeting of the European Council. Dublin also acted to clear up ambiguity over Mr Spring's six points, one of which was that Unionist consent would be required for any constitutional change in the north. Mr Reynolds made it clear this was not meant as an additional concession. In Commons exchanges with Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, Mr Major said he intended to take 'a very direct interest' in peace efforts, while hinting that an early return to round-table talks was unlikely. 'I don't want to see an artificially staged event where the talks are called together with no probability of them making progress,' he said.

0,FT923-1802 ,"FT923-1802 _AN-CIUDDAEDFT 920921   FT  21 SEP 92 / Survey of Northern Ireland (6): Ex-soldier uses political instinct - Profile of Michael Mates      By TIM COONE   WHEN Mr Michael Mates was appointed to hold the security portfolio at the Northern Ireland Office in April, hopes and apprehensions were stirred in equal measure on the two sides of the religious divide in Ulster. A former lieutenant-colonel in the Queen's Dragoon Guards, Mr Mates is no newcomer to the province, having served there with his battalion in the early 1970s when the 'troubles' were at their peak. His 20-year military career saw him serve in Germany and Cyprus as well as Ulster and finally brought him on to the team of the Vice-Chief of Defence Staff at the Ministry of Defence, before he entered politics as a Conservative MP in 1974. For the Ulster Unionists, Mr Mates' appointment to oversee security in the province was a signal that their appeals for a tougher stand against the IRA had been heard. An ex-soldier/politician would be more amenable, so they thought, to their insistence that selective internment and covert operations must become the new weapons with which to break the back of the IRA. The SDLP and the nationalist community were meanwhile apprehensive that such a 'get-tough' policy would sweep away much of what had been achieved in recent years through painstaking work in trying to reduce tensions in the Catholic community and simply fuel a new recruitment drive for the IRA. On appearances alone, Mr Mates' burly frame and defiant paratrooper's jaw would suggest that the Unionists might have cause to celebrate. His political instinct, however, has been honed by almost two decades in parliament. Since winning Petersfield for the Tories in 1974, Mr Mates has become a familiar sight in Westminster corridors and committee rooms. He has been secretary of the Conservative parliamentary Northern Ireland Committee from 1974-79, its vice-chairman from 1979-81 and is currently the chairman of the all-party Anglo-Irish parliamentary group. He has also been secretary of the influential 1922 backbench committee in the Conservative party, and chairman of the Conservative Home Affairs Committee. He has sat on the Commons Select Committee on Defence since its formation in 1979 and been its chairman since 1987. In the latter role, he has been critical of the government's plans to cut the British Army strength from 156,000 to 116,000 by the mid-1990s and from his new vantage point in Ulster, he can be expected to argue even more forcibly against the cuts. An ally of Mr Michael Heseltine, Mr Mates was passed over numerous times for ministerial appointment during the Thatcher years. So after nearly two decades on the backbenches, he now has the first opportunity to prove his ministerial mettle. 'This is the biggest challenge of my career,' he said. 'I am here to do things and I feel I can get on and do them. There is an urgency and vibrancy here where events often require immediate action and decisions.' There will be no headlong rush for a military solution to the province's problems, however. 'There is no question of a military victory against the IRA. The only way to defeat them is by a combination of economic, social and political development and in the meantime we have to redouble our efforts to contain the violence,' he said. Significantly, Mr Mates also holds the finance portfolio at the Northern Ireland Office, making him responsible for the allocation of its entire Pounds 7bn budget. Does not that put him in the role of both gamekeeper and poacher? 'We have to ensure that health, education and housing and the like have their share but we can't compromise on security.' Some business leaders and politicians believe the government is indeed compromising on security - a view reinforced in some minds by Mr Mates' recent statement that it is 'impossible' to stop the bomb attacks in Belfast city centre. He is unrepentant. 'The IRA wants to make life intolerable. I want to make it tolerable. We could easily put a cordon around Belfast, but in doing that the IRA would have achieved its objective.' Mr Mates thus sees his job as one of ensuring the security forces are adequately resourced to contain and weaken the paramilitaries while the province's politicians thrash out a solution. As chairman of the Commons Select Committee on Defence, he is acutely aware of the budget restraints facing the armed forces and the restraints that this places upon Northern Ireland's security policy. 'I do not want to see British soldiers in the streets and countryside of Northern Ireland any longer than they need to be. The day I can send a battalion home I shall be very happy, and when I can send two battalions home I shall be even happier.'  The Financial Times   London Page 14  "

Mr Molyneaux, speaking in Washington, added to a series of upbeat predictions about an end to terrorism made by politicians and security forces in the province since the IRA's three-day ceasefire two weeks ago. In a particularly optimistic forecast which caused some surprise in Ulster last night, Mr Molyneaux said he believed violence would begin to decline. He said: 'If you ask me where we will be this time next year, I stick my neck out and say . . . we are going to see the ice breaking up even more, we are going to see an end to violence as far as the main forces are concerned.' Mr Molyneaux did not rule out 'the occasional Mafia-type operation' but said that once terrorism was over the 'united community in Northern Ireland - Protestant, Catholic, no religion at all - will sit very firmly on anyone who seeks to disturb the settlements which are now beginning'. Sir Hugh Annesley, Ulster's chief constable, has in recent weeks privately suggested that violence could end within three years.

0,FT944-2509 ,"FT944-2509 _AN-ELSBNAAPFT 941216   FT  16 DEC 94 / Calm hand at helm of uneasy coalition: The challenges facing John Bruton as Ireland's new premier      by JOHN MURRAY BROWN   Mr John Bruton was once described as 'John Unionist' by Mr Albert Reynolds, the man he succeeded yesterday as Ireland's new prime minister. It was an unfortunate slip of the tongue. Nonetheless, the inadvertent allusion to Mr Bruton's views on Northern Ireland highlights one of the key differences in government policy likely to emerge with his accession yesterday as head of a three-party coalition between his Fine Gael party, Labour and the small Democratic Left. The feeling in Dublin last night was one of relief after a month of deliberations and allegations, which had left Ireland in the hands of a caretaker administration since the collapse of the Fianna Fail-Labour coalition after a judicial appointment row. The delay had cast an ill-timed shadow over the Northern Ireland peace process, straining relations between Dublin and Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, and halting negotiations on the joint framework document which Ireland and the UK hope will form the basis for all-party talks on Ulster's constitutional future. Ireland still faces a hectic diplomatic agenda, with Dublin due to host the European Union's 1996 intergovernmental conference. Some analysts yesterday predicted the coalition might not survive that long. The potential for discord within such a wide-ranging coalition is clear. Fianna Fail, licking its wounds on the opposition benches, is in no mood to be forgiving. Mr Bruton's Fine Gael is a rural-based conservative party with largely middle class support which has lost votes to Mr Dick Spring's more urban Labour party. Meanwhile, Mr Proinsias De Rossa's Democratic Left is an old-fashioned socialist party and the successor of the Official IRA, when the Provisional IRA broke away to pursue the armed struggle in 1970. Even at the last minute yesterday, Democratic Left looked set to pull out of negotiations once it became clear the party, which has just six seats in the Dail, was being offered a single cabinet portfolio. Last night the single overriding preoccupation of all the parties seemed to be a determination to see Fianna Fail consigned to the opposition. In Mr Bruton, the government will have calm if uncharismatic leadership. A former finance minister, he is a plain speaking barrister with 20 years in the Dail and a wealth of ministerial experience. Politically he is said to be close to the rural wing of the party, identified with Mr Liam Cosgrave, a former prime minister. In February Mr Bruton rode out a leadership challenge, and still could be vulnerable to attack from the liberal wing of the party associated with another former premier, Dr Garret Fitzgerald. Mr Bruton likes to dub Fine Gael as 'part of the great European Christian Democrat movement'. He campaigned in favour of divorce reform, where there will be a meeting of minds with Labour and Democratic Left. On the North, the strains may be difficult to hide. Fine Gael is historically identified as the party which voted for the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921, which created partition. As a believer in a more accommodating stance towards the Unionists, Mr Bruton is likely to push for reform of Articles 2 and 3 of the constitution, which enshrine Ireland's territorial claim to Northern Ireland. London in particular is keen to see that Fianna Fail, which has played a key role in the peace process so far, should not now be isolated. The party, as the voice of constitutional republicanism (Fianna Fail voted against the Treaty) enjoys better relations with Sinn Fein than the other parties. As a result, Fianna Fail's support could be critical if the coalition is to steer through constitutional reform, which would have to be put to a referendum. On the economy, the coalition's problems are perhaps more acute. Mr Bruton is sometimes described as Thatcherite on economic policy and he certainly won a reputation for tight spending policies when in charge of finance in 1982 after the profligate years of Mr Charles Haughey's Fianna Fail government. Any attempt by Fine Gael to cut taxes and reduce public spending is likely to be resisted by Labour and Democratic Left.   Countries:-  IEZ  Ireland, EC.

The Northern Ireland Industrial Development Board is seeking information from Taiwanese officials about the repercussions for the Hualon Corporation of the indictment on Wednesday of Mr Oung Ta-ming, the effective head of the Hualon group, and 33 businessmen linked to him on share manipulation and other fraud charges. A British official said yesterday: 'The Hualon project is clearly fraught with problems, no doubt about that. We said we were dealing with a respectable and successful company. Now we have this.' The development board confirmed it was delaying giving approval to the start-up of construction of the plant until the outcome of legal action in the European Court in which European textile and clothing manufacturers are challenging a Pounds 61m government grant to Hualon. The case is expected to take about 18 months. Construction was originally due to begin by autumn this year. The development board said it was 'monitoring developments in Taiwan closely' and 'seeking clarification' to establish what involvement, if any, those indicted had with the Hualon project in Northern Ireland. It added that the indictment of Mr Oung was expected to be among factors 'taken on board' by the European Court. Mrs Jennifer d'Abo, a former development board director who resigned last month in protest at the project, said last night that it should now be scrapped. Mrs d'Abo said that before she resigned she had written to senior officials of the development board asking for information about pending criminal proceedings against Hualon executives, but had never received a satisfactory answer. The Hualon Teijran Corp, which announced the Northern Ireland investment earlier this year, was not named in indictment documents. Mr Oung is thought to control the company, however, and was present in June at a ceremony marking the announcement.   Companies:-  Hualon Corp.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

But Mr Reynolds' comment that written questions about the declaration from Sinn Fein were 'answerable' coincided with the murder by the IRA of another British soldier in a rocket attack on an army outpost in Armagh. Speaking in the US where he held unscheduled talks at the weekend with Mr Bill Clinton, the US president, Mr Reynolds, also indicated that Dublin and London would not wait indefinitely for a positive response from the Republican movement. Mr Reynolds, pictured above right with Mr Clinton during a ceremony in Indianapolis honouring Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr, told RTE radio: 'The questions by and large are answerable, and I hope that the British government will see them in that light, and will give the most positive response they can.' He added: 'I think the vast majority of people in Ireland - and Britain - want to see a breakthrough, and move this latest roadblock out of the way.' But in a speech in Chicago where he received an honorary degree from the University of Notre Dame, Mr Reynolds displayed his frustration at the IRA's refusal to end its campaign. Stressing the two governments' commitment to secure a new broad-ranging political accord to replace the Anglo-Irish agreement of 1985, Mr Reynolds said: 'The leaders of the Republican movement know that we still hope they will opt to play their part . . . They must also know, as Edmund Burke once put it, that there is a limit at which forbearance ceases to be a virtue.' Mr Michael Ancram, Northern Ireland minister, signalled that the two governments were drafting plans for a comprehensive political settlement. British ministers said the questions submitted by Sinn Fein, passed to the London government by Dublin last week, would be published within the next few days. Alongside them would be the government's responses. But Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, was determined that Britain would not be drawn into negotiations on the declaration unless and until the IRA ended permanently its campaign of violence. Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, gave a clear hint during a weekend meeting of the areas in which the IRA was seeking clarification. These include the timescale in which Britain expected to see agreement between all the people of Ireland, the constitutional options it foresaw as realistic alternatives to the status quo and the basis for the 'Unionist veto' on change in the north.

He is to meet Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, in Dublin today. However an early resumption of talks is unlikely. Britain and Ireland are expected to first hold two Anglo-Irish conference meetings, under the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement, before a suspension for the talks' duration. Local politicians may also want to wait until after May's local elections in the province. Differences of emphasis between unionist and nationalist leaders emerged at Commons questions yesterday. Mr Seamus Mallon, deputy leader of the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour Party, hinted he wanted the province's links with the Irish republic higher on the agenda. Sir Patrick came under pressure from Unionist MPs for saying in December that he was just a 'facilitator' of talks. Mr Peter Robinson, deputy leader of the Democratic Unionist Party, asked if the Conservative party was still a Unionist party. Sir Patrick replied that so long as a majority of Northern Ireland's population wanted to remain part of the UK it would. 'If, on the other hand, the day should come when the majority should wish some other citizenship then the UK government would not stand in the way of that,' he said.

0,FT943-5309 ,"FT943-5309 _AN-EIECYACKFT 940905   FT  05 SEP 94 / People: Business heart of west Belfast - Mackie International is to be floated in London. Owner Pat Dougan talks to William Lewis about his hopes for a post-ceasefire Northern Ireland      By WILLIAM LEWIS   Pat Dougan sees himself as a man on a mission - to bring his children home to Ulster. As owner and chief executive of Mackie International, the precision engineering firm, the head office of which lies between the Catholic Falls Road and Protestant Shankill Road, Dougan believes he and his company are living proof that Belfast's religious divide can be beaten. By overcoming sectarianism at Mackie - where 380 Catholics and Protestants are working side by side to build a prospering business - Dougan believes it may help tempt home his, and other children, to build a new peaceful Ulster. 'My children all left this country and that is a sad situation,' he says. 'They were all educated here and then cleared off.' 'I have a son in California, a son in the south of England, I have a daughter living in South Africa, a daughter living in the Republic of Ireland and one at university in Dublin,' he says. 'And mine is probably a good example of families in Northern Ireland.' Dougan was persuaded by Richard Needham, his friend and the then Northern Ireland minister, to come out of retirement and take over Mackie. Last Friday Mackie announced that it is to be quoted on the UK's Unlisted Securities Market via a placing, a move which will be followed by a full listing for the company on the London Stock Exchange. The company, which specialises in the design, manufacture and installation of textile machinery for a worldwide market, will be capitalised at around Pounds 20m. Dougan last week spoke of his excitement at the company's flotation plans and his personal commitment to the peace process in Northern Ireland. The share placing follows a sharp recovery in the company's fortunes. In 1991 sales dipped to just Pounds 6.1m and Dougan says bluntly that the company was 'dying'. However, this year the company is expected to make pre-tax profits of about Pounds 2m on turnover of around Pounds 19m. Flotation will enable Mackie to eliminate debts of Pounds 14.3m and help finance a capital spending programme. The significance of the flotation announcement is clear from the private reaction of many of Ulster's business leaders. One said that he 'would pray for Mackie's success and anything which shows the world' that after the IRA ceasefire the region has once again become investment friendly. Dougan agrees that the company's health is crucial to the well being and future of west Belfast: 'This company could become the flagship of west Belfast. If we can demonstrate to US and overseas investors that there is a work ethic here, this will allow us to develop the skills of the community.' Improvements in training facilities for local people are already under way with the building of a new university site and training centre close to the Mackie factory. For Dougan, success at Mackie is his way of 'doing his bit'. Because of its location in west Belfast, the company has a significance quite out of proportion to the size of its business activities. 'The excitement is of this whole thing going forward. If we can create lots more industry, then the opportunity will be for other families, just the same as my family, to return to Northern Ireland,' he says. 'I feel I have a contribution to make and I am trying to make it through this.' It is certainly not money which keeps the 61-year-old Catholic happily running a company which has a predominantly Protestant workforce and is situated in one of the most volatile regions of western Europe. Due to the success of Powerscreen International, another Northern Ireland company which was floated and which Dougan chaired until 1990, he now owns about Pounds 2m-worth of property and 140 acres of farmland. His current 66 per cent share holding in Mackie will fall to just under 21 per cent after flotation. Dougan insists he will stay on to 'finish the job' at Mackie. 'I am very excited by the whole prospect, I do not want to miss the success, and I do not mean in a monetary sense. I want to be here when this thing is a total success.' His declared motives are confirmed by a former colleague. 'This man is one of the old-fashioned good guys,' he says. 'By keeping that company alive, he has done more than any politician to help end the problems in west Belfast.' An adviser to Dougan says he is a 'truly dynamic individual who would think nothing of getting on an aeroplane to Africa to clinch a deal. I find him exhausting, he never stops'. Dougan says that 'the World has always been the place I have sold my wares in'. He sleeps four hours each night and works a 12-hour day, arriving at the office each morning in time for a 7am start. Such high energy levels will undoubtedly be needed to persuade City investors to put money into a company situated in an area which many of them would not even dare visit. And not without good reason. On Wednesday night, less than a mile from Mackie's factory in Springfield Road, Republicans welcomed in the IRA's cease- fire by virtually laying siege to the local RUC police station. Eventually the crowd dispersed but it was a clear reminder of how tense and volatile the mood of the local community still is. Fortunately for Mackie, Dougan's enthusiasm extends to all parts of Northern Ireland. He makes great play of the 'work ethic' in Ulster, especially among Protestants, and shrugs off the idea that violence and intimidation have ever affected him or his business. He claims never to have been threatened, and says that 'industry has not been really been affected by the troubles'. However, 'it has to be in the best interests of Northern Ireland to have a cessation of violence'. Thirty per cent of Mackie's workforce is Catholic but he says there have been only a small number of sectarian incidents at the company in recent years. For this he singles out the trade union movement for praise. 'It helped keep things calm. The trade unions have worked tirelessly to keep the peace on the shop floor,' he says. And if enthusiasm does not do the trick Dougan raises the issue of duty. He describes Mackie's flotation as 'the first opportunity the City of London has had, post the cessation of violence, to show its confidence in Ulster'. As for the politicians in Ulster, he believes they are 'generally an honest lot but community leaders should be busy building bridges'. And what if the peace in Ulster does hold? For Dougan the sky is then the limit. 'We have the potential to do sales three times what we do now,' he says.   Companies:-  Mackie International.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

After all, Germany actually went through the experience of unification five years ago. But the commentators opted for caution. Perhaps they were reluctant to explain to Dublin how, despite a common language, German unification has created internal economic, psychological and social divisions. There was little editorial dissension across the political spectrum. The leader writers agreed that the response by the British government to the ceasefire was crucial for determining the future development of the peace process. 'The peace prospects now depend on the Unionists and the British government,' wrote the left-wing Frankfurter Rundschau. The conservative Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung went further. In its editorial, the paper blamed the British government for failing to cope with the IRA, but added that the IRA had failed in its attempts to get London to stop protecting Northern Ireland. The FAZ returned to the subject a day later, arguing that 'the IRA has manoeuvred the British government into a situation of imponderables. London cannot allow the impression to be created that violence has led to the goal (for peace).' The liberal Suddeutsche Zeitung settled for scepticism. 'The prospects for a permanent peace settlement could be illusory,' the paper warned. It was left up to the small Nordbayerischer Kurier, based in Bayreuth, to use the ceasefire to reflect on other ethnic and political conflicts throughout the world. It speculated that if a solution in Northern Ireland was possible, would it be too much to expect that one day 'the Kurds and the Turks would sit at the same table, the Chinese would grant independence to Tibet, and North and South Korea might be reunited. Nothing is impossible.' But, in South Korea, the coverage of the breakthrough was particularly low-key in contrast to the copious coverage that the South Korean media gave to the civil war in the recently united Yemen earlier this year. This event was considered a warning about problems that Korea could confront if unification is achieved between North and South Korea. The South Korean media's routine coverage of the Irish story may be explained by the fact that its attention was focused on the diplomatic moves last week that could determine the fate of the Korean peninsula. The US had agreed to a meeting in the North Korean capital of Pyongyang to discuss the establishment of diplomatic relations and China gave its support to a North Korean proposal for a peace treaty with the US that could eventually lead to the removal of US troops from South Korea. Irish-Americans divided between those who foresaw the almost immediate unification of northern and southern Ireland - in five or perhaps ten years  -and those who believed the British government would merely seek to exploit the IRA ceasefire for tactical advantage. Many third and fourth generation Irish-Americans are shaky on the details of the Irish conflict. A good proportion believe that Catholics make up the majority in the north, but they are unwavering in their determination that the British must go. But one general assumption, expressed by commentators on radio and television shows last week, is that the British people are tired enough of haemorrhaging cash and casualties in Northern Ireland that they are only too eager to withdraw. And leaders of one Irish-American lobby group after another hurried to give the credit to President Bill Clinton for encouraging the peace process along by his decision to grant a visa earlier this year to Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein leader. Newspaper editorialists were more enthusiastic in their response to the news of the IRA ceasefire, though careful to warn that it was only a first step. The New York Times, under the headline 'Hope Reborn in Northern Ireland', hailed the move as 'a breakthrough - and things ought to go very badly for any faction that shatters this yearned-for ceasefire'. The paper concluded: 'In short, the permafrost seems finally to be heaving.' The Washington Post, while sharing the view that Mr Clinton deserved much of the credit, was more cautious on the future prospects. 'The ceasefire, a culmination of years of effort, is only a beginning. But if it holds it will be seen as the breakthrough concession that made real peace possible,' the Post said.

He announced the government was ready to open exploratory talks with Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, before the end of the year. In a landmark speech in Belfast in which he confirmed the government's 'working assumption' that the IRA intended a permanent end to violence, Mr Major disclosed plans for a steady easing of security measures in the province. His comments evoked a warm response in Dublin, modest encouragement from the Ulster Unionists and calls from Sinn Fein for direct negotiations not to be delayed. But Dr Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionists, accused Mr Major of 'caving in' to the IRA. Mr Major, who is to meet Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, on Monday, also emphasised his determination to accelerate negotiations on a new political settlement. In spite of the refusal of Sinn Fein explicitly to renounce violence for good, he said, the actions of the Republican movement during its six-week ceasefire pointed to a permanent end to the violence. The orders excluding Mr Gerry Adams and Mr Martin McGuinness, the two leading spokesmen for Sinn Fein, from the British mainland were lifted. All border crossings with the Republic are being reopened. Declaring that 'from this moment we are in a new phase of the peace process', the prime minister said measures marked the start of a 'full return to democratic life'. The aim was 'to make a return to violence unthinkable'. Mr Major spelled out plans to create a new Ulster assembly and laid out the principles that would guide negotiations with the Irish Republic on a constitutional framework for the province. His speech included also a commitment to a large-scale initiative to rebuild the Northern Ireland economy with a concerted effort to encourage inward investment and substantial European Union aid. Overall, it marked a carefully balanced effort to reassure the unionist community of their continuing veto over the province's constitutional future while meeting the concerns of the nationalist community. The prime minister's talks with Mr Reynolds are designed to remove the remaining obstacles to a joint framework document on relations between the two governments and between Northern Ireland and the Republic. Mr Major indicated that once the document is completed, the British side will publish also its ideas for a new, devolved assembly in Northern Ireland. The proposed assembly, which would be elected under a system of proportional voting, would give representation to all differing shades of opinion within the province. But in a warning of the difficulties to come, Mr Major said that a lasting peace could be guaranteed only when the IRA and loyalist groups had surrendered their guns and explosives. He said the London government intended to establish a joint approach with Dublin. Mr Mitchel McLaughlin, northern chairman of Sinn Fein, said he saw 'the discussion on the political issues as part of the taking the gun out of Irish politics . . . Clearly there would have to be agreement on political structures to remove the potential for political violence. That political violence arose out of a lack of agreement.'

Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, is today expected to drive home the political advantage created by the US administration's decision to offer unequivocal support for the Anglo-Irish peace initiative. In his first full-length speech since the IRA mortar attacks on Heathrow Airport, Sir Patrick will directly attack Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, saying that he has delivered only death and threats of death. The Northern Ireland secretary will tell Conservative activists in south-east England that the attacks at Heathrow Airport have enabled people to make up their minds about the republican leader's true intentions. Mr Clinton made it clear at a dinner in Washington on Thursday night that he would not authorise a repeat visa for Mr Adams to visit America until the IRA ended violence. In another policy turnaround, he has dropped earlier controversial plans to send a 'peace envoy' to Northern Ireland. The president called on 'all those who practice violence for political aims to lay down their arms'. He urged Sinn Fein and the IRA to endorse the joint declaration as 'the only way forward'. His remarks were backed up yesterday by Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, who was in Washington to join Mr Clinton for St Patrick's Day celebrations. He said the message of US support would have an important influence on the outcome of the initiative. Mr Reynolds said political leaders would have to 'show daring as never before, fortitude as never before, in bringing about the goal of peace'. Mr Adams, who on Thursday said the US administration could play an important role in the search for peace, yesterday attacked the British government for blocking progress.

0,FT943-5749 ,"FT943-5749 _AN-EICAFACOFT 940902   FT  02 SEP 94 / Northern Ireland: Business hopes for up to 30,000 jobs - Economy      By TIM COONE      DUBLIN   The IRA ceasefire has injected a mood of cautious optimism into Northern Ireland's business community, but has also triggered warnings that economic support to the province must be maintained to underpin the hoped-for peace. Business leaders and economists in Belfast estimate that a lasting peace could bring between 15,000 and 30,000 new jobs to the province over the next five years, but this would be partially offset by job losses in security-related employment. One other benefit from a peace settlement, mentioned by a number of business executives yesterday, would be that companies would find it easier to attract senior managers to the province. Mr Nigel Smyth, the director of the Confederation of British Industry (Northern Ireland), said if the ceasefire proved to be permanent, 'there will be a lot of business opportunities in the medium and long term'. He thought job growth through inward investment would quadruple, from about 500 per year to 2,000 over a two-to-three-year period, while an additional 10,000 jobs could be created in the tourist industry. 'On a per capita basis, tourist numbers here are presently a third of those in the republic and a quarter of those in Scotland,' he said. Mr Michael Smyth, an economist at the University of Ulster at Jordanstown, said the CBI figures erred on the conservative side. Tourism contributes 1.5 per cent to GDP in the province, compared with 7 per cent in the republic, so catching up with the south could create 20,000-30,000 tourism jobs in Northern Ireland. Unemployment is currently 98,000 - 13.1 per cent of the workforce. Stena Sealink, one of the main ferry operators across the Irish Sea, said interest in Ireland as a holiday destination 'is weighted very much towards the south because of the troubles in the north. Clearly, a permanent end to the violence would do no end of good.' The CBI said a climate of peace would allow manufacturing and service companies to focus their marketing on quality production. Mr Nigel Smyth said Northern Ireland businesses had one of the best records in Europe for quality awards, but that had been overshadowed by the province's image problem. The downside of the peace will be the inevitable cuts in the security forces and security-related industries. Reductions in policing levels and the prison population, and eased security in shops, offices and factories will mean less overtime, job losses, and less money going into the economy - the loss could be as much as Pounds 300m to Pounds 400m per year. The more pessimistic forecasts envisage job losses in the region of 20,000, a figure calculated by Dr Graham Gudgin of the Northern Ireland Economic Research Council. He said that over four to five years the province's economy 'will be lucky to break even on jobs'. Mr Smyth of UUJ said the number of job losses was more likely to be around 10,000 to 12,000, but he admitted there could be further indirect losses. Mr Michael Smyth said the transition to a peacetime economy would have to be managed very carefully. The government would be 'extremely foolish if it were to send any savings it made through an end to the violence straight back to the Treasury.' The CBI said any security-related savings and exchequer benefits achieved through economic growth 'should be redirected towards wealth creation and training'. The Department of Economic Development in Belfast acknowledged that there was a danger of short-term job losses. 'But any change will not be a jolt but gradual, and will be balanced by new jobs over a period. The economic development budget is very substantial at Pounds 400m and is expected to remain that way.' It said the Treasury would decide whether additional resources through savings on security could be redirected towards development. There may also be help from other sources. Last night Sir Leon Brittan, the European commissioner, said the European Union was ready to consider increasing the aid and assistance it gives to Northern Ireland. Mr Clem Parkes, chief executive of CV Carpets which is based in the north-east of the province, said: 'It is always difficult to get managers and specialists that we cannot find here to relocate from Britain. That will become much easier. And our experience is that when we do get them here they don't want to leave.'   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Mr Liam Cleere, organiser, said: 'If Israel and the Palestinians can settle their differences; if South Africa can do it; if the Berlin Wall can come down - then Northern Ireland can be sorted out as well.' Mr Cleere, an Irish bricklayer living in Kilburn, north London, set up the Rally for Peace Movement after the Warrington bomb blast which killed two children in March. He claimed yesterday that the non-political, non-sectarian movement had 5,000 members, almost all of them Irish people living in Britain appalled by the violence in Ulster. Yesterday's protest over the latest week of violence was no mass rally - the Home Office gave permission only for Mr Cleere and five colleagues to hold banners in the square. The pro-Republican Irish Freedom Movement staged a demonstration a few yards from the peace protesters demanding 'Irish freedom'. Troops Out demonstrators used similar tactics to disrupt the movement's first rally for peace, attended by 2,000, in Hyde Park about a month after the Warrington bombing.

Their decision, which could result in a lengthy phase of political instability in the republic, raises concerns about the momentum of the Northern Ireland peace process. The resignations were followed later in the day by that of Mr Harry Whelehan as president of the High Court. He said he was quitting because 'the judiciary must enjoy total and unquestioning public respect'. Mr Reynolds, in his resignation speech, told the parliament: 'You win some - and you lose some. But, above all, throughout my life I have been delighted to have been a risk-taker.' Former attorney-general Mr Whelehan's judicial appointment triggered the collapse of the 22-month old coalition on Wednesday. Labour had accused Mr Reynolds of misleading parliament over the delayed extradition to Northern Ireland of a Catholic priest, later convicted of child abuse. Mr Whelehan's resignation introduced an unexpected twist to a day of high political drama in Dublin, raising the prospect that Mr Reynolds might try to hang on to the party leadership. Last night his position as party leader was still unclear after it emerged that a meeting of the Fianna Fail parliamentary party had not accepted his resignation. A meeting to resolve the party leadership issue is expected to be held tomorrow. Two candidates last night declared their intention to fight for the leadership. Mrs Maire Geoghegan-Quinn, the justice minister, said that she would be offering her candidacy if Mr Reynolds were to step down. Mr Bertie Ahern, until yesterday the finance minister, also announced he planned to stand. Ireland, for the time being, is in the hands of a caretaker government. With little prospect of an early resolution to the crisis, there are growing doubts about the pace of talks between Dublin and London on the vital framework document for a constitutional settlement to Northern Ireland's political problems. In London, Mr John Major, who was informed of Mr Reynolds' resignation during a morning cabinet meeting, wrote to thank him for his contribution to the peace process. Downing Street said the prime minister was sorry that his 'extremely good' working relationship with his former Irish counterpart was at an end. He intended to speak to Mr Reynolds before the end of the week. But as Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican Army, used a visit to London to accuse Britain of dragging its feet on efforts to forge a lasting settlement in Ulster, senior UK ministers insisted that the peace process would continue. Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, told parliament the process did not 'depend on any individual'. The government would 'press ahead' with exploratory talks with Sinn Fein and loyalist representatives next month. Downing Street said the two governments were 'close to agreement' on the framework document which would form the basis of future talks involving Ulster's main political parties. Mr Adams appeared sceptical. The process of trying to reach agreement had been going on 'for months and months', he said. The prospect of a protracted search for a new Irish government - and possibly an early general election - could dangerously delay the joint framework document. In the confusion generated by the day's resignations, however, it was not clear that a new general election would even be necessary. Mr Dick Spring, the Labour leader, said he had 'an open mind' on all possibilities for forming another coalition.

The move came in spite of a meeting described as 'productive' between fishermen's representatives and ministers. The federation said it had lodged documents at the High Court in London to support an application to suspend the legislation, due to come into force next January. Under an European Community agreement Britain must cut fishing by 19 per cent by 1996. The government has said it was willing to consider altering details of the proposals to limit the number of days fishermen can spend at sea and yesterday Mrs Gillian Shephard, the agriculture minister, Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, and Mr Michael Jack, fisheries minister, met representatives of the English, Welsh, Scottish and Northern Ireland fishing industries. The industry has been asked for ideas by the end of September and ministers will continue to meet fishermen and visit ports. The federation pointed out that ministers did not rule out bringing forward Pounds 25m for decommissioning to be phased in over three years. Mrs Shephard said the meeting was a genuine attempt to see if the government's days-at-sea proposals could be modified to meet the industry's concerns while conserving fish stocks.

0,FT934-2215 ,"FT934-2215 _AN-DLOCPAC6FT 931215   FT  15 DEC 93 / N Ireland executives foresee a peace dividend: Jimmy Burns and Tim Coone report on industry leaders' opinions      By JIMMY BURNS and TIM COONE   Business leaders in Northern Ireland expect an economic boost to the province's economy if there is peace, and are ready to see concessions made in talks that could later include Sinn Fein. These are the overall findings of a Financial Times survey published today. It is a rare snapshot of the attitudes of Northern Ireland's businessmen and women on the political situation and the paramilitary violence in the province. Since the troubles began 25 years ago, the business community has in the main kept its political views private for the good reason that its factories and offices, or the executives themselves, could become targets of the paramilitaries. A majority of the companies insisted on completing questionnaires anonymously. A handful of those contacted by phone, however, volunteered to expand on their answers. One senior executive said of devolution: 'This is absolutely necessary because without it we will never have the politicians with the calibre we need to lead us.' Another commented: 'If the management of a business had been in conflict with its trade unions for 25 years, that business would have gone under a long time ago. 'My advice to the politicians is that they must sit down together and talk, and talk and talk, because that way you can always find there are ways of moving forward.' Only 4 per cent of executives said they had ever considered relocating to the mainland because of the violence, although the chief executive of one leading employer in the province admitted that relocation had been considered. Virtually all said that the violence had not significantly affected the day-to-day running of their businesses. But they all saw an economic dividend in prospect if there were peace, with 90 per cent anticipating a positive effect on business and entrepreneurial opportunities. They differed more on the precise new structures that would maximise this peace dividend. Only 5 per cent would continue with the present political structure while 57 per cent wanted stronger devolved power structures and 27 per cent wanted stronger north-south links. Only 4 per cent saw the best economic prospects in a united Ireland. On the political level the respondents were divided in assessment of the likelihood of a settlement, with optimists roughly matching pessimists. They also disagreed about the extent of the concessions that should be offered to achieve a settlement. About two-thirds of the executives thought neither the IRA nor the loyalist paramilitaries could be defeated militarily. Yet a third supported acknowledging the aspiration of Irish unity, and 61 per cent would concede enhanced north-south structures for economic co-operation. But only 20 per cent would back such structures for enhancing political co-operation and 14 per cent were against any of these concessions being made. Ninety-five per cent would allow Sinn Fein to the negotiating table: 7 per cent immediately; 29 per cent as soon as the IRA announced it would abandon violence; and 59 per cent after a substantial period of non-violence. Just as encouraging for the nationalist position was the fact that 61 per cent supported the position taken by Dublin that there should be separate referendums for north and south. Only a tiny minority of companies feel Sinn Fein should be indefinitely excluded from the political process. The survey covered most of the leading private-sector employers in Northern Ireland. The respondents together account for almost 25 per cent of the workforce employed in the private sector. It was conducted on the basis of strict confidentiality. Nevertheless, the fear of retribution from paramilitary groups was given as the reason for not participating by 10 companies. Such nervousness - one multi-national authorised its local senior executive to participate in the poll only after a tortuous series of consultations at board level - suggests that the survey may underestimate the extent to which businessmen and women in Northern Ireland consider themselves threatened by terrorism. The chief executives of 80 companies were approached, of which 56 responded. Many said they were taking part in order to contribute to the current political debate. Overall, almost a third of their business is conducted with mainland Britain, almost 40 per cent within Northern Ireland, a quarter overseas, and only 7 per cent with the Irish Republic, broadly reflecting the pattern of trade in the province. The poll was carried out on Thursday and Friday of last week.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- The value of peace: Ulster business says it's time to make concessions  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Fifty-six chief executives of Northern Ireland's leading companies in the manufacturing, construction, financial services and distribution sectors participated in this survey by the Financial Times.

His comments drew immediate criticism from the UK government, unionist MPs and politicians in the republic. Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, expressed surprise that Mr Reynolds should breach the confidentiality of the negotiations and said it would 'make things difficult for both sides'. Mr Reynolds, interviewed on BBC Radio at the weekend, said London had agreed that Dublin should have a role in future all-Ireland institutions covering areas such as tourism and transport - a move northern unionists believe is a step towards a united Ireland. The former Irish prime minister, forced to resign over a judicial appointment scandal last month, said an all-Ireland body would have executive powers and be drawn from representatives in Dublin and a future parliament in Northern Ireland. Mr Reynolds also said substantive talks involving British ministers and Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, should begin now and troops should be taken off the streets. He said Downing Street's precondition that weapons be handed in or destroyed could seriously threaten the ceasefire. According to Mr Reynolds the all-Ireland body is among proposals in a new framework document which London and Dublin hope will form the basis for all-party talks on the province's future. The document is due to be published early next year and is expected to be discussed when Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, meets Mr John Bruton, the republic's new prime minister, in London next week. Mr Reynolds's comments are widely seen as a bid to sour Mr Bruton's relations with the unionists and demonstrate to nationalists that it was the outgoing Fianna Fail led coalition that had secured concessions on cross-border bodies. Mr Ken Maginnis, Ulster Unionist MP, accused Mr Reynolds of 'destructive dialogue' and seeking to weave a web of suspicion by giving the IRA the impression that an 'embryo united Ireland' was within reach. Mr Peter Robinson, East Belfast MP for the hardline Democratic Unionists, called on Mr Major to provide 'the clearest clarification' of the state of negotiations, warning the government that it was 'heading for confrontation' with the unionist community in Northern Ireland. British officials and Sinn Fein will meet for more exploratory dialogue at Stormont today when the issue of guns and explosives is likely to be raised again.   Countries:-  IEZ  Ireland, EC.

The company, whose September flotation on the Unlisted Securities Market was hailed as a sign of growing business confidence in Northern Ireland following the IRA ceasefire, said it had won orders worth Pounds 9m - almost matching its total first half sales. Mr Pat Dougan, chief executive and holder of 20 per cent of the equity, said the orders would both boost sales and secure the jobs of the group's 380 workers. 'We will press ahead with an Pounds 8m project to install new equipment, which could lead to another 50 jobs,' he said. The announcement was welcomed in west Belfast, the UK's worst unemployment blackspot, where Mackie is the only surviving precision engineering group. 'The company looked as though it was on the way out a few years ago, but it has been turned round successfully,' said Mr Joe Hendron, MP for west Belfast. In the two years to 1991, sales dropped from Pounds 30m to Pounds 6m before the Northern Ireland Office helped rescue the company and appointed Mr Dougan.

The three main opposition parties, Fine Gael, the Progressive Democrats and Democratic Left, have been concerned that Mr Reynolds, in pushing hard for an accommodation of nationalist aspirations in the joint declaration, would alienate unionist opinion in Northern Ireland and exacerbate political tensions and violence there. Ms Mary Harney, leader of the Progressive Democrats who has been one of Mr Reynolds' sharpest critics, described the declaration as 'fair and balanced'. She added: 'Over the past number of weeks I and my party consistently expressed our concerns that a peace formula might be attempted to satisfy the men of violence at the expense of constitutional unionists in particular. I am happy to acknowledge that my concerns have not come to pass.' Mr John Bruton, the Fine Gael leader, congratulated the two prime ministers in reaching an agreement. Highlighting the British government's acknowledgement of the right to self-determination in the island of Ireland, he said: 'In view of this declaration, there can be no conceivable justification for any organisation, like the IRA, to continue to attempt to coerce the British people by arms into agreeing to something that they have already plainly agreed to in this declaration.' He was concerned at a 'lack of clear timetables or mechanisms' for the resumption of inter-party talks and hoped that the formula for dropping the republic's constitutional claim to Northern Ireland in the context of an overall settlement 'would not be used as an excuse to defer all action on constitutional reforms into the indeterminate future'. Mr Prionsias de Rossa, leader of Democratic Left which in an earlier guise was the political wing of the official IRA before the organisation split in the 1970s, paid tribute 'to the drafting skills of some of the best brains in both the Irish and British public services'. He said the British government 'has gone as far as it is politically possible to go to meet republican demands in regard to self-determination'. He added: 'If the IRA spurns this opportunity, responsibility for the continuing violence will be seen to rest totally with them.' Mr de Rossa also said that Mr Reynolds 'has gone further than he or any of his predecessors have been prepared to go in the past' by making a solemn written commitment to drop the republic's constitutional claim to Northern Ireland as part of an overall political settlement. Mr Bruton warned against establishing too many bodies for discussing issues in the north. On the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, he said there should not be 'competing institutions trying to solve the same problem - creating needless misunderstandings and misinterpretations'.

0,FT942-5494 ,"FT942-5494 _AN-EFEASAA1FT 940604   FT  04 JUN 94 / IRA outdone by tragedy: Helicopter deaths leave hole in intelligence operations      By JIMMY BURNS, MICHAEL CASSELL and Our Belfast Correspondent   In human terms the helicopter crash on the Mull of Kintyre was a bigger blow to Northern Ireland's security forces than any single terrorist act since the Troubles began 25 years ago. Beyond the grieving, a complex debate was under way about the precise implications that such a loss would have on Britain's ability to deal effectively with the IRA. With the exception of the four RAF crew, all the victims were in important positions in intelligence - the most crucial area of counter-terrorist operations. They included 10 members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch, nine army officers linked to military intelligence and six members of the Northern Ireland Office, among them representatives of MI5. The most senior of the named victims was the RUC's assistant chief constable Brian Fitzsimons. As head of the RUC's 'E' Department, Mr Fitz-simons was responsible for co-ordinating intelligence gathering with other agencies and police units. His department controls specialist SAS-trained surveillance units and runs undercover agents. Also killed was Det Chief Supt Maurice Neilly, head of Special Branch (Northern Region) which covers one of the traditional republican strongholds in the Londonderry area. Other regional middle-ranking special branch officers were killed. Combating the loss caused by the crash will be high on the agenda at the next meeting of the low-profile Province Executive Committee, the body in charge of day-to day operation of anti-terrorist activity. The committee comprises the RUC deputy chief constable (operations), the army commander of land forces and high-ranking intelligence officers. It emerged last night that Mr Fitzsimons served on the committee. One senior RUC source spoke yesterday of the 'tragic act of God' which 'had done what the IRA had failed to do for 25 years'. This view was echoed by Mr Jeremy Hanley, armed forces minister, who said: 'They are going to be very difficult to replace.' Other senior anti-terrorist sources were more measured in their assessment of the longer-term implications of the crash. One insisted that all the information known to the victims was 'fully documented and computerised'. Mr Fitzsimons was due to leave the RUC shortly to take up a post as chief of security for Ulster Bank. His deputy - who was not involved in the crash - and other officers of similar grade are understood to have been briefed about some key Special Branch operations. Many senior RUC officers have specialist anti-terrorist expertise. As one anti-terrorist source said yesterday: 'There will be a slight hiccup, but otherwise people should be able to rearrange their desks fairly smoothly.' Within the army, Northern Ireland operations have for years involved relatively short-term postings for intelligence personnel. Replacement of those killed is also likely to involve minimum disruption. At MI5's London headquarters replacements would have been lined up by as soon as last night. In the coming days one of the top priorities for people such as Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, and Sir Hugh Annesley, chief constable of the RUC - who both said the deaths had been a shattering blow - will be to regain the propaganda initiative from the IRA as the peace process enters a potentially crucial stage. The crash was not the result of sabotage, and no security was breached by the terrorists. But security sources fully expect that IRA leaders will now test the operational resilience of the counter-terrorist effort as it comes to terms with the tragic human loss.

The Greens and the three main parties are to fight all the constituencies in Great Britain. However, candidates of the Natural Law party, which represents followers of the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, are standing in every UK constituency - making the party the first to fight every seat, either for Europe or Westminster. The Tories have just one candidate in Northern Ireland where three MEPs are elected by proportional representation. Boundary changes have created six more UK seats and left only 17 of the present seats in England and Wales unchanged. The eight in Scotland and three in Northern Ireland are unaffected. The Scottish National party is fighting all the Scottish seats and Plaid Cymru all five in Wales. The Liberal party, which includes those who chose not to join the Liberal Democrats, has 17 candidates. Well-known names nominated include former health minister Mrs Edwina Currie at Bedfordshire and Milton Keynes. Ms Pauline Green, who leads Labour's European parliament group, is fighting for her marginal London North seat on unchanged boundaries. But Tory leader Sir Christopher Prout has been favoured by alterations leaving him with an apparently safer Herefordshire and Shropshire seat.

It says recovery in these areas will be fuelled by export growth and increased investment rather than an upturn in consumer spending. The centre predicts that the most dynamic regions will be East Anglia and the south-west - areas which the centre regards as part of the south. GDP in East Anglia is expected to have grown by 3.2 per cent between 1992 and 1994, and by 2.8 per cent in the south-west against a national average of 2.3 per cent. Growth in Wales and the west Midlands is put at 2.4 per cent. GDP growth in London is put at just 1.5 per cent, although the financial services sector is set to expand for the first time since the recession. The south is forecast to see more employment, although most other areas are likely to see an increase in joblessness. Growth and job prospects in the east Midlands, the Yorkshire area and Humberside will be handicapped by pit closures, the report adds. In the north of England, growth has been been undermined by the decision of Nissan, the Japanese car manufacturer, to cut output and by the redundancies at Swan Hunter on Tyneside. Scotland and Northern Ireland, meanwhile, are said to be vulnerable because of their reliance on state employment which is likely to decline as part of the squeeze on public spending. Looking to 2002, the report says the outlook is more optimistic. National GDP is set to grow by 2.5 per cent, while job creation is likely to increase by 0.5 per cent. The authors say that the devaluation of sterling and lower interest rates should provide the long-term stimulus to finally end the recession. Regional Economic Outlook.

0,FT932-15978 ,"FT932-15978 _AN-DDHB2AB0FT 930408   FT  08 APR 93 / Major's vision of an end to the Ulster troubles: An initiative by the PM for round-table talks      By RALPH ATKINS   WHEREAS others can only see fog, centuries-old problems and irreconcilable differences, Mr John Major had a grandiose vision yesterday on his tour of Northern Ireland. 'I believe the way ahead is clearer than many people may imagine,' he said. Everybody in Northern Ireland, the Irish Republic and in Britain wants peace, he said. Ipso facto, round-table talks on the province should resume as soon as possible. He may have been naive but the immediate effect of his speech was, on balance, positive. Talks will probably start after next month's local elections in the province - only the Rev Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionist Party appeared unhappy with that prospect last night. Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, may meet Unionist and nationalist leaders beforehand in order to pre-empt disputes over procedural points. But the government's only fresh contribution to breaking the political deadlock that has gripped the province since the 'troubles' started nearly 25 years ago was in one line at the end of Mr Major's speech: 'When they talk, we will put proposals before the participants. We must press ahead.' There were no official clues about what such government proposals might involve. But indications from Whitehall are that the package will be a synthesis of ideas already discussed by Unionist and nationalist parties during previous talks that ended in November, rather than a fresh approach. If Mr Major is to do more than act as a catalyst to talks that end, once more, in failure, the government's proposals will almost certainly have to bridge a divide that has stymied a trail of government initiatives over the past two decades. Any signs that Mr Major has found a magic formula that has proved elusive before are scant. As suspicious as ever of the UK government giving ground to the nationalists, Mr Paisley, yesterday castigated Mr Major for suggesting there was a political solution to terrorism. He wants tougher security and an end to the Irish Republic's constitutional claim on the north that gives 'oxygen' to the republican paramilitaries. More subtly, more moderate Ulster Unionist MPs were urging that Northern Ireland be treated like any other part of the UK - code for excluding the Irish Republic from any practical involvement. In contrast, Mr John Hume, leader of the mainly Roman Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party, wants Northern Ireland's political machinery set firmly in an all-Ireland context. Such complexities could emerge in discussions on how talks resume. Unionists want low-key bilateral talks focused on restoring democracy to the province and attach priority to Dublin giving way on its constitutional claims. The SDLP will want assurances that there will not be interim agreement on any proposals until the whole agenda has been resolved - including Northern Ireland's position within the British Isles. Building on public revulsion at recent terrorist atrocities, Mr Major appeared to have won enough goodwill to ensure such obstacles to talks will be overcome. But it will only be a return to where the politicians were last November.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P9111 Executive Offices.     P8651 Political Organizations.

0,FT943-3709 ,"FT943-3709 _AN-EIMDOACJFT 940913   FT  13 SEP 94 / CBI hopes for Pounds 350m Ulster peace dividend      By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent   Peace in Northern Ireland could release Pounds 350m a year from the security budget within five years to help economic development in the province, the Confederation of British Industry says today. A report prepared by the CBI Northern Ireland over the past six months and released two weeks into the IRA ceasefire says a permanent cessation of violence and a political settlement could have a profound impact on the local economy. The CBI calls on the British government to develop a strategy which maintains existing public-expenditure levels but gradually redirects spending on law and order into a programme of wealth creation to offset job losses among security-related activities. The CBI warns that cuts in expenditure on security could mean substantial job losses and a sharp reduction in the number of army personnel in the province. Security spending in the province was almost Pounds 1bn last year, nearly three times the per-capita level in the rest of Britain. The knock-on effect could also mean extensive job losses. But the CBI also estimates that any losses could be offset by the creation of 29,000 jobs and up to 20,000 vocational training places by 1999. It says, however, that significantly higher levels of employment growth might be feasible given a revival of the province's declining manufacturing base. The report suggests some jobs would come as a result of a rise in inward investment. In the past 20 years external corporate investors have created 500 jobs a year in Ulster and the CBI says this could now rise within two or three years to at least 2,000. Other jobs, it says, should also emerge in the tourism industry, about 3,000 in the short term and up to 10,000 in the longer term. Any rise in funding for education and training might add another 1,500 jobs by 1999 and there would also be more in transport infrastructure, housing improvement and health and environmental services. Mr Doug Riley, chairman of CBI Northern Ireland, said that Ulster's business community believed the province was 'entering a new era' which would have to be built on co-operation. The CBI says the government will have to develop clear, long-term policies for public expenditure in full partnership with the private sector if it is to reinforce the benefits of peace. Maintaining high public spending in the province will be essential. Peace - a Challenging New Era. CBI Northern Ireland, Fanum House, 108 Great Victoria St, Belfast BT2 7PD. Free.

In the wake of the assertion by Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, that the British government may never be in a position to say it accepts that the IRA ceasefire is permanent, Mr Reynolds told the Dublin parliament he was convinced that the end of IRA violence was 'real and for good'. He said he would be in touch with Mr John Major later this week to explain 'that we believe the peace process should be consolidated and underpinned at the earliest possible moment because if any vacuums develop, the process could be endangered - and we don't want to see that happen'. Mr Reynolds also said he was 'encouraged' by signs of a loyalist ceasefire. There was fresh optimism in Northern Ireland last night within the fringes of the paramilitaries after the Government allowed loyalist leaders into the top-security Maze Prison on Monday for talks about a possible ceasefire with UDA and UVF inmates. Mr Reynolds, replying to a series of questions on the search for peace in Northern Ireland, told the parliament of his forthcoming contact with Mr Major: 'I will be making the point that I believe the time has come now, into the sixth week of the cessation of violence, to accelerate the response of the British government. 'Also that the British government should use whatever pressures they can in relation to an end of violence by loyalist paramilitaries.' But he also made clear that Sinn Fein had been told that Dublin disapproved of the steep rise in punishment beatings carried out by republican hardliners since the ceasefire began on September 1. Mr Reynolds said it was expected that a framework for all-party, cross-border talks would be completed ahead of a meeting soon with Mr Major. 'The intention is that the discussions and negotiations on the document will be over before we fix a definitive date for the meeting,' he said.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

The row over Northern Ireland's future that erupted on Thursday may signal the end of a common approach between the two governments. As if conceding that talks will not re-start in the autumn, as envisaged by the UK, the Irish government is floating the possibility of the two governments going over the heads of local politicians. Mr Dick Spring, Irish foreign minister, has gone further. He has raised the idea of 'joint sovereignty' in Ulster. He was slapped down on Thursday by Sir Patrick. Mr Spring had broken the 'cardinal principle' that agreement must be reached by consent. The squall reflects shifts in thinking both in London and Dublin. The British government has become more overtly unionist. More importantly, the prime minister departed from the usual script - that Northern Ireland should remain part of the UK so long as a majority of its population wished to remain - to say he was behind the union. The shift may be partly because of the Conservatives' increased reliance on the votes of Ulster Unionist MPs at Westminster. More probably, it is just that the frustration of failing to re-start talks has provoked frank opinions. Irish officials believe unionists must not be allowed to make the running. But Mr Spring is also keen to make a mark for his Irish Labour party, the junior partner in the Irish government coalition. There is a desire to build on the 1985 Anglo-Irish agreement which gave Dublin a token say in the affairs of the north. What will happen next? The most optimistic scenario is that unionists will be so encouraged by the UK's apparently hardened line that they will re-enter talks, dropping their insistance that the Irish government has first to modify its constitutional claim on the north. Perversely, a row between the British and Irish governments may soothe unionist fears about their constitutional future. More realistically, however, the Irish government's remarks will only further delay the resumption of talks. So Mr Spring's remarks could become self-fulfilling and the only way ahead would be for the two governments to come together and map out a future for Northern Ireland. The lesson he and Mr Reynolds have learned is that finding agreement between the two governments is as hard as finding a deal between the province's politicians.

0,FT942-6791 ,"FT942-6791 _AN-EE2AAAA3FT 940528   FT  28 MAY 94 / Differences emerge on Anglo-Irish blueprint      By DAVID OWEN   London and Dublin are at odds over whether the framework agreement they hope to complete for July's Anglo-Irish summit should contain an explicit commitment by Dublin to rescind its constitutional claim over Northern Ireland. Details of these differences emerged as Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, emphasised in a speech in Oxford that a settlement must win clear approval from the province's nationalists as well as its unionists. The two sides have made good progress on the document, which is designed to help forge a durable political settlement in the province by spurring political talks involving Ulster's main constitutional parties. But there are believed to be two potential sticking-points. The first concerns Dublin's move away from its claim on Ulster, and the other is over whether the agreement should set out a specific blueprint for Northern Ireland's future, as Dublin prefers, or simply provide a starting-point for new talks, as London wishes. Speaking just 24 hours after an informal meeting at Downing Street with Mr John Major, Mr Reynolds said that consent was needed by 'both traditions to a political framework that accommodates them both'. Just as Dublin had accepted that Irish unity could only come through consent, so unionists must accept that 'if Northern Ireland is for some time to come to remain under the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom . . . then they too must win the consent of northern nationalists to the democratic arrangements and structures under which this will happen'. He added: 'The total domination of one community by another is no longer acceptable as a basis for being governed.' Hinting that Dublin may adopt a tough stance in behind-the-scenes talks on the framework agreement, Mr Reynolds argued that the two governments' acceptance of the principle of consent had 'implications' for the 1920 Government of Ireland Act, as well as for Ireland's constitution. Though Dublin would support proposals for constitutional changes that 'fully reflect' the principle of consent in Northern Ireland, the Irish Supreme Court had already decided that the articles enshrining its territorial claim were 'fully compatible' with the country's obligation in international law. But Mr Reynolds combined his tough defence of the interests of northern nationalists with a strong condemnation of republican and loyalist violence. If violence continued, then Sinn Fein's quarrel would be 'not only with the British government but with the rest of the Irish people', he said. He called on unionists to tell loyalist paramilitaries that there was 'no valid excuse or justification for continued violence of any kind'.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

0,FT941-17195 ,"FT941-17195 _AN-EAFCSAAGFT 940106   FT  06 JAN 94 / Major reshuffles team after Yeo's resignation      By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent   Mr John Major, the prime minister, was forced into an unplanned government reshuffle yesterday after Mr Tim Yeo, the environment minister, resigned over an extramarital affair. Mr Yeo's job as one of three deputies to Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, went to Mr Robert Atkins. Mr Atkins moves sideways from the minister of state's job in the Northern Ireland office. He will be replaced by Mr Michael Ancram, the junior Northern Ireland minister, who has co-ordinated talks between the government and Ulster's non-violent political parties. Downing Street said Mr Ancram would retain responsibility for the talks to avoid a hiatus in the Northern Ireland peace process. Mr Tim Smith, the MP for Beaconsfield, will take over Mr Ancram's less sensitive responsibilities for economic policy. Mr Yeo's resignation was announced less than 24 hours after he declared that he would not be driven out of office by media attacks on his behaviour. He changed his mind after the executive of his South Suffolk constituency association formally criticised his affair with a Conservative councillor who had a child by him last year. The association stopped short of seeking Mr Yeo's resignation, but urged him to reflect on 'widespread disappointment' expressed by local party members. The statement echoed claims by senior Conservative backbenchers that Mr Yeo's behaviour conflicted with the government's 'back to basics' campaign, which emphasises traditional values. Downing Street sought to limit the political damage by distancing Mr Major from calls by cabinet colleagues for a reduction in the number of single mothers. But the affair is deeply embarrassing to Mr Major, who was aware of Mr Yeo's relationship before it was disclosed in the media last month. The prime minister refrained from giving open support to Mr Yeo, but his decision not to seek the minister's resignation was criticised by some Conservative backbenchers. In his resignation letter, Mr Yeo said his personal life 'has never in any way prevented me from discharging my duties as a minister'. However, he said he believed he had no option other than to step down 'to concentrate on uniting my constituency party organisation'. Mr Yeo said yesterday he was 'sad' to leave the government. In his reply, Mr Major said that Mr Yeo had been 'a most effective minister'. The prime minister said he was 'sorry' that Mr Yeo's talents would not be available to the government. Mr Major also said that he hoped Mr Yeo's talents 'may be used again at a future stage', raising the prospect that he may return to the government after a period on the back benches. The prime minister's decision to limit the reshuffle to three ministers confirms that a wider ministerial shake-up is likely in the summer. Mr Atkins, a friend of Mr Major, is a former sports minister who shares the prime minister's enthusiasm for cricket. He has previous experience of the Environment Department, which will ease the transition.

He emphasised the government's cautious approach to the ceasefire declared last week by announcing that Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein leader, would continue to be barred from visiting Britain. The prime minister, speaking on BBC television, said Mr Adams would remain subject to a three-year exclusion order barring him from visiting the UK mainland, and that he did not expect this to be revoked 'in the next few months'. Mr Major's caution was in sharp contrast to that of his Irish counterpart, Mr Albert Reynolds, who is expected to meet Mr Adams this week to discuss Sinn Fein's participation in the Dublin-based Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, which would bring the Irish nationalist movement into talks with political parties in the republic. Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, will today meet Sir Patrick Mayhew, Britain's Northern Ireland secretary to try to resolve the differences between the governments' judgments of how to respond to the ceasefire. An Irish foreign ministry spokesman said: 'We understand the caution of the British government, but we hope that it is going to be cleared up shortly and that the meeting hopefully will contribute to that.' Sir Patrick said Irish nationalists had not yet made it clear that the violence had been permanently ended. Unionist politicians in Northern Ireland yesterday maintained their pressure on London to respond cautiously to the IRA's declaration. Mr Chris McGimpsey, honorary secretary of the Ulster Unionist party (UUP), said a cessation of IRA terrorism was simply a logistical statement whereas a permanent end to violence was a political statement. Mr Peter Robinson, deputy leader of the Democratic Unionist party, said the ceasefire terms had 'a get-out clause to renew the violence if they do not get concessions they are looking for.'

0,FT922-8302 ,"FT922-8302 _AN-CENCNAAZFT 920514   FT  14 MAY 92 / Survey of World Electricity (14): Power line under the ocean  -Ulster is no longer an electricity island      By JIM FLANAGAN   THE ink was barely dry on the documents transferring ownership of Northern Ireland's four power stations to the private sector when the province's annual round of electricity price increases was announced. A 4 per cent average rise in line with inflation was hardly surprising but it handed detractors of privatisation a fresh platform for a bitter attack on Ulster energy policy. It underlined the fact that the Government is in the process of privatising the power industry in spite of fierce opposition from consumer groups, unionist and nationalist politicians and trade unions fearing massive job cuts and higher tariffs. Northern Ireland Electricity (NIE), an amalgamation of four small municipal authorities less than 20 years ago, ceased to exist as a public utility on April 1. Its power stations were taken over and all of NIE's obligations and employees moved to a new company, NIE plc. The new company, Ulster's biggest, continues to have responsibility for providing a reliable supply of electricity and controls the scheduling and despatch of all generating units. The new power station owners have to compete for the right to sell electricity to NIE. It in turn has a statutory duty to operate the system in a manner facilitating competition in generation and supply. NIE Plc is due for flotation in November. In selling the power stations the over-riding concern of Ministers was to inject as much competition as possible. Historically, NIE's main problems have been its dependence on costly fuel imports, isolation from national grids and its small size - peak winter demand throughout the province was a mere 1,447MW last year. The utility's 70 per cent dependence on oil led to big Government subsidies in the early 1980s but modest profitability has been restored in recent years as fuel costs have stabilised. It could be argued that privatisation has provided an answer to all the problems at a stroke and raised Pounds 353m for the Treasury's coffers. British Gas has bought Ballylumford power station at Larne, County Antrim, for Pounds 132.4m. The 1,080 MW oil-fired plant meets the demand of almost half of NIE's 600,000 customers. The new owners will be converting the station to run on natural gas by 1997. Premier Transco, a new British Gas subsidiary, will be building, owning and operating a pipeline to carry natural gas into Northern Ireland from Scotland. Ballylumford will be the first user but the pipeline will also service other suppliers wishing to bring gas to Ulster consumers. Another subsidiary, Premier Energy Suppliers, is being established to market the product in Northern Ireland. Both the pipeline and power station conversion project have attracted European Community backing. Terms have been agreed but British Gas has still to complete a detailed undersea survey and complete negotiations with Bord Gais Eireann in Dublin regarding the shared on-shore pipeline in Scotland. Applied Energy Services and Tractebel, an American/Belgian consortium, have formed a joint venture, NIGEN, to acquire Kilroot power station near Carrickfergus and the Belfast West plant for a total of Pounds 214m. However, the deal had not been finalised by the April 1 deadline. The Department of Economic Development has taken over responsibility for running the plants while NIE is providing a payroll system allowing wages to be paid. NIGEN has made it clear that an agreement with the Government has been realised and the delay is due to 'technical reasons'. It said: 'It is not because they can't raise the money. It is the process involved in project financing which has led to the hold-up'. NIGEN has Pounds 25m in place and is in the process of placing the remaining capital with a syndicate of international banks. Kilroot, Ulster's most modern station, is a dual coal and oil firing plant with a capacity of 520MW satisfying about one third of the province's total demand. Belfast West, the province's oldest station, is a 240MW coal-fired plant covering about 10 per cent of demand. Coolkeeragh power station at Londonderry, the only plant in the west of the province, has been acquired in a management-employee-buy-out for Pounds 6.5m. The 420MW oil-fired station also meets about 10 per cent of demand but is strategically important because of its geographical location. The industry's competitive goals will be strengthened towards the end of the 1990s when an electricity inter-connector between Scotland and Ulster comes on stream. Scottish Power and NIE reached agreement on the Pounds 170m project before the power station sales. The cable will be capable of transmitting 250MW of power and provide another mainland link. There is also renewed interest in restoring the inter-connector with the Republic of Ireland, out of commission since being repeatedly targeted by the IRA in the 1970s. NIE and the Republic's Electricity Supply Board have announced plans for a small power link providing back-up in the north-west of the country. With the new power station owners likely to figure in any competition for future NIE generating requirements, it seems the industry is well placed to meet demand, currently growing at 4 per cent a year. The whole scenario throws a question mark over the exploitation of lignite, the province's only indigenous source of fuel. It has been found in huge quantities and studies suggest a lignite-fired power plant would be viable. But given the environmental implication of such a project and the plans already announced for meeting future requirements, lignite is unlikely to be developed in the forseeable future. The government has insisted that the privatisation is in the best interests of tax payers and energy users. But consumers will judge the restructuring of the industry by the bills dropping through their letterboxes. Mr Geoffrey Horton, the new electricity regulator appointed by the Government to protect consumers rights after privatisation, is likely to be a busy man.  The Financial Times   London Page IX  "

He promoted Mr Jonathan Aitken, a long-standing backbench Euro-sceptic, and Mr Michael Mates, who ran Mr Michael Heseltine's leadership campaign. But the largest shake-up of government posts since 1979, including the cabinet moves, hit an unexpected obstacle when Mrs Edwina Currie turned down the chance to return to government. The sharpest promotion is that of Mr Stephen Dorrell, who moves from junior health minister to become financial secretary to the Treasury. Other new Treasury ministers are Sir John Cope, a Tory party deputy chairman previously a minister, and Mr Anthony Nelson, who joins the government as economic secretary. Mr Major has appointed some longer-serving MPs whose abilities languished on the back benches during the Thatcher years. These include Mr Nigel Forman, parliamentary private secretary to Mr Nigel Lawson as chancellor, who becomes a junior education minister, and Mr Charles Wardle, who goes to the Home Office. Mr Aitken becomes a defence minister while Mr Mates, chairman of the cross-party Anglo-Irish Group and a former army colonel, becomes a minister at the Northern Ireland Office. The most rapid promotion goes to Sir Derek Spencer QC, elected Conservative MP for Brighton Pavilion last week, who collected a knighthood on being appointed solicitor-general. Sir Derek, 56, parliamentary private secretary to the attorney-general in 1986-87, was MP for Leicester South from 1983 until the 1987 general election when he lost the seat to Labour by 1,877 votes. The reshuffle is also intended to strengthen the ministerial team in the House of Lords. Baroness Denton becomes a junior trade and industry minister, and Baroness Cumberlege a junior health minister. Mr John Redwood, former corporate affairs minister, and Mr David Maclean, who was at the agriculture ministry, become Environment Department ministers of state. Mr Tim Eggar and Mr Richard Needham become the trade and industry ministers. Mr Robert Atkins, the sports minister, becomes a minister of state, Northern Ireland. There was surprise at Westminster that Mrs Currie turned down the opportunity to be a middle-ranking minister. The speculation was that she had been offered a minister of state post at the Home Office. She said she thought someone else could 'do the job far better than I, so I have declined'. Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, was health secretary at the time Mrs Currie resigned as a junior health minister over remarks about British egg production being infected with salmonella. Taking into account the cabinet changes and those ministers who lost their seats, 22 have left the government, though only six of those resigned yesterday.  The Financial Times   London Page 1  "

Speaking after a meeting with Mr John Major, the prime minister, Mr Hume said there would be 'peace within a week' if the initiative was embraced. 'My conclusion is that that is now a real possibility - a total cessation of violence, not a ceasefire,' Mr Hume said. But in a move likely to infuriate Unionists, whom London and Dublin are trying to lure back to the negotiating table, Mr Hume said he intended to brief Mr Adams on his hour-long meeting at Downing Street last night. The session was also attended by Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary. Mr Hume indicated afterwards it would no longer be possible for Sir Patrick to say he did not know details of the Hume-Adams initiative. Mr Major is seeing leaders of the province's four constitutional political parties over the next few days. Yesterday's meeting with Mr Hume was followed by a similar session with Mr John Alderdice of the Alliance party. It emerged yesterday that the Irish government believes it will become clear by early December if there is to be a breakthrough on the London-Dublin peace initiative for Northern Ireland announced by Mr Major and Mr Albert Reynolds, his Irish counterpart, in Brussels last week. Mr Reynolds told the Irish parliament he intended to meet Mr Major again on December 3, before the next meeting of the European Council, to discuss the peace process. Dublin also acted yesterday to clear up ambiguity over the six-point plan set out last week by Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister. One of Mr Spring's points was that Unionist consent would be required for any constitutional change in the north. But Mr Reynolds made it clear yesterday this was not intended as an additional concession. 'I would like to make it very clear that what we are talking about here is the consent of a majority to constitutional change, as precisely defined in Article 1 of the Anglo-Irish agreement,' he told the Irish parliament. 'The government have in no way departed from that position.' In the Commons, Mr John Smith, Labour leader, urged Mr Major to 'take the lead' in efforts to persuade the province's political leaders to return to talks, saying there was an 'inescapable moral obligation' on them to 'co-operate in a new dialogue'. Mr Major, who held cabinet discussions on Northern Ireland yesterday morning, said he intended to take 'a very direct interest' in efforts to bring about a lasting peace, while hinting that an early return to round-table talks was unlikely. 'I don't want to see an artificially staged event where the talks are called together with no probability of them making progress,' he said.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

In 75 minutes of talks in Downing Street -- the first since  they signed their historic Ulster peace declaration two months  ago -- they took stock of developments on their joint initiative  to end the spiral of violence.    Hours before their discussions began they were given a grim  reminder of the continuing terrorism.    A series of firebomb attacks in seven London stores bore all  the hallmarks of the Provisonal IRA, said Scotland Yard.    As they left Downing Street, Mr Major and Mr Reynolds united  in condemning the incidents and recent terrorist attacks in  Northern Ireland    Mr Major said: ""Our response to that is entirely identical.  There is absolutely no justification for those firebombs  overnight any more than there is justification for the killing  of a community police officer in Belfast last week or the other  atrocities that have taken place in Northern Ireland.""    The prime ministers agreed to initiate a new round of  negotiations on the future of Northern Ireland with or without a  response from the IRA and their Sinn Fein allies to the December  15 peace declaration.    Mr Reynolds said officials from the two governments would  agree later today on a date for a meeting of their liaison  committee to advance the next stage of the talks process.    Mr Major insisted: ""There is a route now open for Sinn Fein  to join the constitutional process -- they know what they have  to do. All they have to do is give up violence and then they  will have a proper route to express their views  constitutionally.""    Mr Reynolds again stressed his view that the road to peace  was going to be a long one and that there would be difficulties  along the way.    ""We knew there would always be people on both sides on the  paramilitaries who would be trying to stop our best efforts.    ""But regardless of this violence and destruction that takes  place we will continue along that difficult road, recognising  that people will be trying to frustrate our efforts but that  they will not succeed.""    Today's meeting went ahead before the two prime ministers  join the crowd at Twickenham for the Ireland-England rugby  international. Mr Major referred to the match as he and Mr  Reynolds began a brief news conference outside 10 Downing Street  by saying he had brought along his second row.    ""We are wholly united in our approach to try to find a  solution to the problems of Northern Ireland,"" he added.    ""We regard our joint declaration as a foundation stone for  the future approach of the two governments. We are committed to  it and its lasting value. We see it as a balanced statement of  lasting principles, and it is our view that its value has  already been clearly shown in the way it has been received both  in Ireland and internationally.""    Mr Major said it was impossible for either he or Mr Reynolds  to say whether the IRA would give up its campaign of violence in  the near future.    ""What we are utterly agreed about is that there is no  justification for the continuation of violence by the  Provisionals or by anybody else. What must be fully understood  is that we are not waiting for the Provisionals or anybody else.    ""We have taken further steps in the talks process and we  have  this morning reaffirmed our joint commitment to that process.  No one should be able to veto progress on the talks. We have  made clear what Sinn Fein needs to do to join the process.    ""They are free to come in or they are free to stay out -- if  that is what they choose. But what they can't do is hold up our  determination to continue with the talks process and endeavour  to find a solution.""    The two premiers agreed to maintain the current high level  of  cooperation on security and do all they could to oppose  terrorism.    Mr Major said he believed improved security cooperation was  of immense help in recent years, and that was going to continue.    ""The intention that we both have is peace. We'd like it soon  but however long it takes our determination is to continue a  search for that peace.""     "

The talks, co-ordinated by Mr Michael Ancram, the Northern  Ireland minister, and involving Ulster's four main  constitutional parties, have inevitably fallen out of the  spotlight while it seemed the Downing Street declaration might  persuade the IRA to renounce violence.    But now that the government has concluded that the odds are  against an early end to the 25-year republican campaign --  clearing the way for Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, to  enter the political process -- this order of priorities is about  to change.    This was signalled last week when Mr Ancram began a new  round  of bilateral meetings, seeing a delegation from the largest  party in the province, the Ulster Unionists.    Yesterday he saw senior Alliance party members. Next week he  is due to meet the mainly Roman Catholic Social Democratic and  Labour party [SDLP].    The message to republican leaders is clear. Their hesitancy  over the joint declaration will not be allowed to delay efforts  to piece together a political settlement. After yesterday's  meeting Dr John Alderdice, leader of the Alliance party, added  his voice to those calling for the government not to wait for  Sinn Fein.    Those familiar with the talks say the focus of the  minister's  efforts is to pin down an agenda that would permit participants  to move on from the current time-consuming bilateral format --  disparaged by some as ""blind-date politics"" to round-table  discussions.    It will not be easy. Ministers have said in the past that a  resumption of round-table talks would be counter-productive  until agreement is achievable. An earlier round-table talks  process broke up without success in 1992.    The hardline Democratic Unionist Party has said it will not  return to the talks process, bilateral or otherwise, until the  meetings between Mr John Hume, the SDLP leader, and Mr Gerry  Adams, the Sinn Fein president, end.    Sinn Fein, as might be expected, is scathing about the  exercise's prospects of success. Mr Tom Hartley, the party's  national chairman, says: ""I don't think the dynamic for change  can be found any more in those sorts of talks.""    Mr Ancram is thought to have identified a certain amount of  common ground on structures for devolved government in the  province, including an 85-member Ulster assembly. But less  headway has been made on ""strand two"" of the talks -- how to  handle relations between the province and the Irish Republic.    Ulster Unionists are keen for efforts to be focused on  setting this assembly up. But the SDLP is unlikely to consent  to this without agreement on north/south relations, and on  strand three -- relations between the two governments.    Mr Hume is said to have received assurances last week that  the talks process would continue to embrace all three sets of  relationships. But London is still waiting for a paper setting  out Dublin's ideas on strands two and three which it requested  last September.     "

The CAF - which advises charities on investments and is a leading source of research on the sector - has commissioned a survey of 400 charities, from the largest to local voluntary organisations, in 20 places around the country. Charities will be asked how their income compares with two years ago from: individual donations; legacies; corporate support; income from the sale of goods and services; and local and central government grants and fees. The survey comes when charities are finding demand for their services outstripping income growth. Previous research has shown little real increase in charitable giving in recent years, although many of the biggest charities have managed to expand their income against the general trend. Mr Michael Brophy, executive director of the CAF, said: 'There are indications that the overall decline in income growth is now beginning to affect some of the biggest charities as much as the others. The survey will provide information on the extent of this trend.' As a number of charities prepare to take on additional responsibilities with April's community care reforms, there is growing concern that attempts in the 1980s to encourage substantially greater support for charity appear to have failed. Voluntary-sector leaders have developed plans for a national marketing campaign - modelled on successful precedents in the US and Canada - to promote the general concept of charitable giving. Ministers have, however, decided against helping to finance it and it is unlikely to get off the ground. Mr Jacques Delors, EC president, has assured voluntary organisations in Northern Ireland that they will be consulted on the reform of EC structural funds and other social policy developments. That follows a visit by the EC president to the province late last year. Mr Quintin Oliver, director of the Northern Ireland Council for Voluntary Service, said that by agreeing to formal consultation with voluntary organisations Mr Delors had acknowledged 'that the voluntary sector in disadvantaged areas has a key role to play, especially in Northern Ireland'.

Eleven weeks ago, on Dec 15, Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish  Prime Minister, stood shoulder by shoulder with Mr Major outside  No 10 and said there was now an ""historic opportunity"" for  peace. Mr Major said it ""opened the doors"" to those who  abandoned violence.    But Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Provisional IRA has  so far refused to take up their invitation to ""turn the key in  the lock.""    Initially, Mr Major showed considerable irritation with Sinn  Fein's reluctance to respond. Early in January, he branded its  demand for ""clarification"" as a desperate delaying tactic. The  word in Whitehall was that Sinn Fein would have a month to  accept the document or face a tough security clamp-down. That  deadline -- never publicly acknowledged by the Government --  came and went.    The Americans then tried. President Clinton agreed to waive  the ban on Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, entering the  United States last month, because the powerful Irish-American  lobby persuaded him that Mr Adams would use the visit to back  the declaration. Mr Adams, however, milked the visit for  considerable publicity but carefully avoided giving any  commitments.    Attention switched to Sinn Fein's annual conference in  Dublin  last weekend. It was described as a ""watershed"" -- the defining  moment for the republican movement.    Ministers hinted that failure by the conference's delegates  to support the declaration would be seen as tantamount to  rejection -- a clear signal that the IRA and Sinn Fein were not  prepared to abandon violence. But Sinn Fein, while softening  its criticism of the peace initiative, set further conditions  for a suspension of IRA operations.    There are plenty of pessimists in Whitehall and Westminster  ready to say ""I told you so."" They say that Sinn Fein was never  really interested in peace and has used the process to raise its  profile and secure important concessions, including the lifting  of the broadcasting ban in the Republic and the international  media blitz in New York.    The Government has also had to soften its previous firm  stance on refusing to clarify the declaration. Last week, in  the run-up to the Sinn Fein conference, Sir Patrick Mayhew, the  Northern Ireland Secretary, and Mr Hurd, the Foreign Secretary,  made speeches clearly aimed at clarifying the small print of the  document, reaffirming that the British Government would not seek  to impede the ""exercise of self-determination"" -- North and  South.    Mr Major used an article in the Irish News, Northern  Ireland's leading nationalist newspaper, to spell out how Sinn  Fein could enter political talks.    Yet the 11 weeks since the two Prime Ministers stood outside  No. 10 have seen the most intense period of political activity  in Northern Ireland for years. The optimists in Government  argue that Sinn Fein is being gradually drawn into mainstream  politics and is raising expectations of peace which may make it  difficult for the IRA to return to the previous level of  violence.    As always with Ulster politics, any progress is  infuriatingly  slow -- and there is now an acknowledgement that it could take  months -- even years -- before Sinn Fein and the army council of  the IRA are prepared to back the declaration. Both Downing  Street and the Northern Ireland Office stress that it remains on  the table and will not be withdrawn. Even without a positive  Sinn Fein response the joint declaration remains an important  statement of principles agreed by the British and Irish  Governments. ""There never was any time limit. It did not have  a sell-by sticker,"" said one official.    Some politicians most closely involved with Northern Ireland  believe that that a new phase has opened up.    They argue that if events since Dec 15 are judged against  the  broad sweep of the Irish troubles, rather than from a short-term  perspective, there has been considerable movement. The softer  tone of remarks by some leading Sinn Fein figures at their  Dublin conference reflects the party's limited welcome of what  it says is a less confrontational approach from British  ministers. It said it found recent speeches by Sir Patrick and  Mr Hurd ""intriguing.""    At the weekend, the essentially uncompromising line taken  by Mr Adams, was followed by a succession of less hostile  contributions, most notably from Mr Martin McGuinness,  vice-president, and Mr Mitchel McLaughlin Northern Irish  chairman.    Yet the stumbling blocks seem as solid as ever. While Sinn  Fein says it accepts that Protestants cannot be coerced into a  united Ireland, it has not convincingly explained how this  squares with its continuing demand for a British assurance that  Unionists should have no veto.    Though the Irish government considers it has stuck more  firmly to the letter and spirit of the declaration than Mr  Major, it has shown itself increasingly ready to make gestures  intended to bring Sinn Fein into the peace process.    Mr Reynolds has sought to maintain what he recognises is the  crucial backing of his Fianna Fail party's republican  traditionalists by accommodating Sinn Fein's demand for  clarification in spite of London's contrary stand.    His interpretation of the joint statement, including an  assertion that no one, including Unionists, had a veto on  progress, was particularly welcome to Mr Adams and Mr  McGuinness, who have gleefully exploited differences between the  governments.    Republicans were also triumphant when Mr Reynolds's  government lifted the 20-year ban on broadcasters interviewing  Sinn Fein activists and para-militaries a move condemned by  Unionists as ""grovelling to the gunmen.""    The Taoiseach's [Irish prime minister] comment that the  future of terrorist prisoners would be considered in the  negotiations after a permanent end to violence was also seen as  a distinctly unhelpful concession.    Critics of the Dublin approach point out that the promise of  more stringent security should Sinn Fein and the IRA reject the  initiative sits uneasily with the actions of the Dublin court  that last Friday [26 February] refused to extradite Joseph  Magee, accused of murdering an Army sergeant in Derby.

In the first Marshall case, the Court ruled that Miss Marshall was entitled to rely on the provisions of an EC directive in her action for wrongful dismissal on grounds of sex discrimination against her employers, Southampton and South West Hampshire Area Health Authority. Following the European Court's ruling, the case was remitted to the industrial tribunal to consider the question of compensation. Under UK legislation, the maximum compensation which could be paid at the relevant time was Pounds 6,250. The industrial tribunal assessed Miss Marshall's loss at Pounds 18,405, which included Pounds 7,700 in interest. The area health authority paid the capital sum, but appealed against the tribunal's award of interest. The appeal went to the House of Lords which referred it to the European Court. The case raises several important points, including the obligations of EC states to provide effective judicial protection of individuals' Community rights and what constitutes adequate compensation in such situations. The advocate general's opinion and the Court's ruling are expected next year. C-271/91: Marshall v Southampton and South West Area Health Authority. Frontier workers' rights clarified. The Court has provided further clarification of the position relating to social security benefits paid to individuals who are resident in one member state and work in another. The case concerned a woman who worked in Northern Ireland and resided in the Irish Republic with her husband and four children. She received child benefit in Ireland but then applied for it in Northern Ireland, where benefit levels were higher. The Northern Irish Court of Appeal referred the matter to the European Court. The general rule under EC law is that the laws of the country of employment apply. But where an individual has a family in the state of residence, they are entitled to family benefits provided by that state. This rule does not apply, however, when the family already receives benefits given on the basis of a professional or trade activity carried on in the state of residence by the person entitled to the benefits or by the person to whom they are paid. In this case the husband carried on a trade but he was not the person entitled to the benefits. His wife should therefore have been entitled to benefits in both Ireland and Northern Ireland. The Court ruled that the persons entitled to benefits included persons who had care of the children, which in this case was the husband, so the only benefits available were those from the Irish authorities.

Nestle/Perrier The European Commission's decision on the Nestle/Perrier merger is to be challenged in the Court of First Instance by representatives of the Perrier workforce. They argue that the merger should not have been cleared because it reduced the centres of competition in the bottled water market from three to two. They question the Commission's power to restructure the market through merger approval, and say that it should have prevented the disappearance of the third competitor rather than first allowing it to be destroyed and then requiring it to be recreated. They also say the Commission should have ensured the merger did not infringe 'fundamental social rights recognised by Community law' and claim they were not given a proper opportunity to participate in the proceedings.

0,FT924-9359 ,"FT924-9359 _AN-CKFB9AABFT 921106   FT  06 NOV 92 / Survey of Ireland (1): Past and future state - This week's falling apart of the coalition Government in Dublin is evidence of deeper rifts within Irish society as a result of the pressures to create a modern and outward-looking European state. With an election now looming      By TIM COONE   THE POLITICAL crisis of the past week that has brought about the collapse of Ireland's coalition government, and precipitated a general election, was not entirely unforeseen. Superficial strains have been evident in the coalition for months, but were warning signs that much deeper rifts exist throughout the country's body-politic. As 1993 and the Single European Market approaches, Ireland is living the trauma of a country torn between its past and its future. The traditional redoubts of power and paternalism - church, state and family business patriarchs - have in the past year found themselves under assault as never before, from the media, the courts, outspoken pop stars and disgruntled shareholders. The allure of European unity and its perceived promise of a fast road to affluence has made Europhiles of most of the population: 70 per cent voted in favour of the Maastricht treaty in the June referendum. Although by no means all that emanates from Brussels is viewed as desirable, the widespread wish to create a modern, outward-looking Ireland has meant that, in the process, a few sacred cows are being goaded in the direction of the butchers. At the front of the line is the church's moral authority. 'My father, the Bishop', said a banner headline in a Dublin tabloid last May, above a picture of a pudgy teenager who became an overnight celebrity on both sides of the Atlantic. The prelate in question was Bishop Eamonn Casey, the Bishop of Galway, who admit ted to having fathered a son 17 years ago, after his former lover, an American, decided to go public with her story. It was a salacious shock for Ireland's staunch Catholic society, accustomed to the moral strictures of its clergy on the multiple evils of abortion, divorce, contraception and homosexuality. Recommending that the clergy cast the beams out of their own eyes, Ms Sinead O'Connor, the outspoken, shaven-headed Irish singer, one of the avant garde of rebellious Irish women, last month tore up a photograph of the Pope during a live television performance in the United States, saying: 'Fight the real enemy.' There was public and political outrage over a High Court decision preventing a 14-year-old rape victim from travelling to Britain for an abortion. The ruling, and its overturning by the Supreme Court, forced the government into a public commitment to hold a new referendum on the abortion issue. If liberal European social and moral standards are weakening the Catholic church's traditional sway over Irish souls, so are traditional Irish political and business ethics being called into question. In the past four months serving and former prime ministers, and members of their cabinets, have been called to give evidence in the Beef Tribunal, a parliamentary inquiry into allegations of fraud, malpractice and political favouritism in the beef industry. The tribunal has given some insights into the inner workings of Irish government and its civil service. The public has heard of cabinet meetings at which no minutes were kept; no civil servants were present; ministers ignoring expert advice from their own departments; official documents altered or suppressed to avoid the cancellation of lucrative beef export contracts. In the event, the tribunal has been the stage upon which the death throes of the present administration have been acted out. Mr Albert Reynolds, the present prime minister, when called to the witness box ten days ago, accused his industry minister - and leader of the junior coalition party, the Progressive Democrats - Mr Des O'Malley of having been 'dishonest' in his criticisms of Mr Reynolds, when he gave evidence to the inquiry last June. That precipitated the present political crisis. Mr. Reynolds was the minister for industry and commerce during the period which relates to many of the allegations and Mr O'Malley had accused him of 'gross errors of judgment' in supporting beef exports to Iraq in 1987 and 1988. The die was thus cast for a collapse of the coalition. The results of public inquiries into two other scandals - alleged insider dealing by top executives in two state-run companies - are also expected in the coming months. Mr John Bruton, the leader of Fine Gael, the main opposition party, says: 'I think the tribunal will have a cathartic effect and will clean up Irish politics definitively. Corruption or the suspicion of corruption is most corrosive to any economy. Regardless of any findings, it will have had a very good effect in improving the probity of public life. It will have chastened politicians and civil servants such that they will in future be very wary of doing anything untoward.' The various inquiries have also added impetus to the pressure for changes in corporate management. The accountancy profession is about to introduce new guidelines and standards to close loopholes which have been exploited in the past by unscrupulous businessmen. Institutional fund managers and stock exchange officials have raised their voices in recent weeks to call for a greater onus of responsibility to be placed on non-executive directors. The image of Irish business practice has not been helped by the succession of scandals; nor has the image of Ireland itself been aided by the continuing trouble in Northern Ireland. Peace talks, in meetings involving the British and Irish governments and the four main constitutional parties in Northern Ireland, have been going on since last April in an effort to find a solution to the 70-year-old conflict. The talks are on the verge of collapse because of the rival and incompatible constitutional claims to the province. The Unionists from Northern Ireland want the Republic to hold a referendum which would abolish or amend Articles II and III of the Irish constitution, the basis of the Republic's territorial claim on the North. The Unionists have threatened to walk out of the talks if there is no commitment by the Irish government to a referendum by the date set for the next Anglo-Irish Conference meeting - just ten days away, on November 16. Opposition parties in the Republic have called on the government to show flexibility in order not to lose what is, they say, an historic opportunity for peace. The talks are expected to wind up today with perhaps nothing more than a vague promise to return to the negotiating table some time in the New Year. Two referendums the government has committed itself to are those on abortion and divorce. Later this month voters will be asked whether they want constitutional changes to permit limited abortion in Ireland in cases of a life-threatening, as opposed to a health-threatening, risk to the mother. The convoluted wording of the referendum text, designed to appease both anti-abortion and pro-choice lobbies and aimed at winning a cross-party consensus, has failed to achieve any of these objectives. Even the erstwhile junior partners in Ireland's coalition government, the Progressive Democrats have expressed deep reservations. Womens' health should not be discriminated against, opponents of the wording say. The government argues that if a distinction is not made it will open to the door to abortion on demand. The planned divorce referendum has now been pre-empted by the general election and is unlikely to be held before the second half of next year. But the potent brew of abortion, Northern Ireland, the Beef Tribunal and deepening concerns over the government's ability to maintain its foreign exchange policy - and hence its economic policy - will provide plenty of ammunition for what is likely to be one of the most bitter election campaigns for some time. Mr Bruton, the Fine Gael leader, recently reorganised his shadow cabinet in preparation for such an eventuality. He said: 'We have had to work on the assumption that we needed to be ready for an election at any time.' Whether Fine Gael could do better remains to be seen, but for the sake of change the electorate might be willing to give it a try. If traditional values are coming under heavy fire there is no reason to assume that traditional party loyalties should remain sacrosanct.  The Financial Times   London Page 33  "

Among Northern Ireland politicians, nationalists greeted the ceasefire announcement with delight while unionists voiced suspicion that the statement did not signal a permanent end to the IRA's terrorist campaign. Sir George Gardiner, chairman of the 92 group of Thatcherite Tory MPs, warned of the risk of 'igniting opinion in the majority of Northern Ireland' if ministers moved too fast in response to the IRA ceasefire. Mr Andrew Hunter, a member of the Commons Northern Ireland committee, feared it could be 'a tactical ploy - a pause in the killing'. He said: 'You cannot possibly sit at a table and negotiate with people who will resume killing if they don't get what they want in those negotiations - that is an impossible situation.' An indication of the potential Tory opposition to constitutional talks with Sinn Fein came with the publication of a pamphlet by Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, who argued against involving Sinn Fein in talks. The pamphlet, written before yesterday's announcement, said Sinn Fein's participation in a constitutional conference would put ministers 'in the position of being held responsible for the next round of terror if they do not give in to the IRA blackmail of threatening to pull out'. On the left of the Tory party Mr Peter Temple-Morris said people were 'afraid of peace'. Another Tory backbencher urged unionists to 'seize the opportunities of peace' and break the 'hatred of the past'. Mr Tony Blair, Labour leader, gave a cautious welcome to the IRA ceasefire, but stressed the test would come in whether it led to a permanent renunciation of violence. Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, said: 'If the IRA has at last realised that it cannot achieve its aims through violence, then this is a very important moment for peace in Northern Ireland.' In Northern Ireland, unionist politicians said the IRA should surrender its arsenal of weapons and explosives to prove it was serious about ending terrorism for good. But Mr John Hume, leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party, who put his reputation on the line by talking with Sinn Fein, said the ceasefire would be 'welcomed by Irish people everywhere, but particularly by the people in the streets of Northern Ireland. Now we face the primary challenge which is to reach agreement among our divided people.' The Rev William McCrea, an MP from the hardline Democratic Unionist party, said the IRA was not seeking peace but trying to blackmail the government for more concessions. Dr John Alderdice, leader of the moderate Alliance party, commented that actions would speak louder than words. Mr Terry Carlin, regional officer of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, called on 'all paramilitary organisations to halt the violence. There's a lot of work to be done in healing the wounds and the mental and physical scars of social deprivation.' A number of broadcasters, led by Mr John Birt, the BBC director-general, last night called on the government to reconsider broadcasting restrictions on Sinn Fein members in view of the ceasefire.

But after a fresh round of talks between Mr John Major and Mr Albert Reynolds, the two leaders were forced to acknowledge there were several remaining obstacles to an agreement which would usher in a new era in Anglo-Irish relations. Despite these difficulties, the two leaders hope to meet again in London before Christmas to pursue an agreement. During talks at the European Union meeting in Brussels, the British and Irish prime ministers agreed the statement should act as a springboard for an intensive round of negotiations on a permanent political settlement in Northern Ireland. More immediately they hope it will coax the IRA, through its political wing Sinn Fein, into extending its traditional Christmas ceasefire into a permanent cessation of violence. Officials on both sides, however, admitted the two governments had yet to find the precise language for the most sensitive passages in the document. They also remained uncertain that the first attempt since the 1985 Anglo-Irish agreement to balance the competing claims of Irish nationalism and Ulster unionism could restore peace. After an hour-long meeting the two leaders issued a brief joint statement saying they had made further progress towards agreement on the text of the declaration. They would meet again before Christmas to bring the process to a conclusion. With Mr Major anxious to secure an accord before parliament breaks on Friday for the Christmas recess, one high-ranking British official commented: 'I very much hope we get there. I cannot guarantee that we will get there.' He then added: 'There is still some way to go.' The two governments will attempt to iron out the remaining differences during intensive contacts over the next few days, opening the possibility of a final summit meeting in London on Tuesday or Wednesday. Anxious to reassure the Ulster Unionists, British officials said the declaration would underwrite its guarantee to the Unionist majority in Northern Ireland that there could be no change in the status of the province without their consent. Mr Major had also won assurances from Mr Reynolds of the Irish government's commitment to drop its constitutional claim to Northern Ireland as part of a comprehensive political settlement. The joint declaration will repeat the offer to Sinn Fein of a place at the negotiating table in response to a total cessation of terrorist activities. There were signs, however, of continuing disagreement over Dublin's demand for an all-Ireland convention open to all constitutional parties from the North and South.

Although historic exploratory talks between the UK government and Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, were seen as constructive, sharp differences emerged over the timing of the disposal of IRA arms and explosives. After the first public talks between UK officials and Sinn Fein in 25 years of troubles, the two sides appeared on a collision course. The government insisted that the decommissioning of the IRA's arsenal would be a condition to Sinn Fein being allowed to enter all-party talks on the future of Ulster. Mr Michael Ancram, the Northern Ireland political affairs minister, said after a briefing by Mr Quentin Thomas, head of the UK's five-man delegation, that 'their continued retention will constitute a barrier to other political parties, as well as to the government itself, in joining with Sinn Fein in substantive political negotiations'. The minister warned that if the talks are 'to be taken to a successful conclusion, then the question of the decommissioning of arms must be resolved to satisfaction'. Nevertheless, he called the meeting 'constructive and business-like' while Mr Martin McGuinness, leading the five-strong Sinn Fein delegation, said it was 'a good beginning'. Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, however, warned the government that it should not place conditions on the talks process. 'History will judge the British badly if they make excuses for not moving the peace process forward,' he said. The exploratory meeting at the former Northern Ireland parliament building at Stormont Castle in Belfast came exactly 100 days after the announcement of the IRA ceasefire. Condemned by hardline unionists, the meeting is viewed as an important part of wider negotiations started by the British and Irish governments, which aim to bring all the political parties in Ulster into discussions to craft a constitutional framework for the province. Mr John Major, who received a report on the meeting at the European Union summit in Essen, told other EU leaders that contacts with the republicans were designed to turn a 'ceasefire into a lasting peace'. He underlined that London and Dublin were close to a framework agreement to provide the basis for round-table talks on a new political settlement. Mr Ancram said yesterday's discussion had raised a 'very large areas of subjects'. Both sides had 'a good trot around the course', he said. Mr McGuinness, said the talks 'should have happened a long time ago'. The two sides agreed to meet again on December 19. Meanwhile, the Ulster Democratic party, one of the loyalist groups invited to talks next week with UK officials, warned it was reconsidering the invitation because of the presence at the Stormont meeting of a councillor from the Irish Republic. Sinn Fein delegates, who included the Old Bailey bomber Mr Gerry Kelly, called for an end to British military operations and a speedy release of all political prisoners. Sinn Fein said these issues should be addressed as a matter of urgency. Sinn Fein comes in from the cold, Page 6 New tune for Irish reel, Page 9   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

The plan, sent to London last month, provided for the Dublin government to drop its constitutional claim to the north and to recognise that Irish unification could come only with the consent of a majority in Ulster. As a quid pro quo, the British side would have to agree to a document endorsing the value of eventual Irish unity and to early and simultaneous referendums in the republic and the north to provide a visible expression of 'self-determination'. Mr Reynolds wanted the plan to provide the basis of the communique after today's talks. The two leaders agreed to downgrade the status of the summit after acrimonious exchanges earlier in the week threatened at one stage to result in its cancellation. Dublin now refers to it as a 'working meeting' rather than a summit. It is understood that Mr Major was ready to accept a document framework that included explicit recognition of the legitimacy of the aspirations of Irish nationalists. But he rejected as unacceptable to moderate unionists the idea that Britain should tacitly support the goal of Irish unity by signing up to a statement proclaiming its 'value'. Mr Major also judged that the proposal for joint referendums on 'self-determination' would dilute his government's commitment to the Unionists' veto on constitutional change. Both sides were last night attempting to play down the rift. In London, it was suggested a short statement to be released after the talks would emphasise the two leaders' commitment to seek an agreement. Irish officials pointed out that by agreeing to a total of three working meetings during December there was still room for manoeuvre and hope for progress. Mr Major, anxious to reassure Mr James Molyneaux's Ulster Unionist party after the disclosure of the government's clandestine contacts with Sinn Fein, told MPs: 'There is for us one fundamental point: Northern Ireland's status as part of the United Kingdom will not change without the freely expressed consent of the people of northern Ireland.' Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, in a thinly- veiled reference to Mr Reynolds' plan, also rejected the idea the government could recognise the goal as well as the aspiration of Irish unity.

0,FT941-13762 ,"FT941-13762 _AN-EAXCSACWFT 940124   FT  24 JAN 94 / Leading Article: Anglo-Irish co-operation   The Anglo-Irish strategy for bringing peace to Northern Ireland has not yet brought about a ceasefire, but that is no reason to abandon it. Launched shortly before Christmas over the signatures of both Mr John Major, the British prime minister, and Mr Albert Reynolds, his Irish counterpart, its great strength is that it is a joint enterprise. This confers a political advantage that the terrorists cannot match. It puts London and Dublin unequivocally on the same side in promoting the use of the democratic process as the sole legitimate means of solving the problem of two communities living together on one island. In contrast the perpetrators of violence appear to be divided. The Irish Republican Army is evidently unwilling to stop its murderous campaign. Perhaps it is unable to do so, for fear of provoking self-destructive in-fighting. Mr Gerry Adams, the president of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, speaks of an opportunity for peace, but has not shown himself capable of delivering a ceasefire. Instead he has ducked and weaved, talking of time for consideration, asking for clarification, trying to shift the blame for the violence to the British - in short, playing for time and appealing to a wide range of public opinion. 'Unionist veto' Mr Adams' argument, and in particular his insistent objection to what he calls the 'Unionist veto' over any future pan-Irish settlement, was demolished by Mr Reynolds on Thursday night. In an important speech, the Taoiseach recalled the UN charter, the Helsinki Final Act, the UN declaration on principles of international law (1960) and even South Korea's acknowledgement that reunification with North Korea should not be sought by violent means. All these authorities, plus Irish history, were invoked in support of the contention that 'the people of Northern Ireland have the right to determine by a majority whether they wish to stay with Britain or join a sovereign united or agreed Ireland'. The Irish prime minister noted that his joint declaration with Mr Major also recognised the right of self-determination of the nationalist - that is, Catholic - community in the north. But a united Ireland could not be achieved by either political or military force, only by persuasion. 'Accordingly, there is not merely no moral justification, but also no coherent ideological basis for a continuation of armed struggle,' he said. IRA isolated Given time, the persistent demonstration that the IRA cannot justify its attacks, even to most people in its own natural constituency, will isolate it, both within these troubled islands and internationally. The speech by the Northern Ireland Secretary, Sir Patrick Mayhew, on Thursday night pursued a similar objective. Rejecting negotiations with Sinn Fein while violence continued, Sir Patrick offered 'clarification' of how the nationalist party could be brought into the political process, once the use of arms was renounced. He thus showed that Britain might be flexible, without abandoning the principle that a ceasefire must precede serious talks. Mr Major's weekend reply to a letter from Mr Adams was in the same vein. This sensible strategy, and the entire Anglo-Irish concordance, would be enhanced by a removal of the ban on the use of Sinn Fein voices on British radio and TV, following the lifting of more draconian restrictions by Dublin. No-one can expect with confidence that this approach will end IRA attacks. The UK government should nevertheless proceed with talks on new constitutional arrangements for Ulster, while taking care to keep Dublin on side at every step. It is well placed to ask for Mr Reynolds' wholehearted support for and co-operation with security responses to whatever level of violence occurs. The Irish government has at last published a bill that would close legal loopholes in extradition procedures. It can no longer plausibly defend the possession of certain explosives and weapons as political offences to which extradition would not apply. Likewise, if further security measures, even draconian ones such as internment, have to be considered, Britain and Ireland should act in unison. Whatever Mr Adams does next, the alliance of purpose between London and Dublin is the most powerful enemy he has faced.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

One cannot but think that if a political solution to the problems besetting the country could be found, great improvements would be made. At a time when both South Africa and Israel have thought the unthinkable and negotiated with their enemies and brought political solutions in sight, should not our government similarly buckle down to finding a political solution in Northern Ireland? Perhaps the foreign secretary could devote more of his efforts to this very worthwhile end.

Like a ghost  without a face and without a voice, who, from one of his 25 safe  houses in Belfast or his bomb-proof office on Falls Road, would  terrorize Britain with the mere mention of his name, which was  synonymous with fear, bombings, and mysteries.    Now Gerry Adams has come out of the shadows. The charismatic  leader of Sinn Fein (the Northern Irish party that is in  practice the political wing of the IRA), the man who has  survived dozens of attacks by Protestant Unionists and the  innumerable diplomatic traps of the oldest conflict in Europe,  has started showing his beard and his open smile around the  world. Like a real statesman.    First America, last week the Basque Country. Yesterday, he  arrived in Italy, where he will visit Venice, then Turin, for  the presentation of his book -- surprisingly, a narrative work.  It is called, ""The Road and Other Stories."" It is all set in  the poor and desperate streets of West Belfast, the Catholic  ghetto of the Northern Irish capital, where Adams was born and  where the guerrilla warfare is fiercest.    ""To describe it as a diplomatic offensive is perhaps going  too far,"" he said dismissively, persuasive, and polite. ""But  when the American Government granted me a visa, I accepted  invitations from organizations and friends. The visit was a  great success for Sinn Fein and for the cause of the Republican  movement. I was invited to visit the Basque Country a year ago,  and at last I accepted. I visited Italy in 1987 and I pledged  to return if ever one of my books were to be translated. Of  course, this has all happened at a rather busy time for the  negotiations on Northern Ireland, but I could not refuse.""    [Orizio] On 15 December 1993, there was the historic London  and Dublin agreement on ""the Northern Ireland people's right to  self-determination."" Sinn Fein asked for clarifications on 20  points. First, London said ""no,"" then it changed its mind.  Yesterday evening you received a partial reply: a ""yes"" to a  referendum in Ulster. Is this a victory? Does British Prime  Minister John Major accept you as interlocutors now?    [Adams] Yes, of course. But relations between Sinn Fein and  the British Government began in secret three years ago and have  never ceased. If there were not the Maastricht Treaty to  approve in Westminster, and therefore if a John Major with  problems had not needed to keep his Unionist votes safe, he  would have officially recognized us as a partner in the dialogue  much sooner. So yesterday's acknowledgement is nothing new.    [Orizio] But now Major is talking openly about a referendum,  to determine the future of Northern Ireland. This is something  new.    [Adams] Before making an assessment of the substance of the  British document, we will have to analyze its 21 pages  thoroughly. Permit me to say, however, that a 21-page reply to  just one of the points that we raised shows that we were right  to want to look into the matter more thoroughly and that we were  in good faith. Of course, we are clear about how the ""right to  self-determination"" would express itself, but we believe that  the entire people of Ireland, and not just of Northern Ireland,  are entitled to express themselves. Be that as it may, if this  British reply helps the dialogue to continue, it really is  welcome.    [Orizio] Are Major's domestic political problems influencing  the negotiations?    [Adams] Yes, and in a very negative way. Major's position is  so precarious that the prime minister is effectively being held  hostage by a group of members of parliament of the Tory Right,  who are holding him for ransom precisely over the Northern  Ireland issue. Without this problem, the negotiations would be  much further advanced.    [Orizio] But there is again more shooting going on in Ulster  than before. Why?    [Adams] It is the Protestant terrorists that are responsible  for almost all these bloodthirsty incidents. The other day they  killed two Catholic workers, 10 days ago an old lady who was  watching television. They are trying to frighten people. But  the worst thing is that they shoot with weapons supplied by the  British Government, as we have proved with documentary evidence.  These weapons came via South Africa and were brought in by a  British agent.    [Orizio] The British Government, however, accuses you  Republicans of having taken weapons from Iran, in exchange for  the elimination of political adversaries of the Ayatollah.    [Adams] It also accuses us of managing a drugs racket to  finance the struggle. It is all lies. Ridiculous stories.  Tehran has denied it, the IRA has denied it, and the Dublin  government has denied it. The fact is that it is all British  propaganda. After the support gathered during my visit to  America, London decided to respond by trying to discredit us.  But no one in Belfast believes these things.    [Orizio] Leaving these accusations aside, is there a hope of  peace now?    [Adams] I believe so. People want peace and the  international climate is favorable. Dialogue has resolved two  crises that seemed insoluble -- the Middle East and South  Africa. Now it is up to us. The political process of dialogue  must be started. We republicans believe in it.

Mr Reynolds' meeting with Mr Adams marked the re-emergence of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, as a mainstream party for the first time since the Irish civil war in the 1920s. The meeting was attended by Mr John Hume, head of the mainly nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party, and in a statement the three leaders said: 'We are at the beginning of a new era in which we are all totally and absolutely committed to democratic and peaceful methods of resolving our political problems.' The meeting was condemned by rightwing Conservative MPs and Unionist leaders, who claimed that Dublin had broken an agreement not to meet Sinn Fein leaders for three months after a permanent ceasefire. However, Mr Major refused to listen to protests from Mr Paisley, the most popular Unionist politician in Northern Ireland, during a meeting at Downing Street. As Mr Paisley attempted to read a prepared statement, Mr Major three times demanded an assurance that the DUP leader would accept his word that no secret deals had been done. When Mr Paisley refused to give such an assurance, Mr Major abruptly ended the meeting. The confrontation followed a meeting of senior British ministers, chaired by Mr Major, which agreed that the government would continue to demand guarantees of a permanent IRA ceasefire before entering talks with Sinn Fein. The government's approach was broadly endorsed by Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader, and Lord Holme, the Liberal Democrat spokesman on Northern Ireland, marking a cross-party rejection of the Irish government's desire for fast progress towards all-party talks. Mr Blair said the government was 'right to be cautious and not to engage in direct negotiations until a proper period has passed so that we can gauge whether the cessation of violence is indeed permanent'. British officials said Mr Reynolds' meeting with Sinn Fein was 'premature'. However, they said the meeting would not interfere with progress towards a framework agreement on the next stage of the Northern Ireland peace process, which the two governments hope to produce before Christmas. The continued caution in London contrasted sharply with the optimistic tone of the Dublin statement, in which the three nationalist leaders said their objective was to build upon the IRA ceasefire announcement last week to achieve 'an equitable and lasting agreement' for Ireland's future. They appealed to Unionists in Northern Ireland to join in talks. Mr Reynolds said Mr Major wanted an assurance 'that it is for real; that it is over'. He said: 'I hope that our statement here today, representing the sense of the meeting, will indeed help him along that road.' He challenged his critics, saying: 'To those people who say 'Why so soon?' my answer has to be - it is never too soon to save a life, and never too soon to stop the killing.' Unionist leaders reacted angrily. Mr David Trimble, Ulster Unionist MP for Upper Bann, said he was 'astonished' the Dublin meeting had taken place. 'Mr Adams has at his back a private army still with thousands of weapons, still with tons of munitions at his disposal,' he said. 'For an Irish prime minister to meet with the leader of a subversive organisation who has got his private army intact is really quite astounding.' Mr Andrew Hunter, chairman of the Conservative backbench Northern Ireland committee, said the meeting was 'a disastrous miscalculation by the Irish government, and potentially it has most damaging consequences'. He said there was 'grave concern that the Irish government is scuppering the process by bending over backwards to appease the IRA'. In Belfast yesterday Republican sources indicated that the IRA had no intention in the medium term of being more specific about the meaning of its ceasefire. 'We have entered an unarmed stage of our struggle for self-determination for the Irish people,' a Republican source said.

0,FT942-12561 ,"FT942-12561 _AN-ED2DAAAZFT 940429   FT  29 APR 94 / Intelligence points to IRA-Iran drug connection      By JIMMY BURNS, DAVID OWEN and PAUL ABRAHAMS   The IRA has been drawing on financial support from Iran, possibly linked to drugs transactions, and may have been on the verge of securing a large arms shipment. This information, gathered by intelligence agencies, including Britain's MI6, appears to be behind the decision by the Foreign Office yesterday to warn the Tehran government to desist from further contacts with the Irish terrorist organisation. British officials insist they had no alternative to taking yesterday's high profile action because of the firm nature of the information gathered. Although some money is believed to have been exchanged between Iran and the Irish Republican Army, the action was largely pre-emptive and designed to stop the links from strengthening. UK intelligence has been monitoring political links between the IRA and Tehran since the early 1980s. Recently the suspicion has grown that the IRA may have been aiming to secure financial and military support from Tehran as an alternative to Libya, which has been a main supplier of weapons and explosives. The tilt towards Tehran follows intense efforts by the FBI and UK security forces to stop funding and logistical support from the US, and a crackdown on racketeering in Northern Ireland linked to the IRA. Yesterday's announcement follows the recent arrest in Greece of two German subjects allegedly linked to a drugs operation involving the IRA and the Middle East. The latest disclosure comes at a particularly sensitive time in Northern Ireland, with violence again on the increase and the main political parties in the province - including the IRA's political wing Sinn Fein - gearing up for the European election. This will inevitably be seen in Northern Ireland as a referendum on the Anglo-Irish peace initiative. According to observers, there would be few more effective ways of undermining support for Sinn Fein in advance of this crucial poll than by linking the IRA to drug trafficking. Republican leaders have traditionally been careful to disassociate themselves from drug-related crime and have frequently resorted to gun law to punish alleged traffickers. Earlier this week the IRA killed one alleged dealer and injured 16 others in an offensive whose timing was felt by observers to have been heavily influenced by the election.

Concerns spread far beyond the national broadsheet newspapers to provincial dailies and caused particular tremors in the Irish Republic, where newspapers are both expensive to produce and burdened with value added tax. 'This makes me feel very ill,' said one newspaper industry specialist after feeding the numbers into a matrix of revenue and circulation. 'Millions and millions will be lost.' There was growing concern that the cost-cutting process would break down loyalty to particular titles. First indications were that The Independent, at 20p for a single day yesterday, increased sales by 15 per cent to 16 per cent. The Daily Telegraph at 30p claimed a rise of more than 25 per cent, although some wholesalers put it closer to 12 per cent. The Times said last night it had lost only 2 per cent to 3 per cent. The middle-market papers, the Daily Mail, Daily Express and Today, are believed to have lost 4 per cent to 6 per cent. It was not clear whether any other national newspaper planned to join the price war, although there is growing speculation that The Independent may go to 40p. The Guardian, whose circulation rose last month, will be extremely cautious about any price cutting. Mr David Bell, chief executive of the Financial Times - at 65p the most expensive national daily - said: 'The Financial Times is priced according to what it costs to produce. We think that is in the best long-term interests of both the paper and its readers.' Lord Rothermere, chairman of Associated Newspapers, publisher of the Daily Mail, is understood to be reviewing the situation and a cut in the price of the mid-market papers should not be ruled out. The Daily Mail has been selling at 20p in Northern Ireland and is understood to have achieved a 24 per cent sales increase.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P2711 Newspapers.

0,FT944-8281 ,"FT944-8281 _AN-EKUDAACVFT 941121   FT  21 NOV 94 / Leading Article: No bad thing for Ireland   The outside world in general, and Britain and Northern Ireland in particular, have been watching with some confusion and alarm as the Irish government pulled itself apart over the past week. Just as the peace process in Ireland offers a real chance of relief for the bombed and battered population of the north, the coalition in Dublin appears to have collapsed over what outsiders might regard as a domestic squabble. It would be wrong, however, to dismiss the issues involved in the disintegration of the Irish government, and the resignation of Mr Albert Reynolds as prime minister and leader of Fianna Fail, the largest party, as irrelevant to the peace process and the future of Ireland. Far from it. The confrontation between Mr Dick Spring and his Labour party, on the one hand, and Mr Reynolds' party on the other, has exposed some vital questions about the democratic process in the Irish republic. The first is whether the country can claim to be a genuinely secular state while the Roman Catholic church continues to wield a pervasive influence in political life, a subject of enormous concern to the northern Irish protestant population. The second is the tradition of making blatantly political appointments to the Irish judiciary. The third is the question of accountability of politicians for their words and actions, an important component in an open and flourishing democracy. On all of these concerns, the Irish republic would appear to have emerged strengthened as a democratic state from the events of the past week. The confrontation in the coalition blew up over the insistence of Mr Reynolds on nominating his friend and attorney-general, Mr Harry Whelehan, as the next president of the High Court, the second highest judicial office in the land. Mr Whelehan was already a highly controversial figure for his role in seeking to prevent a 14-year-old rape victim from travelling to Britain for an abortion. His obvious reluctance to extradite a self-confessed paedophile priest to face charges in Northern Ireland compounded the impression that he was unduly influenced by the most conservative elements in the Catholic church. The fact that both have now been forced to resign - and that their resignation has been welcomed by the Irish population - suggests that the trend towards a more secular state is growing, as is the pressure for clean government. Both misled their cabinet colleagues and parliament, and both have been held accountable. Mr Spring now faces a tough decision whether to reform the coalition with Fianna Fail under its new leader, Mr Bertie Ahern. On balance, he would appear wise to do so, at least to bring minimum disruption to the peace process. Mr Ahern has a good record as a successful negotiator and broker of tough compromises as a trade union leader, and labour minister. Mr Spring has proved some important points. Now the most crucial thing is to keep the peace process on track.   Countries:-  IEZ  Ireland, EC.   Industries:-  P9199 General Government, NEC.     P8651 Political Organizations.

With Mr John Major, the prime minister, preparing to meet unionist leaders at Downing Street next week, Mr Hurd also offered an assurance that the troubles were at the top of the government's agenda. Mr Hurd was speaking after Mr James Molyneaux, the Ulster Unionist party leader, had given a surprisingly upbeat assessment of the prospects for success of the Major-Reynolds peace initiative. In an implicit rebuke to the Rev Ian Paisley, the hardline Democratic Unionist party, leader, Mr Hurd praised Mr Molyneaux and Mr John Hume, leader of the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party, for taking some risks for peace. 'They and others will need to take more,' he said. It emerged earlier this week that ministers were prepared to press ahead with the peace process without DUP participation if necessary. Mr Major and Mr Paisley are expected to meet on Monday or Tuesday. In remarks delivered less than 24 hours after Mr Hume claimed there would be 'peace within a week' if his initiative with Sinn Fein president Mr Gerry Adams was embraced, Mr Hurd - a former Northern Ireland secretary - said he did not agree that a political settlement could do nothing to stop terrorism. He praised the six-point plan recently put forward by Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, as 'constructive'. Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, is expected to discuss the peace process further during his speech to the Fianna Fail party conference this weekend. Unionist MPs yesterday rejected Mr Hume's 'peace within a week' claim as 'preposterous'. Mr Ken Maginnis, UUP security spokesman, said Mr Hume's contention was 'just about as arrogant as it is ludicrous'. Mr Molyneaux claimed he had seen an early draft of the peace plan, and said: 'It is a fiendish plan which would suppress the wishes of the greater number of people in Northern Ireland. They represent a total surrender to all of the demands made by the IRA.' Mr Paisley yesterday urged Mr Hume to 'stop this dialogue-of-death process with the republican movement'.

A strategy document, Towards a Lasting Peace in Ireland, will be discussed at Sinn Fein's annual congress in Dublin this weekend. The document argues that the political and economic changes in eastern and western Europe 'demand an equivalent breadth of vision and willingness to innovate. The partition of Ireland and the British claim to jurisdiction over the Six Counties (Northern Ireland) is a European issue'. It argues that the UN can help to bring about abolition of emergency laws and special courts in Northern Ireland and the republic and participate in setting up talks. The document says: 'As an interim measure Sinn Fein would propose that the UN secretary-general requests annual reports from the British government on its role in Ireland and conducts a yearly review of the consequences of the continued partition.' It envisages an international conference on the conflict which would 'involve representatives of all political views in Ireland, along with international experts on decolonisation and conflict resolution'. The British and Irish governments have rejected the inclusion of Sinn Fein in political discussions on Northern Ireland, until it formally distances itself from the IRA and renounces the use of force. Neither government would comment yesterday on the proposals but could be expected to block any attempt to involve the EC or the UN, arguing that it was an internal matter. Sinn Fein's weekend congress will discuss a range of social and economic issues, including a women's policy document which includes motions on the right of divorce and abortion in the republic. The congress is not expected to produce serious divisions over moves to distance Sinn Fein more clearly from the IRA. In a recent interview with the Irish Times Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, said the IRA 'does come from the same tradition as Sinn Fein. We do share common objectives, but the IRA reaches its decisions independently of Sinn Fein, and Sinn Fein reaches its decisions independently of the IRA'.  The Financial Times   London Page 4  "

By TIM COONE   CAN an overture for peace in Northern Ireland which has been welcomed by the IRA be taken seriously? The welcome comes from people who have pushed home their political message, not just through megaphones in street rallies, or through hunger strikes in prison, but with the car bomb and the silenced pistol shot in the night. That is the question that will face Mr John Major, the prime minister, next week when he hears from the Irish government the details of the recent peace initiative created by Mr John Hume of the Social Democratic and Labour party, and Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Provisional IRA. The two nationalist leaders from the province say that, after six months of bilateral discussions, they are 'convinced that a process can be designed to lead to agreement among the divided people of this island, which will provide a solid basis for peace'. With the Treasury pressing hard for deep defence cuts, the IRA believes the temptation for Mr Major must be at least to explore what may be offered. At the same time, however, Mr Major's precarious Westminster majority and the threat of further backbench revolts has increased his dependence on the support of the Ulster Unionist party, led by Mr James Molyneaux. Mr Molyneaux, who sees treachery and betrayal of the Union behind the Hume-Adams initiative, thus has a powerful weapon with which to attack it. And attack it he has, saying last week in no uncertain terms: 'We reject Hume-Adams. It is sheer lunacy.' So what is there for Mr Major to chew on in this initiative, and what makes it different from the many failed peace initiatives of the past two decades? First, it is not coming solely from Mr Adams. It is co-authored by Mr John Hume, a widely respected lifelong opponent of using violence for political ends. His political inspiration is drawn from figures such as Martin Luther King and Mahatma Gandhi rather than such traditional republican heroes as Wolfe Tone or James Connolly. Second, the initiative has the blessing of the Irish government, which has as much interest as the British government in seeing a peaceful settlement of the conflict in Northern Ireland. Mr Hume and Mr Adams have agreed to keep details of the initiative secret until both governments have had time to evaluate it. But recent interviews with both men allow the following outline to be pieced together: The initiative envisages a three-stage process, beginning with the search for a mechanism to bring about a cessation of hostilities. It would then progress through a protracted period of all-inclusive negotiations on the future constitutional status of Northern Ireland and culminate in a simultaneous referendum north and south of the border on any proposed changes. Mr Hume and Mr Adams do not have any blueprint for a future constitutional settlement, but are united in believing that Unionists should not be allowed to block the British government's own efforts to achieve political progress and dialogue. Mr Hume and Mr Adams would accept the outcome of a referendum, even if a majority in Northern Ireland were to reject a solution which would favour a nationalist perspective. In relation to the last point, Mr Hume said a simultaneous referendum both north and south of the border 'would require a Yes from each. If either says No, it's not on. How much further can I go to reassure Unionists? I have not even suggested what a final agreement should look like, nor has Gerry Adams,' he said. On that same point, Mr Adams said: 'I and Sinn Fein want to see an Irish national democracy but what form that takes is for the Irish people to decide.' He said that were Sinn Fein's goal of a united Ireland to be rejected in a referendum, even just by a northern majority 'we would continue to seek a Republican model but through the normal political process'. Mr Adams was not prepared at this stage to reveal what might be the minimum terms the IRA would find acceptable to lay down their guns. But he told the Financial Times that he would like to see the IRA 'in permanent retirement' and that the Republican movement was prepared to make concessions to end the violence. He said: 'We are trying to take the armed element out of the conflict, all aspects of it and not just the IRA. British forces are one element and the loyalist paramilitaries are another. 'We are trying to put together a political process, such that those presently involved in the military side of the struggle can become involved in a political process, putting aside the military aspect. 'I would like to see the IRA in permanent retirement. The Unionists have no monopoly in wanting peace.' He continued: 'John Hume and I do not profess to have all the answers. Others also have to grasp the nettle as well, and we may have to make it easier for them to do so. If our proposals are not good enough, then let's hear why and see if people at this end can accommodate them. 'Everything is possible if the British government has the political will to move this process forward.' The Northern Ireland Office (NIO) has responded with predictable caution to Mr Adams remarks. It said yesterday: 'Is there anyone who does not want to see all the paramilitaries in permanent retirement? Ending violence is enough of a valid, and long overdue aim in itself without it having to be paid for in concessions or pre-conditions. There can be no concessions to violence.' An NIO spokesman also referred to a speech by the Northern Ireland secretary, Sir Patrick Mayhew, in Coleraine last December: 'In the event of a genuine and established cessation of violence the whole range of responses that we have had to make to that violence could and would inevitably be looked at afresh.' Clearly the biggest hurdle to the entire Hume-Adams initiative, however, is whether terms can now be agreed for the IRA to hand in its weapons, without either the British or Irish governments giving the impression they are in any way negotiating with the IRA or Sinn Fein. Such an impression could prompt a unionist backlash and the well rehearsed cries of a political sell-out, together with a likely escalation of loyalist violence. Neither Mr Hume nor Mr Adams has any illusions that their initiative faces intense hostility from unionists, and both are deeply concerned that the Conservative-UUP alliance at Westminster will prevent their proposals from being fully explored. Mr Hume has raised the stakes by putting his political career on the line in backing the initiative. If it fails, so will his credibility as leader of the SDLP. As the focus now shifts to the British and Irish governments' responses, which are expected next week, they must be well aware of the significance of such a failure and the message it will send to the IRA.

It  said clearly that a continuation of the IRA military campaign  was an obstacle to progress in the peace process.    The refusal by Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, to rush  into a response to December's Downing Street declaration may  smack of pedantry, procrastination and downright deviousness.  But if the message that was repeatedly stated at the latest  hearing of its ""Peace Commission"" has found its target, then the  wait will have been worth it.    The Sinn Fein Peace Commission consists of a series of  public  hearings in Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic, in which  written and oral submissions on the peace process and the  Downing Street declaration are being invited from the public.    The first was held in Londonderry two weeks ago. The second  was held this weekend in a Dublin hotel and two more are  scheduled to be held in the republic before Sinn Fein's annual  congress at the end of this month.    Somewhat surprisingly, the submissions made in Dublin were  neither acrimonious diatribes from opponents, nor eulogies of  regurgitated republicanism from sympathisers. For the most part  they were carefully argued presentations, coming from people as  diverse as Jesuit priests, trade unonists, community  associations, civil rights activists, peace groups hostile to  Sinn Fein, writers and even musicians.    One of the most cogent presentations came from Mr Michael  Farrell, a solicitor and civil rights activist who is widely  respected in republican and nationalist circles.    He started by arguing that the joint declaration and the  British government had failed to address nationalist fears  adequately. But he went on to say that Sinn Fein had been  ""unconvincing"" in trying to draw a distinction between the joint  declaration's guarantee to respect the majority wishes in  Northern Ireland -- described by Sinn Fein as the unionist  ""veto"" -- and the Hume-Adams statements which the IRA supports,  which speak of the need for unionist consent to any new  political settlement.    Moreover, continuation of the IRA campaign while  clarification of the Downing Street declaration was being sought  ""is irresponsible and inconsistent with (the IRA's) own support  for the Hume-Adams proposals,"" he said.    ""Whatever the situation in the past, the means are now in  place to allow republicans to secure their objectives by  political action. I do not believe the IRA's armed struggle  could achieve anything more. Indeed I think it is  counterproductive,"" he said.    Most of the 25 submissions carried a similar message. The  British government should be pressed to offer guarantees to  protect the civil rights and Irish identity of the nationalist  minority in Northern Ireland to balance the ""fulsome guarantees  offered to the unionists."" But in spite of this weakness from a  nationalist point of view, the Downing Street declaration had  opened up new opportunities. Most importantly, a ceasefire  should be declared.    Mr Michael Nugent of the New Consensus movement, a long-time  opponent of the IRA and Sinn Fein, called for the party to ""test  the bona fides"" of the joint declaration and for the IRA to  declare ""a temporary and indefinite ceasefire."" This, he said,  ""would open up an entirely new situation.""    The Sinn Fein convener of the Commission said: ""We are  taking  the submissions very seriously indeed.""     "
0,FT921-10393 ,"FT921-10393 _AN-CBFBEADKFT 920206   FT  06 FEB 92 / Five die in Belfast shooting: Wave of sectarian killings leads to unionist calls for internment      By Our Belfast Correspondent and RALPH ATKINS   PRESSURE on ministers to take decisive action over the handling of Northern Ireland intensified last night after the killing of five Catholics in a Belfast betting shop. The attack was described as 'murder madness' by Sir Hugh Annesley, chief constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary. The prime minister called it a horrific attack which would be repudiated throughout the UK. Loyalist paramilitaries burst into the betting shop in Ormeau Road, south Belfast and fired indiscriminately. Almost every person in the crowded shop was hit. Five men were killed and at least 12 others were taken to hospital. Last night the outlawed Ulster Freedom Fighters, the illegal military wing of the Ulster Defence Association, claimed responsibility. The killings brought to 26 the number of deaths so far this year through terrorist violence in Northern Ireland - a rate reminiscent of the worst years in the 1970s. All of those killed have been civilians. The number of civilian deaths last year was 94. The wave of sectarian killings has intensified pressure on the government to increase still further the efforts of UK security forces in the province. Sir Hugh insisted that the situation was under control, saying security forces were stopping 85 per cent of terrorist attacks before they happened. The suspension last month by the government of its efforts to start 'round-table' talks on the province's future has added to the atmosphere of gloom and drift. Unionists are demanding internment of both loyalist and republican terrorist suspects - a measure not ruled out definitively by Mr Peter Brooke, Northern Ireland secretary, but one that would bring bitter criticism from the Irish government. Mr Brooke will make a statement to the Commons today. Last night he said: 'It is critically important at a time like this for the community to keep its nerve.' Yesterday's killings came 24 hours after a policeman shot dead three men at the advice centre of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, in Belfast. He later committed suicide. Three weeks ago, eight Protestant civilians working for the security forces were killed in an IRA attack at Teebane Cross, County Tyrone. The UFF's statement claiming responsibility for yesterday's attack was headed 'Remember Teebane'. Earlier, an Ulster Defence Regiment soldier shot dead a gunman who attacked him near Northern Ireland's border with the Irish republic. The part-time soldier, who was off-duty at the time, was wounded in the incident. Archbishop Robin Eames, head of the Church of Ireland, said that the province was now witnessing 'unbridled madness'. He went on to say: 'If the killing does not stop, everyone will be sucked into the morass of violence.' At Westminster, however, the demands of nationalist and Unionist MPs for a government statement were tempered by a realisation that there was little prospect of the government offering more than a renewed determination to defeat terrorism and offer sympathy for the victims. Mr Ken Maginnis, the Ulster Unionist party's security spokesman, asked how many more people had to die before internment was reintroduced - regarded by many Unionist MPs as the only alternative which is left to the government.

0,FT923-8172 ,"FT923-8172 _AN-CHQBDABGFT 920813   FT  13 AUG 92 / Northern Ireland bucks downward trend in demand      By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff   DEMAND fell across all parts of the UK except Northern Ireland over the past four months, according to the latest regional trends survey from the Confederation of British Industry and Business Strategies Limited. The biggest falls in demand occurred in the south-west and the Yorkshire and Humberside areas. Only the east Midlands, East Anglia and Northern Ireland reported a small rise in output. The outlook is brightest in the north of England, Wales and Northern Ireland, where orders and output are expected to stabilise in the months ahead. The figures show the difference between those companies reporting an increase in orders over the four months to July and those reporting a decrease. The resulting percentage point balance gives a good indication of the trend in orders. North of England New orders balance: - 1 Conditions are slightly more optimistic than elsewhere in the country. Although home and export orders were flat over the past four months, both are now expected to increase. The decline in output and employment slowed while business confidence continued to increase. The proportion of firms working below capacity was lower than elsewhere in the UK. Yorkshire and Humberside: New orders balance: - 29 A sharp decline in demand for intermediate products - particularly chemicals and metals - affected the region badly. Yorkshire and Humberside was among the regions most disappointed by the volume of orders received over the past four months compared with expectations in April. Business confidence has fallen sharply and demand and output are expected to remain flat over the next four months. East Midlands: New orders balance: - 6 Fared better than other regions over the past four months, with a small increase in output, resulting in a slowdown in the rate of job losses. However, business optimism has fallen sharply and uncertainty over demand is constraining many firms from investing more. East Anglia: New orders balance: - 7 One of the few regions to report a small rise in output over the past four months, but that rise is now expected to be reversed. Although optimism about exports has stabilised, general business confidence has fallen. London and south-east: New orders balance: - 19 Demand for domestic goods fell over the past four months, but held up for exports. The decline in output accelerated and the proportion of companies working below capacity was one of the highest in the country. Redundancies have slowed slightly. South-west: New orders balance: - 33 Exports failed to live up to April's expectations with the result that demand and business confidence fell sharply over the past four months. The proportion of firms working below capacity is now higher than in any other region, and that has led to heavy job losses. Investment intentions weakened slightly. West Midlands: New orders balance: - 19 One of four regions where employment is falling the fastest. However, the fall in output was no longer steeper than that elsewhere in the country. Business confidence was unchanged and a small rise in production is expected. Investment plans indicate a fall in spending on buildings, but spending on plant and machinery should now stabilise. North-west: New orders balance: - 16 In spite of a fall in orders and optimism over the past four months, export and total orders are expected to increase. Job losses are still heavy and show little sign of easing off. Investment is expected to decline at a faster rate. Wales: New orders balance: - 2 Export demand remained buoyant and the outlook is brighter than elsewhere. Output levels have remained stable since the beginning of the year - although sales fell slightly over the past four months. Overseas sales and home orders are expected to rise, so total orders and output levels may increase. Scotland: New orders balance: - 14 Along with the north of England, Scotland continues to be least badly affected by the recession. Business optimism has been maintained in spite of a continuing decline in orders and output. Both are expected to fall again in the next four months. However, export orders - which showed a small increase over the past four months - are expected to rise again. Capacity utilisation remains low and the outlook for investment in buildings, plant and machinery is poor. Northern Ireland: New orders balance: +31 The outlook in Northern Ireland is rosier than anywhere else in the UK. Orders rose for the first time for two years because of stronger domestic demand. Business confidence grew as companies increased production levels in response to rising demand over the past four months. Investment intentions have risen and firms now expect to spend more on plant and machinery in the next 12 months.  The Financial Times   London Page 5  "

One of the better known figures attending last week's party marking the first year of Democracy Now, the parliamentary pressure group for extending Labour party membership to Northern Ireland, was MGN chief executive David Montgomery. Of course, he may just have turned up to chat to fellow Ulster folk. But it suggests that Montgomery may be a little less apolitical than is sometimes portrayed.

A State Department spokesman confirmed yesterday that Mr Adams's visa request had been refused under rules that exclude people who have been involved in terrorist activity. Mr Frank McCloskey, a Democratic congressman from Indiana, said he was very disappointed by the decision. 'Generally speaking freedom of access and people is the best route to go,' he said. The refusal coincides with a visit to Washington by Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland Secretary. In a radio interview in the US capital yesterday, Sir Patrick refused to rule out re-starting talks on the political future of Northern Ireland without the Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionist party. 'I would not want to anticipate any particular format,' Sir Patrick said. Mr Paisley says he will not enter talks until the Irish government makes further concessions on its constitutional claim on the six counties. He also wants Mr John Hume, leader of the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour Party, to stop talks with Sinn Fein. Sir Patrick was due to meet attorney-general Janet Reno yesterday, as well as with a number of members of Congress interested in Northern Ireland, including Mr Thomas Foley, Speaker of the House of Representatives. Mr Adams, who has had visa requests refused several times under previous US administrations, had hoped to visit the US for a book promotion tour. Last April, during a hard-fought primary election in New York state, candidate Clinton told a gathering of Irish-Americans that he thought it would be 'totally harmless to our national security and would widen the political debate in this country' to grant a visa to Mr Adams. He added, however, that he would support a visa for Mr Adams 'or any other properly elected government official recognised by the US.' Two days later, Mr Adams lost his seat in the British parliament. Mr Clinton's initial promise to appoint a peace envoy to Ulster has been scaled down since his election to a fact-finding mission, then becoming a 'willingness to send some kind of representative . . if both parties believe it would help move talks forward.'

0,FT933-4353 ,"FT933-4353 _AN-DIIB8AC7FT 930909   FT  09 SEP 93 / Survey of Northern Ireland (6): Facelift transforms Derry's ancient walls - Optimism in Ulster's second city      By TIM COONE   SITUATED close to Northern Ireland's border with the Irish Republic, Derry has historically been associated with the 'troubles'. But a new mood of optimism has swept the city in recent years, as politicians, businessmen and community leaders have succeeded in putting their religious differences aside to rebuild what is now evolving into a new provincial capital serving communities on both sides of the border. A new, privately-financed Pounds 60m shopping and office complex is emerging from the city's old dockside. Downstream, along the river Foyle, contractors are putting the finishing touches to the city's new port. Tourists are finding attractions in new museums, a craft village and the facelift carried out on Derry's city's 17th century city walls, while locals take encouragement from a new factory that is being built by Seagate, the US computer disk drive manufacturer, which is investing Pounds 45m in a new wafer fabrication plant in the city to supply the European market. The Seagate plant will provide some 500 urgently-needed jobs for the 8,500 currently in Derry's dole queues. It is a far cry from the darkest inward-looking days of the early 1970s, when the civil rights movement was bludgeoned from the streets, Bloody Sunday turned the Catholic community against the British army, and an IRA bombing campaign laid waste to the city centre. Northern Ireland's second city - Londonderry on the maps, but known as Derry to most of its locals - has undergone a transformation as a result of a concerted effort by the Northern Ireland Office to improve the city's roads and infrastructure and to improve housing standards, and by the initiative of locals such as Mr Paddy Doherty, the chairman of the Inner City Trust, who has been a key figure behind the renovation of the city centre. Equally important have been the efforts of Mr John Hume of the SDLP, the local MP, who has rallied the local business community - Protestant and Catholic - to go on trade delegations together to woo US investors and bargain in Brussels for a share of EC structural funds. Mr Michael Black, the president of the Derry Chamber of Commerce, says: 'The city is on the up. There is tremendous confidence and optimism in the business community here. People have stopped griping and are going out to find business. Everybody is now working in the same direction'. The city itself has a population of just 80,000, but its potential economic catchment area embraces the population of the county of Donegal in the Republic, and even parts of Sligo. This adds a further 150,000 people and makes retail developments a particularly attractive proposition, particularly since the removal of customs posts at the border since the beginning of the year, under the new EC Single Market regime. Marks and Spencer is to be the anchor tenant in the new Foyleside shopping complex. once it is completed in early 1995. Mr Damian McAteer, an executive at the EC-funded Business Innovation Centre in the city, says: 'Retail-led development has to be welcomed for the jobs and dynamism it creates, but we have to diversify into manufacturing to create the wages that will sustain the retail sector. We have to look at ourselves as North West plc, with a coherent development strategy for the region.' Mr Paddy Doherty of the Inner City Trust sees the new developments leading to that goal. 'I don't think manufacturers are going to come into a rundown place. It's got to have vitality. Our hope is that on the coat-tails of the inner city regeneration and the commercial developments, we will attract industry here.' One significant development stimulating the existing local industry has been a cross-border project linking the Derry and Letterkenny chambers of commerce. Mr Don McSwiney, the project's chief executive, says: 'The people of Donegal look to Derry as their regional centre. The business community is therefore beginning to structure itself on a regional basis. We are bringing sectoral groups together from both sides of the border to encourage them to work together in purchasing and marketing, to learn from each other's experiences and to stop being inward-looking and to look to Europe as a market.' Working groups are already established in the clothing, textiles, food, drink, information technology, telecommunications, crafts and legal services sectors. Other initiatives are linking up local businessmen with the US market. Mr Ian Young, a board member of North West International (formerly Boston-Derry Ventures) is a Protestant, owner of a local electrical engineering firm. He said that the business community in Derry have found they can do business better by putting aside their political and confessional differences, and as a result have received good responses in the US and in Brussels to their trade missions and lobbying. Mr Black, who is also on the board, said 'We are selling the city as a place for US investment'. The results are beginning to show. Dupont has been in the city for the past 30 years, but Fruit of the Loom, the US clothing manufacturer, is completing a yarn spinning plant in Derry to supply its garments plant across the border at Buncrana, while Seagate began work on its new facility just six months ago. Earlier this year Mr Michael Roarty, the president of the US-Ireland chamber of commerce and vice-president of Anheuser Busch (brewer of Budweiser lager) said the new investments were 'a powerful indicator of the very bright horizons that lie ahead for the city'. Bringing those horizons even closer are the Pounds 22m investment in the new port for Derry, which will handle ships up to 30,000dwt and which has been located alongside a zone earmarked for industrial expansion; and the Pounds 9m recently spent in upgrading the nearby Eglinton airport to accommodate aircraft up to Boeing 737 size. New passenger services to Dublin and London are expected to be opened in 1994. Twenty years ago, it was Derry's historical and geographical problem to have had the Irish border drawn so near to its city limits. Imagination, foresight and political courage have since turned that problem to the city's advantage. For many people in the north-west corner of the island, the border is no longer the barrier it once was.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P9721 International Affairs.

0,FT944-16026 ,"FT944-16026 _AN-EJPAHABMFT 941015   FT  15 OCT 94 / Molyneaux gambles on lasting peace: So far, the UUP is backing its leader      By JOHN MURRAY BROWN   As the Ulster Unionists, the province's main political party, gather in Carrickfergus today for their annual conference, Protestants and Roman Catholics remain far apart. Both nationalist groups - Sinn Fein and the moderate Social Democratic Labour party - are opposed to any form of 'internal solution', while unionists stick to the principle that no change to the status of Northern Ireland can take place without the agreement of the majority. With the emergence this week of a potential third force in unionist politics, with the disavowal of violence by loyalist paramilitaries, there is a danger that unionism, already riven by bitter dispute between the UUP and the more hardline church-based Democratic Unionists led by Rev Ian Paisley, will be further fragmented. Loyalist paramilitaries would appear to share the view of the UUP leader, Mr James Molyneaux, that 'the union is safe'. The DUP remains more sceptical. Mr Peter Robinson, Mr Paisley's would-be heir, said in the Irish Times yesterday that it was 'folly to rely upon the word of any man, especially one who has publicly lied about Northern Ireland in the past'. Mr Molyneaux, pilloried by hardliners, risks being seen as another politician selling out unionist interests. Ominously, some are comparing his performance with the late Brian Faulkner, unionist leader and Northern Ireland premier, who was forced to resign after criticism of his signature of the Sunningdale Agreement in 1973. Some worry that current negotiations go much further than Sunningdale. Mr Molyneaux has put his political reputation on the line by endorsing a deal being drawn up between London and Dublin which at the very least will seek to increase Dublin's role in the affairs of the province. None the less, even if the policy fails and the violence resumes, observers believe Mr Molyneaux could still emerge with honour for having given peace a chance. Mr Chris McGimpsey, a UUP councillor, said: 'There's no point in us giving concessions to the nationalists in negotiations if we can't deliver our people. We're not going to cross the Faulkner line,' So far, there is no sign of dissent within UUP ranks. Mr Molyneaux has shown himself a skilful party manager, balancing the different shades of opinion, and giving real powers to some of his brighter lieutenants - Mr Ken Maginnis, his security spokesman, or Mr David Trimble, who advises on legal issues. The impression is often that these men, not Mr Molyneaux, are driving policy. Mr Molyneaux's line in backing the UK government is now seen to have been taken up by the political representatives of the loyalist paramilitaries, with Mr David Ervine of the Progressive Unionists saying Protestants had nothing to fear from the framework document which London and Dublin are expected to conclude in the next two months. And unlike Mr Paisley, some in the UUP have acknowledged that if the IRA was to announce a permanent ceasefire, Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, could be drawn into the democratic process. The fringe parties now representing loyalist opinion also concede that they may be in talks with Sinn Fein in the near future. With the loyalist ceasefire, and after this weekend's UUP conference, Mr Major will be in a much better position to assess the unionist mood and judge whether the time is right to start the process of bringing Sinn Fein into talks.

Mr Tom Hartley, the national chairman of the IRA's political wing, said in Dublin a response would come only after Sinn Fein's so-called 'peace commission' had completed a series of public debates and consultations on the peace process in both parts of Ireland. This would take place over the next six weeks. The statement came as a visit to the province by Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, coincided with a fresh upsurge in terrorist violence. A woman soldier was shot and seriously injured in a republican area of north Belfast. But troops returned fire, arresting two men and seizing a loaded gun. Separately, the IRA said it had 'made a joke' of the 'colossal sums' spent by the government to fit police and army vehicles with updated armour-piercing weaponry. This followed a rocket attack in east Belfast on Tuesday night which left three policemen injured. Mr Rifkind, who was meeting security chiefs and soldiers, used the visit to hint that the number of troops there could be cut if the IRA responded positively to the UK-Irish declaration. 'Obviously if there was peace in Northern Ireland it would have very important implications for the security force presence which was needed,' Mr Rifkind said. Sinn Fein said the first public debate under its consultation process would be held in Londonderry on January 28. It would be followed by three others in the Republic up to February 19. Mr Pat Doherty, Sinn Fein's vice-president, said 'numerous groups' had requested meetings with the party, including Protestant organisations in Northern Ireland. This 'external consultation' as Sinn Fein calls it, is to take place in parallel with a series of internal party debates. Mr Doherty said that initial soundings within the party taken since the declaration was published on December 15 suggested there was 'an element of disappointment'. He added: 'But we wish to explore whether there is a genuine opportunity for peace in this document.' Mr Hartley confirmed that Mr Gerry Adams, the party president, had written to both the British and Irish prime ministers for 'clarifications'. Downing Street said yesterday it had not yet decided how to respond to Mr Adams' letter.   Countries:-  IEZ  Ireland, EC.   Industries:-  P9721 International Affairs.

0,FT943-6019 ,"FT943-6019 _AN-EIAD1ABQFT 940901   FT  01 SEP 94 / The IRA Ceasefire: Unionists divided in degrees of scepticism      By TIM COONE and DAVID OWEN   The response by Northern Ireland's unionists to the IRA ceasefire will be crucial in determining how far the two governments can respond to it, consolidating it into what Dublin already believes is a permanent ceasefire. Initial unionist reactions have been ambivalent and sceptical. Mr Jim Wilson, general secretary of the Ulster Unionist party, said the IRA ceasefire did not meet the conditions of the Downing Street declaration and 'should not therefore trigger the process in which Sinn Fein could enter into exploratory talks with the British government'. Sitting across the negotiating table from Sinn Fein is 'way, way down the road', he said. If there is a permanent end to IRA violence though, and after exploratory talks between Sinn Fein and the British government, 'as a democratic party we would envisage a situation in which we would talk to other democratically elected parties'. Mr James Molyneaux, leader of the UUP, emerged from an hour-long meeting with prime minister John Major at Downing Street to say that he did not think the IRA's statement was sufficient to start the clock ticking in the lead-up to talks between London and Sinn Fein. 'I hope those who have influence with Sinn Fein/IRA will be able to take the next step and make it permanent,' Mr Molyneaux said. In a message to loyalist paramilitaries, Mr Molyneaux said there was 'no justification or excuse for violence on the part of anyone.' The hardline Democratic Unionist party has been predictably apocalyptic in its response. Mr Ian Paisley, the DUP leader, was earlier this week warning of a 'civil war' if the IRA ceasefire involved a deal with the British government. Mr Gregory Campbell, a DUP councillor from Derry, said: 'The IRA is replacing violence as a means of achieving its aims, with the threat of violence. Does anybody believe there has been no deal? We await with great interest what the British government has agreed to do in return.' The DUP remains steadfastly opposed to talks with Sinn Fein at any stage in the peace process, and has refused to enter round-table talks even with the other parties in the province unless the Downing Street declaration is rescinded. With the prospect of inclusive round-table talks still some way off, of immediate concern for the politicians and the security forces in Northern Ireland is whether there will be a backlash from the loyalist paramilitaries which could undermine the IRA ceasefire. The Combined Loyalist Military Command, the umbrella group for the two main protestant paramilitary groups, the UVF and the UFF, appears to be waiting to see what happens. In a statement yesterday it said: 'We will not be dancing to the Pan-nationalist tune,' and added: 'Is our constitution being tampered with or is it not? What deals have been done? End the speculation. No further comment will be forthcoming from the Combined Loyalist Military Command at present.' Perhaps the most encouraging signal that loyalist reaction may be restrained has come from Mr Hugh Smyth, Belfast's Lord Mayor, who is a member of the Progressive Unionist party, whose political base is in the loyalist Shankill Road area in Belfast and is considered close to the Ulster Volunteer Force. He welcomed yesterday's 'opportunity for peace' and urged the people of Northern Ireland to 'grasp this opportunity because history will not treat us kindly if we throw this opportunity away, providing that there is no sell-out. I believe we should all work now for peace, stability and political progress through reconciliation.' He described Republican aspirations for a united Ireland as 'legitimate' as long as they are not pursued by violent means. The key issue facing unionist leaders in the weeks ahead, therefore, will be whether they can bury their differences to confront what is now likely to emerge as a powerful nationalist alliance with agreed negotiating goals, between the mainly Catholic SDLP and Sinn Fein in Northern Ireland, backed by Fianna Fail and Labour in the government in the Republic. Failure to do so may well see a further erosion of unionist aspirations.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.     IEZ  Ireland, EC.   Industries:-  P9721 International Affairs.

0,FT931-5113 ,"FT931-5113 _AN-DCHCJABTFT 930308   FT  08 MAR 93 / The Week Ahead   RESULTS DUE HEADLINE pre-tax profits from BTR, the industrial conglomerate, should have increased from Pounds 917m in 1991 to comfortably exceed Pounds 1bn last year, although about Pounds 50m will come from profits on disposals. Analysts at Thursday's meeting will be interested in what benefits have come from the integration of Hawker Siddeley, taken over for Pounds 1.55bn at the end of 1991, and current trading conditions in the US. BAT Industries, the tobacco and financial services group, is expected to report annual pre-tax profits of more than Pounds 1.55bn, up from Pounds 1.05bn, on Wednesday. Interest will centre on whether recent strong growth in cigarette sales can be maintained, and how Eagle Star is recovering from the heavy losses it has incurred on mortgage indemnity policies. Full year results from RTZ, the world's largest mining company, due on Thursday were foreshadowed last month when the group said there would be an exceptional charge of Pounds 52m, compared to a Pounds 74m charge in 1991. RTZ plans to adopt FRS 3. Net income, the line RTZ prefers to focus on, is expected to rise from Pounds 308m to around Pounds 330m, after interim net income was up from Pounds 154m to Pounds 158m. A maintained final is likely. On Wednesday, Cadbury Schweppes is expected to announce pre-tax profits of about Pounds 325m for the full year, up from Pounds 316.4m last time. Trading profits in Britain and the US are thought to have finished the year on a strong note. TI, the specialist engineering group, is expected to produce pre-tax profits of about Pounds 109m, up from Pounds 105.2m, and earings of 18p, when it reports results for 1992 on Thursday. The company has underperformed since its acquisition last year of Dowty, which has suffered from the sharp deterioration in sentiment in the aerospace industry. Both GKN and TN, the motor components groups, saw profits bounce back in the first half of last year as they reaped the benefits of cost-cutting and overseas investment. While full-year increases - to be announced on Wednesday - are expected to top 30 per cent in both cases, questions will be raised about the state of the German car market and other parts of the continent. As a counterweight, the news should be good on US demand. GKN is expected to report Pounds 125m, compared with Pounds 95m, while the consensus for TN is Pounds 65m, against Pounds 49m. The former's dividend should be roughly covered, but TN's will not be yet again. The betting is that TN will nevertheless hold the payment.

That brings to more than 800 the number of job losses in Northern Ireland this week. The company, a subsidiary of Northern Telecom Incorporated of Canada, makes advanced transmission systems, terminals, telephone sets and fax machines. It said the job cuts were necessary to enhance long-term business prospects. 'A number of the redundancies will reflect lower-than-forecast levels of demand in some areas, symptomatic of the general economic climate.' Northern Telecom was formerly STC (Northern Ireland). In February, STC made 350 temporary employees redundant at the Monkstown plant. Mr Richard Needham, the province's economy minister, said: 'Northern Telecom (Incorporated of Canada) is a major multinational with an annual turnover of close to CDollars 9bn (Pounds 4.58bn) and 62,000 employees. With the telecommunications sector throughout Europe undergoing rapid and far-reaching change, the company has been examining how the former STC telecommunications operations might be restructured for the long term.' Mr Needham said that under the new business structure, the company would continue as a high-technology plant responsible for the manufacture and development of new products.

0,FT931-16787 ,"FT931-16787 _AN-DAEB7ABSFT 930105   FT  05 JAN 93 / Loyalist paramilitaries reject SDLP talks offer   LOYALIST paramilitaries in Northern Ireland last night rejected an offer of talks with nationalists amid fears of an escalating murder campaign against Roman Catholics. The banned Ulster Freedom Fighters, one of the Protestant groups involved in a wave of sectarian shootings, said it was not prepared to sit down with Mr Seamus Mallon, the deputy leader of the predominantly Catholic SDLP and MP for Newry and Armagh. Mr Mallon had challenged loyalist gunmen to meet him after the Ulster Volunteer Force claimed responsibility for the first serious terrorist attack of 1993 - the murders of a Catholic father and son near Dungannon, Co Tyrone. Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, said yesterday: 'We will bring quite impartially the full force of the law - the army supporting the RUC - against people of whatever persuasion who use violence for political ends.' He rejected holding any negotiations with those who used violence for political ends. 'If violence is abandoned, disavowed, forsworn, set behind them by the IRA, and they give us sufficient time to see that that is for real, and that they mean it, then people will talk to them,' he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. He said he believed a debate was under way in the IRA and its political wing Sinn Fein and many realised they could not win through violence. Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein and a former MP, said that if Sir Patrick was serious about peace he should initiate a dialogue. 'The Sinn Fein view is quite clear,' he said on BBC Radio 4's The World at One programme. 'There should be a demilitarisation of the situation.' He added: 'Mayhew has to start peace talks.

0,FT922-13135 ,"FT922-13135 _AN-CDNA2ABQFT 920414   FT  14 APR 92 / UK Company News: Banks persuaded not to drop Aitch - Stitching together a clothing company's rescue      By RICHARD GOURLAY   THE LADIES at Aitch Holding's shirt factory in Lurgen, Northern Ireland, hardly ever seem to pause for breath. Fleet of finger at the best of times - they are paid on a piece work basis - they are also acutely aware that Coats Viyella, a much larger competitor, has cut 900 jobs in Northern Ireland in the year, 566 of them last week. Lurgen's ladies would not, however, be working today were it not for the many hundreds of hours put in by Aitch's bankers and its new management, dedicated to putting together a rescue plan, as well as the intervention of a government department and the Bank of England. The Aitch rescue, which its shareholders were yesterday asked to approve along with a name change to Dunkeld Group, may not rank in size alongside the refinancings of Brent Walker or News International. But it is an example of banks, faced with huge losses, taking the responsible route of allowing management to work out a bad loan, thereby saving jobs, rather than putting the company in the hands of receivers. But it was a close decision. Hill Samuel, Aitch's bankers had begun to put in the receivers last September, ending a sad and expensive episode for Mr Harry Rogers, its founder. Following the reversal of Mr Rogers' private clothes company into the quoted Munton group in 1988, Aitch was producing in Northern Ireland and London, it had sales offices in Belgium and a buying office in the Far East. It was also losing unknown amounts of money in Northern Ireland, and from a raft of smaller companies in a wide range of garment related businesses. The concentration by the Northern Ireland operation on short production runs of branded shirts, including the Ben Sherman, Pierre Balmain, Tern and Panache labels, meant costs were excessively high by comparison with manufacturers in the Far East. Combined with operational problems at the contract shirts operations in Northern Ireland, the company was heading for the rocks. By early last year, it was clear that losses in these areas were not going to be offset by and Gottfried  Paul ladies leisurewear businesses and that ordinary trading would not reduce debts. Hill Samuel, owed Pounds 9.5m, and FennoScandia, owed Pounds 2.5m, were getting nervous. Just how badly the company had fallen was demonstrated in February when it reported losses after tax and extraordinary items of Pounds 18.73m in the year to November 1991, taking the company far into negative shareholders' funds territory . At its peak in 1989, Aitch had commanded a market capitalisation of only Pounds 13m. With this track record, it took escapology worthy of Harry Houdini for Aitch to unwind Hill Samuel's decision to send in the receivers. Over one stress-filled night, Mr Michael Green, a corporate doctor and entrepreneur appointed by the board to sort out the problems in Northern Ireland, and Mr Jon Sachs, a director of the Bank of Ireland, managed to amass enough of an argument to convince Hill Samuel to hold off the receivers for two weeks until the new management team had put together a recovery plan. Mr Sachs says the subsequent efforts to get the restructuring to stand up was something of an 'Indian rope trick'. It rested partly on the argument that the banks simply should not be walking away from 700 group jobs without fully investigating whether there was an alternative. This was one of a number of less than conventional interventions in the ensuing months, not the least of which was the role the Bank of England played in acting as a mediator between Hill Samuel and FennoScandia. Equally important was the role of the Industrial Development Board of Northern Ireland. Mr Green's proposed restructuring, the Province's development bank argued, would not only secure jobs but would lead to a group that could be viable. The IDB, which has recently become much more hard nosed about backing viable concerns and not just large employers, took the important step of backing the restructuring with Pounds 500,000 of new capital. But Aitch's stay of execution had as much to do with the fact that it was entering a trading period during which it would be pulling in more cash than it would spend, making the banks no worse off for not pulling the plug immediately. This breathing space allowed Mr Green to pull together the business plan. From the beginning he argued that Aitch was never going to trade its way out of trouble and would need to build a few of its better businesses for sale. In addition the banks would have to grant management three years grace to do this. Mr Green convinced the banks this was the right way forward. Following many more hours of 'last minute hitches', Hill Samuel and FennoScandia have taken a 9.9 per cent stake, while the new management has nearly 17 per cent. As the group emerges from the restructuring, Mr Green says profitability of all four of Aitch's labels will rise and that unprofitable businesses have been sold. Northern Ireland now fulfils almost nothing but contract orders of shirts, the branded business is almost solely supplied from imports. There remains, however, the matter of a Pounds 8.2m deficit on shareholders' funds as of last November, after taking into account sales of businesses and the conversion of bank debt in to equity. To climb out from under this weight and return to the dividend list, Aitch will almost certainly have to build one of its remaining businesses and then sell it. Only then can its employees in Lurgen be certain they will not go the way of the employees at Coats Viyella.  The Financial Times   London Page 22  "

Repeating statements he made in Northern Ireland early in July, Mr Hevesi said Irish Americans would be willing buyers of such bonds, just as Jewish Americans have bought substantial amounts of Israeli bonds. 'A constructive peace process will have a major effect on investment in Ireland, north and south,' he said. The comptroller has used his position as a custodian of New York's public-employee retirement fund to justify his statements on Irish affairs. The fund has Dollars 6bn (Pounds 4bn) invested in companies which have business interests in Northern Ireland.

0,FT923-5138 ,"FT923-5138 _AN-CIDBKAFZFT 920902   FT  02 SEP 92 / Ulster talks to resume at crucial stage      By TIM COONE   ROUND-TABLE talks on the political future of Northern Ireland resume in Belfast today after a 40-day recess, entering what the participants believe to be the most crucial stage of the three-strand talks process which started last April. The aim of the process is an agreed formula for self-rule in Northern Ireland, to replace the 1985 Anglo-Irish agreement. A month has been set aside for the current round of talks, which will include representatives from the four main political parties in the province as well as the British and Irish governments. Sir Ninian Stephen, the former governor-general of Australia, will chair the meetings. Preliminary discussions took place yesterday to agree an agenda, establish ground rules and organise a manageable negotiating structure. The discussions will involve three days of meetings each week, initially at Stormont Castle in Belfast, then moving to Dublin, probably in the last week of September. It will be the first time since partition in 1922 that Unionist political leaders have travelled on official business to Dublin. The talks are part of 'strand two' of the three-strand process. Talks in July were seen as a preliminary phase, during which the six groups laid out their positions and faced questioning by others. The real negotiations are now expected to get under way. Signs of flexibility will be sought - for example, whether the Irish government is prepared to relax or amend its constitutional territorial claim to Northern Ireland, and whether the unionist parties are prepared to concede some role for Dublin in a future Ulster administration. Strict confidentiality and a news blackout have been imposed on the discussions, as it is feared that any leaks before a final agreement is reached could endanger the talks. In spite of some breaches of confidentiality, there is a sense that progress has been made, if only to bring the main Ulster political parties together with the two governments. The three-strand political talks are based on a complex programme agreed by the participants in April last year. In 'strand one' local politicians discussed devolution in Northern Ireland with the UK government. In 'strand two' the Dublin government has entered the discussions on the relations between north and south Ireland. This round of talks is scheduled to finish by September 28, after which a new meeting of the Anglo-Irish conference, set up under the 1985 Hillsborough agreement, is due to be held. Unionist leaders refused to participate in the current talks unless the Anglo-Irish conference was suspended, which it has been since April.  The Financial Times   London Page 7  "

It has also received only a lukewarm reception in the republic. Mr Reynolds told a Fianna Fail youth conference that he would be prepared to give a 'personal guarantee' to Northern Ireland's political parties of a 30 per cent participation in a future all-Ireland government. This would in effect give unionists 20 per cent of seats in an all-Ireland cabinet, and similar representation in the Irish civil service. However Mr Molyneaux, speaking from Washington, where he is beginning a week-long visit to the US, dismissed the proposal as 'totally, totally unrealistic . . . the greater number of people of Northern Ireland are not orphans wandering about a barren landscape waiting for somebody to take them in'. Mr John Bruton, the leader of the opposition Fine Gael party in the republic, also criticised the proposal for being a 'diversion' which would distract attention 'from solving practical problems . . . many things need to be done in the short term to build up trust'. Even Mr Reynolds' Labour coalition partners were lukewarm. The party said: 'In principle we are in favour of power-sharing . . . but that is a very long way down the road and there are an awful lot of bridges that would have to be crossed before we could get to that point.' However a spokesman for Mr Reynolds said the Unionist reaction was expected and the proposal would 'remain on the table to be built upon'. He added: 'Mr Reynolds felt that if we believe in (a united Ireland) we had better start saying what it will entail.'   Countries:-  IEZ  Ireland, EC.   Industries:-  P9721 International Affairs.

In his speech to the Institute of Directors in Belfast, Mr Major admitted he was taking risks on the IRA's intentions after its refusal to spell out explicitly that its campaign of violence had ended for good. But he made clear that his aim was to create an environment in Northern Ireland which would make it difficult if not impossible for the IRA to return to violence. Alongside the government's 'working assumption' that the IRA ceasefire was intended to be permanent and its willingness to open exploratory talks with Sinn Fein before the end of the year, Mr Major listed a series of immediate confidence-building measures: All border crossings between the north and the republic are to be re-opened; The exclusion orders on Mr Gerry Adams and Mr Martin McGuinness of Sinn Fein have been rescinded. They are free to travel anywhere within the UK, provided they remain committed to the democratic process. Other exclusion orders will remain in place for the time being; Troop levels will be reviewed in relation to the threat but the government's 'firm objective' is to return to exclusively civilian policing; The government will enter 'at the appropriate time' into contact with loyalist paramilitaries and consider how the interests of such groups can be represented in the political talks process; A conference in Belfast in December involving investors from Britain, Europe, America and the Far East will aim to boost the flow of inward investment into the province. A task force is developing a new European Union initiative for Northern Ireland which will result in a substantial injection of 'new money'. The prime minister said that the proposed talks with Sinn Fein would rest on the assumption that it continued to establish a commitment to 'exclusively peaceful methods' and on the IRA's continuing to show it had ended terrorism, Over the medium term there could be no assurance of peace until the paramilitaries on both sides had handed over their weapons. He intended to develop a joint approach with the Dublin government on the 'deposit' and 'decommissioning' of guns and explosives. In a reference to the demands of republican groups for 'self-policing' Mr Major insisted: 'No groups will be allowed to take the law into their own hands. All sections of the community must have confidence in the police.' Turning to the framework document under discussion with the Republic to establish new relations between the two governments and between the north and south, Mr Major said it would be based on an 'unshakeable' constitutional guarantee to the people of Ulster that they would decide their own future. It would be a basis for negotiations rather than a blueprint. Meanwhile the British government would produce its own proposals for devolution of political power to a Northern Ireland assembly. The restoration of local accountability meant neither a purely internal solution, nor a return to domination of one side by the other, would achieve this. Finally - and importantly - Mr Major reiterated that all proposals for the province's political future would be published before any negotiations between the political parties. The eventual settlement would be submitted to a referendum in the province.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P9711 National Security.     P9199 General Government, NEC.

No matter. John Major is also sleepwalking: uncertain from one day to the next whether he is talking to the bosses of the terrorists. And Gerry Adams is far away in the land of nod if he thinks that easy victories on American TV can sanctify murder or disguise the growing ascendancy of protestant gunmen. Let us hope that both are dancing to a tune we cannot hear and that Ireland will one day awaken to its harmony. Meanwhile, here is a different dream. It begins with the ghost of Machiavelli, asking briskly: 'Why do you English stay in Northern Ireland: for profit, sentiment, for glory or because you fear the contagion of a religious war? Which side do you support? If neither, why do you give them both money?' The spirit of that prince of civil servants began to fade. 'Stay,' I cried. 'Everyone except our government knows that these are the right questions. But how shall we answer?' He returned into focus, with the sardonic smile which so irritated Lorenzo de' Medici. 'I have written,' he replied, 'That a foreign power cannot succeed by generosity alone; for the people's gratitude is fickle. A liberal rule must be tempered by severity. Hannibal, for example, avoided insurrection because his fine qualities included extreme brutality . . .' 'No doubt, no doubt' I said, 'But we abandoned even the mildest torture decades ago after The Sunday Times discovered that prisoners were being made to stand against a wall . . .Yes, we have tried locking up all suspects, including the innocent. But as you said in 1513, that sort of thing foments unrest.' 'And you no longer exact tribute from their lands,' he mused. 'No,' I replied. 'English settlers were once rapacious. There was hunger and oppression. But now the province is part of our kingdom, just like Kent or Wales. The people there get the same benefits as in Great Britain even though they generate less wealth.' 'So you must pay . . ' 'Yes, Pounds 3,200m a year, plus another Pounds 400m for an army to stop them killing each other. That is about Pounds 43 a week per head.' Machiavelli looked puzzled, so I explained: 'We give every person in Northern Ireland the equivalent of a 20kg sack of silver each year.' His lip curled: 'You are much loved for this?' 'No. Powerful Americans believe the Irish are still enslaved and send them money for explosives. The Irish think state benefits are theirs by right (as people do in England). The protestants fear we will take away their privileges, and the catholics grumble because so many cannot find work. 'You pay them even if they do not work?' 'Of course. Especially if they do not work.' 'Including the terrorists?' 'Perhaps, if they have no work.' 'Few successful rulers have paid rebels who kill their own soldiers,' he said. 'But we are a democracy.' 'Nevertheless, your rulers must force both sides to understand how much is being paid and exact conditions for the money. This cannot be done, you agree, so long as Northern Ireland is treated like your Kent. Perhaps the province could be given a kind of independence. The protestants should then be warned that the grant will be cut unless they behave, and the catholics would see that if they were to join the Republic they would be very much poorer.' 'We tried this.' 'You must be more ruthless. And this time get rid of the terrorists. Kill or imprison all that you prudently can. Bribe the rest. Give very large bribes to the leaders; then they will control their comrades and inform on any who break ranks. This will be much cheaper than paying Pounds 400m to your soldiers. Of course these payments must be disguised: perhaps as a rehabilitation fund run by Norwegians.' 'But this is totally unacceptable.' 'Then keep your dreams,' he said and faded into the dawn.

Publishing a report on the commission's findings in Dublin  yesterday, Mr Pat Doherty, Sinn Fein vice-president, said: ""We  will have to take on board the views of people who spoke to us.  It has certainly informed our attitude and we would not have  involved ourselves in dialogue with so many people if we were to  ignore it. It would have an influence on our thinking... as to  how we should proceed in the weeks and months ahead.""    He said Sinn Fein would make a detailed response to the  Downing Street declaration before the end of next month probably  before the proposed Anglo-Irish summit -- pencilled in for the  latter part of the month. A document had already been drafted  by the party's national executive, he said, which must be  discussed with party members first. ""But this will not unduly  delay our response,"" he said.    The report published yesterday is a summary of the 280  submissions made to the commission from across Northern Ireland  and the Irish Republic during the five hearings.    It does not make any specific recommendations, but it does  highlight two points which are likely to be central to Sinn  Fein's response to the Downing Street declaration, namely the  so-called unionist veto and the issue of demilitarisation. The  report notes: ""A huge range of submissions felt...that the  declaration had fudged the issue of self-determination"" and says  that ""the need to remove the veto"" should be subject to ""further  debate and discussion.""    Mr Doherty insisted that majority consent in Northern  Ireland  to constitutional change, as embodied in the Downing Street  declaration, was distinct from the unionist veto. He added:  ""The Irish nation is bigger than the unionist  population...consent means (unionist) involvement and maybe even  more than that, but there cannot be a veto."" He said Sinn Fein  was also looking for a means to achieve ""a total  demilitarisation of the conflict"" rather than focusing on just  one aspect of it, namely the IRA.    Sinn Fein thus appears to be moving towards proposing an  extended IRA ceasefire, as opposed to the total cessation of  violence as demanded by the two governments. This would be in  the hope firstly of shifting the political pressure on to the  loyalist paramilitaries.     "

The quangos which control funding for universities - the higher education funding councils for England, Scotland and Wales and the Department of Education for Northern Ireland - said they wanted to address complaints by employers that funding was skewed towards basic or academic research. They also intend to implement proposals to improve technology foresight published in last year's science white paper. The new rules will be applied to the university research assessment exercise which starts in 1996. The judgments it then makes on the quality of research will determine research funding from 1997 onwards. Total government research funding for that year has not yet been decided, but this year's budget from the Department for Education, for English universities alone, was Pounds 618m. Mr Bahram Bekhradnia, head of policy for the Higher Education Funding Council for England, said the council hoped to appoint industrialists to the panels which will judge the university departments. They would work jointly with the leading academics who now control funding. Requirements that departments submit only published academic research will be dropped. Now patents, and the results of industrial research for companies, will be judged on the same basis. This means a university doing only industrial research could still attract a top allocation of research funding if the research is of high quality. The Scottish funding council has the power to steer extra funds to specific subjects if they are important to the local economy. It is still discussing whether to do so.

As pressure continued to mount on London to depart from its cautious stance, Downing Street said that there was a continuing need to 'be clear that the IRA's violence had ended for good'. It said ministers would 'keep the situation under close review'. The comments followed the first full meeting of the cabinet since July, at which ministers were briefed on the Ulster situation by Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary. Mr John Major is expected to visit the province soon. Meanwhile Mr Andrew Hunter, the pro-unionist chairman of the Tory backbench Northern Ireland committee, last night fuelled speculation that the six-year-old broadcasting ban on representatives of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, might be lifted. He said: 'The time may soon come when it is right to lift the ban.' Ministers are thought to have agreed in principle that the ban should go. Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, urged London to accept the IRA ceasefire as permanent 'as soon as they can', warning that any delay might be used by loyalist paramilitaries as an excuse for violence. But he accepted that the timing of the decision had to be taken by London 'and they have to bring the unionist population with them'. Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, accused Mr Major of 'trawling around for excuses not to get involved'. Britain has promised to start talks on how to admit Sinn Fein into the political process within three months of a permanent end to violence. A poll for The Guardian by ICM published today showed that only 13 per cent of those questioned believed the violence would cease for good.

We have had plenty of words, but it is not words people  want.  The huge numbers of people in the north and south of Ireland, in  the United Kingdom, the United States and elsewhere, who support  the Joint Declaration, want an end to violence. An end to  sickening events like last week's killing of a community  policeman by the IRA. An end to murders, equally atrocious,  equally pointless, by the loyalist paramilitaries.    Professions do not sit well with bombs and bullets.    Albert Reynolds and I are at one in seeking peace in  Northern  Ireland. That was why we negotiated the Joint Declaration. It  is for us, a foundation stone, a set of principles which will  stand the test of time.    Two months on from the Declaration, no-one, I believe, can  credibly argue that it is not properly understood. The  Declaration is clear. If there is genuine doubt about anything  it says, the text itself can dispel that doubt. We shall not  open back-door negotiations by glossing or shading the  Declaration's language and meaning.    Let me repeat what it says about self-determination, because  this has been misrepresented.    First the British government has no...""selfish, strategic or  economic interest in Northern Ireland.""    That doesn't mean that we don't care about it, nor that we  don't share the interest of its people in a secure, prosperous  and peaceful future.    It does mean that we would have no reason to wish to  frustrate the democratically expressed wishes of the people. We  shall abide by these wishes, and if the people prefer to remain  in the United Kingdom, as they have done so far, we shall uphold  their right to do so.    Second, our primary interest is to see peace, stability and  reconciliation established by agreement among all the people who  inhabit the Island. We will work with the constitutional  parties and Irish government to achieve such an agreement, which  may, as of right, take the form of agreed structures for the  island as a whole, including a united Ireland achieved by  peaceful means. But, again, I emphasise this must be by consent  not imposition.    The way such agreement is to be achieved is set out clearly.    We say that ""it is for the people of the island of Ireland  alone, by agreement between the two parts respectively, to  exercise their right of self-determination on the basis of  consent, freely and concurrently given, north and south, to  bring about a united Ireland, if that is their wish.""    Third, we will ""introduce the necessary legislation to give  effect to this, or equally to any measure of agreement on future  relationships in Ireland which the people living in Ireland may  themselves freely so determine without external impediment.""    In short, democracy will prevail. No other route is  possible.    The Joint Declaration leaves no conceivable reason for  continued violence. The reasons given by the republican  movement in the past no longer exist. That is not just my view.  It is the view which has been expressed by the most respected  leaders of the nationalist community, including of course, John  Hume.    Does Mr Adams share this view? If not, why not? The people  have the right to know. He cannot be permitted to argue for  peace and yet frustrate it.    If Sinn Fein believes in peace, the violence should stop.    Let me be plain on another point. The British government  will, as I said in the Declaration, ""encourage, facilitate and  enable the achievement of such agreement."" We will, however,  not try to persuade people to go for Irish unity. It is not the  government's job to tell the Irish people what they should  think, or to dictate to them where their future should lie.    But what we do advocate is agreement, reached freely and  democratically. I do not believe that the Irish people want the  British government to coerce the greater number in the north  into a united Ireland against their will. Nor does the  Taoiseach [Irish Prime Minister Albert Reynolds]. Albert  Reynolds has publicly opposed such coercion. He has said in the  Joint Declaration that a united Ireland should not be imposed.  We both believe that the people living the island of Ireland,  north and south respectively, should decide. There can be no  coercion.    Before the Declaration was published, there was a lot of  speculation about what it would say. Many confident predictions  were made, most of them wrong.    So I point out, once it was published, all those things it  did not say which people had been led to expect. It did not set  out or require any particular outcome; after all, it is not a  solution. But nor does the Declaration rule anything out,  providing only it is achieved peacefully, by agreement and  consent.    What matters now is what is in the Declaration, and that it  provides a foundation for progress towards a lasting settlement.  What matters is to end the killing. Every death, every injury,  every bereavement is an affront. Over a quarter of a century,  violence has made no headway. But it has caused terrible pain  on both sides of the community. The voices raised against  violence on all sides have grown stronger and more insistent  over the past year. They helped us to produce the Joint  Declaration. They explain the extraordinary level of support  given to it. The overwhelming majority of the people of  Northern Ireland want an end to violence now. Will their voices  be heeded?    Sinn Fein claims not to understand the place of the  Declaration in a ""peace process."" There is nothing obscure  about this either. The Declaration is not a peace plan. It  certainly isn't a solution on its own. It is simply the view of  the two governments about the principles involved in a process  leading to an agreed outcome.    Those central principles are democracy, and an absence of  coercion - in other words consent, no outside interference and  an end to violence.    As a first step, those principles have to be publicly  accepted and acted upon.    We would be ready within three months of an end to violence  to begin an exploratory dialogue with Sinn Fein. Its aims would  be to discuss how Sinn Fein would become involved in the  three-stranded political talks how they could be brought fully  into normal political life in Northern Ireland, and what the  consequence of ending violence would be. They know this is our  intention; we told them of it last November.    I believe this amounts to a substantial exploratory agenda.    Those exploratory discussions would in themselves be part of  the process of bringing Sinn Fein back into normal political  life, in developing a normal political dialogue between the  government and other parties, on matters like education,  housing, healthcare, crime and fair employment.    They could only take place against a background where  violence had no place. As confidence returned, the pracical  consequences of that would be felt across Northern Ireland.    The question of continuing violence is the key. I heartily  endorse the idea that the gun should be taken out of Irish  politics. But who has kept it there? Last year terrorists (not  all of them republican by any means) killed 86 people. The  security forces killed none. If the terrorists discard the gun  for good, we shall in time be able to manage without British  soldiers in support of the RUC and without emergency legislation.    Now as to the political talks. As the Taoiseach and I  declared and I declared last Saturday [19 February]; the talks  process is moving ahead. Sinn Fein are free to come in to  democratic life. They can stay out, if they so decide. But  they can't hold the talks up. It would be wrong of me to  predict their outcome, but certain things are plain.    First, civil rights must and will be carefully protected.  Power must be exercised fairly. We are all resolved on that.    Second, I expect to see institutions and new relationships  reflecting the common interests in the island, as it faces the  challenges of a competitive world and the opportunities of  politial agreement. The character and depth of these is very  much for discussion.    Third, the two governments will be building on the close  partnership we already have as members of the European Union and  as good neighbours in these islands.    Whatever may be the shape of final agreement in the talks,  it  will not be imposed on anyone. It will be the people who will  have decided.    There is no purpose in living in the past. Dreadful deeds  have been done by all sides in past centuries. We should all  regret that, but those of us alive today are not responsible for  them.    Our generation must look to the future. We want to give to  the people power to take the decisions affecting their own  lives. Will Sinn Fein take the opportunity? Will they now  renounce violence, and trust the people? Or will they continue  to inflict on the people further cruel and futile violence?     "
0,FT934-8472 ,"FT934-8472 _AN-DKPCNAAEFT 931116   FT  16 NOV 93 / Turmoil over Ulster peace offer: Sinn Fein claims 'contact' with government as PM acts to break deadlock      By KEVIN BROWN and DAVID OWEN   FRESH efforts by Mr John Major to inject momentum into the Dublin-Westminster peace initiative for Northern Ireland were thrown into confusion last night when Sinn Fein asserted it had already been in talks with the British government. Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, chose the night that the prime minister made his first explicit offer to negotiate with the IRA's political wing - in return for an end to violence - to claim that Sinn Fein had been in 'protracted contact and dialogue' with the government. Mr Adams said it was Mr Major who broke off the dialogue. The claim, which followed reports in the province that such meetings had taken place earlier this year, brought an immediate denial from Downing Street, which said there had been no negotiations between the British government and Sinn Fein. It said the only contacts made had been those permitted at local and constituency level. It would not comment on a separate claim from republicans in Belfast that documents had been exchanged. Earlier last night Mr Major told the Lord Mayor's banquet in the City that 'there may now be a better opportunity for peace in Northern Ireland than for many years'. In his speech, Mr Major ruled out any secret deals with terrorists, and insisted that the government would 'never' talk to organisations which declined to renounce violence. His remarks brought a mixed response from unionist leaders. Mr Ken Maginnis, security spokesmen for the Ulster Unionist party, said he had found 'nothing new' in them. The Reverend Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionist party, said he would never talk to Sinn Fein. He had 'some evidence' of secret meetings between the Northern Ireland Office and Sinn Fein, he added. Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish premier, welcomed Mr Major's comments, and said he agreed that everyone would have to show courage and take risks to try to secure peace. Mr Major stressed that the government would insist on a permanent cessation of violence before talking to Sinn Fein. 'But if the IRA end violence for good, then, after a sufficient interval to ensure the permanence of their intent, Sinn Fein can enter the political arena as a democratic party and join the dialogue on the way ahead,' he said. His speech confirmed that the government was prepared to press ahead without the participation of the DUP. The possibility that the British and Irish governments might be willing to talk to Sinn Fein was first raised in a joint declaration in Brussels last month by Mr Major and Mr Reynolds. Downing Street said Mr Major's comments were intended as a clear demonstration that the government was 'very serious' about the peace process. However, Mr Adams responded that Mr Major's speech was 'little more than an attempt to camouflage his rejection of peace'. 'This is not about a place for Sinn Fein at the conference table. We will be there. Our electorate have decided that,' he said. 'Indeed, representatives of Sinn Fein have been in protracted contact and dialogue with the British Government. It was John Major who broke off that contact at the behest of his Unionist allies. 'Mr Major cannot dodge his responsibilities so easily. He must grasp the opportunity for peace, not play politics with it,' Mr Adams said. Major stresses link between traditional values and success Page 10   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

The three main opposition parties, Fine Gael, the Progressive Democrats and Democratic Left, have been concerned that Mr Reynolds, in pushing hard for an accommodation of nationalist aspirations in the joint declaration, would alienate unionist opinion in Northern Ireland and exacerbate political tensions and violence there. Ms Mary Harney, leader of the Progressive Democrats, who has been one of Mr Reynolds' sharpest critics, described the declaration as 'fair and balanced'. Mr Prionsias de Rossa, leader of Democratic Left, paid tribute 'to the drafting skills of some of the best brains in both the Irish and British public services'. Mr John Bruton, the Fine Gael leader, congratulated the two prime ministers on reaching an agreement. But he was concerned at a 'lack of clear timetables or mechanisms' for the resumption of inter-party talks and hoped the formula for dropping the republic's constitutional claim to Northern Ireland in the context of an overall settlement 'would not be used as an excuse to defer all action on constitutional reforms into the indeterminate future'. The declaration invited the unionists to suggest topics which 'can be represented as not being fully consistent with a modern democratic and pluralistic society' and offered to discuss and consider 'ways of removing such obstacles'. Mr Bruton warned against establishing too many bodies for discussing issues in the north. On the legislatively powerless Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, which unionists are to be invited to join, he said there should not be 'competing institutions trying to solve the same problem'. Mr Reynolds indicated yesterday, however, that the real objective of such a forum was to provide a further incentive for Sinn Fein to renounce violence.   Countries:-  IEZ  Ireland, EC.

But as the deluge subsides and the waters fall short, we see the dreary steeples of Fermanagh and Tyrone emerging once again. The integrity of their quarrels is one of the few institutions that has been unaltered in the cataclysm which has swept the world.' - Winston Churchill, after the first world war in 1922. John O'Hara, a 42-year-old Roman Catholic taxi driver, did not know he was part of a grotesque overture to historic talks on Northern Ireland's future as he drove to collect a fare in south Belfast last week. Hours earlier loyalist paramilitaries had announced the suspension of 'operational hostilities' once talks started. There was a whiff of hope in the province, as if light had crept beneath the smog of deep sectarian hatred which has engulfed Northern Ireland for generations. But as Mr O'Hara slowed near the Lisburn Road, masked gunmen opened fire. He had become the fifth taxi driver to be murdered in the province in six months, another grim statistic from more than 20 years of the 'Troubles'. Next Tuesday, Mr Peter Brooke, the Northern Ireland secretary, opens a series of round-table talks involving the province's political parties, the Irish and UK governments. Just reaching agreement to talk took more than a year. It will be prefaced with a meeting of British and Irish ministers in London today. For the first time in at least 15 years, political leaders are to sit down and discuss shared problems. The killing will not stop. Men with guns still walk the streets. But given the tortured politics of Northern Ireland, the very fact that political leaders are talking is an achievement in itself. Over the next 10 weeks, conflicting pre-conditions and aspirations will be juggled and rejuggled in the hope that enough of them can be reconciled to secure a lasting settlement. Mr Brooke himself admits the possibility of failure, saying the obstacles to be overcome may be too great 'to be scaled in the limited time-frame we have given ourselves'. He has addressed, in the lexicon of the province's politicians, 'the totality of relationships' within the British Isles. That covers a devolved government in the province itself, relations with the south, and between London and Dublin. Talks will start with bilateral meetings, then move to internal government in the province, before turning to the wider relationships such as the Anglo-Irish axis. At the crux are two basic questions. How, and by whom, is Northern Ireland to be run? And what is its relationship with the rest of the British Isles? Ultimately the test will be whether shared disillusionment across the two communities, allied with political intransigence, will be sufficient to overcome decades of mistrust. But how the agenda will unfold is as clear as Irish mist. Diametrically opposed views have to be accommodated. Many old quarrels have to be forgotten. Northern Ireland remains a black spot of terrorism and unrepresentative government in an increasingly barrier-free Europe. Mr John Hume, leader of the mainly Roman Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party, the Rev Ian Paisley and Mr James Molyneaux, the unionist leaders, have been sparring partners for more than 20 years. Some in Northern Ireland feel progress will come only when the old guard has been replaced. Sinn Fein, the Irish Republican Army's political wing, along with loyalist paramilitaries, has been excluded from the talks - partly because the government is adamant that no concession must be given to terrorists, partly because the main political parties could never be persuaded to sit at the same table. Yet, despite the justifiable qualifications, the latest initiative has, perhaps, a better chance of success than the many plans littering Northern Ireland's recent history. Signs of a change of mood are evident. At least in part, it reflects weariness. In 22 years of 'the Troubles', 2,872 people have been killed in Northern Ireland, the overwhelming majority of them civilians. Dominating the province's recent politics has been the 1985 Anglo-Irish agreement - a pact which, when signed, led to fiery protests by unionists at the prominent role it allotted Dublin in the affairs of the province. Effigies of Mrs Margaret Thatcher were burned outside Belfast City Hall. Unionists refused to meet government ministers. Now unionists are prepared to negotiate. Mr Molyneaux and Mr Paisley have responded to a change of mood among their followers. They realise that many  -particularly the young  - no longer accept the old battle cries of 'no surrender' and 'Dublin rule is Rome rule'. There is an urgency among all parties to solve at least some of Northern Ireland's problems against the backdrop of a Europe striving for greater convergence. The province cannot afford to become fossilised in its ancient quarrels. There must be proper political representation. Attitudes in London, too, are changing. Mr John Major does not have the same convictions about Ulster as Mrs Thatcher, who helped forge the 1985 agreement, only to be taken aback at the scale of protest from unionists - including her own supporters. Subsequently, Mrs Thatcher appeared frustrated with the whole issue, seeing Northern Ireland in terms of security. Mr Major's relative ignorance is almost an asset. His instinct, according to one senior official is, as on Europe, 'to get in there and negotiate'. He is prepared to listen. Although the government in London hopes the talks will help break the cycle of violence, the security dilemma will still exist. There are now more than 16,000 army troops in the province. Army action, including house-to-house searches, alienates munity. Some youths join the paramilitaries just 'to get their own back' on the army. So the roundabout of violence is given another spin. UK government policy is to seek a settlement acceptable to the majority of people. Finances and energies have been directed, since the 1985 agreement, at strengthening community relations and breaking the sectarian divide. Most prominent have been the promotion of integrated schools and highly-interventionist legislation to end discriminatory employment practices. The economy of the province, where unemployment reaches 50 per cent in some pockets, has been pump-primed with billions of Treasury funds - the Northern Ireland Office expects to spend Pounds 6.4bn this financial year. Some successes have been palpable. Ten schools, out of 450 in the province, take both Protestant and Catholic children - compared with just one a decade ago. Jobs have been created in the worst ghettos of Belfast and Londonderry. The new Fair Employment Commission has exposed companies where Protestants or Catholics have a disproportionate share of jobs. But, given the starkness of sectarian division only the edges have been chipped away. Mr Charles Haughey, the Irish Republic's prime minister, has talked of the need 'to chart a new path which will soften and eventually eliminate the divisions of the past on this island'. Dublin is willing to contemplate a new arrangement that would 'transcend' the 1985 pact and, possibly, remove articles two and three from the Irish constitution which lay claim to Northern Ireland. Dublin is aware of changes in its own politics. Half the Irish population is under 28 and does not carry the emotional baggage associated with a united Ireland. A visitor to the republic might be surprised at the public indifference to these talks or to the wider problems of Northern Ireland. But the sub-text of Irish policy is still the achievement of some form of unitary state. Mr Haughey has spoken of the need to persuade 'our unionist countrymen that their future lies with us'. This view is shared by the SDLP. Again, the unionists are seen as the main problem. 'In the SDLP view, the central relationship, the one that goes to the heart of the matter, is the unionist people's relationship with the rest of this island, or rather their distrust of the rest of this island,' says Mr Hume. During her election campaign last year Mrs Mary Robinson, Ireland's president, talked of the need for the republic to 'reach out' to unionists. But while Mrs Robinson might talk of reconciliation, she has few constitutional powers and very little influence on the direction of policy. For their part, the unionists have not rushed to embrace Mrs Robinson. Underlying the unionists' position is an assumption that the Irish Republic's claim on Northern Ireland has to be dropped. From Mr Brooke, they have won an assurance that the province will remain part of the UK as long as a majority of its population want it. After that, unionists seek as top priority renegotiation of the Anglo-Irish agreement, a pact which forced the majority community to realise it could not take sympathetic government from Westminster for granted. Unionists are prepared to contemplate a replacement agreement, insisting that they are committed to good relations with the south. But they argue Ireland's influence must be no more than that of any other 'foreign government'. That leaves scope for textual barter. Giving Dublin the right to be consulted on the affairs of the province would not be acceptable. Dublin currently has the right to put forward its views through the Maryfield secretariat outside Belfast. A right to make representations the British government, with a consulate in Belfast, might succeed. On the question of a devolved government there is more of a muddle. Mr Molyneaux favours a devolved administration fitting 'snugly' into the British parliamentary system - suggesting he wants little more than a enhanced 'county council' system. Mr Paisley backs full-blown legislative devolution along the lines of the former Stormont parliament. He rejects the concept of a 'power-sharing executive', believing it did not work under the 1973 Sunningdale agreement, an early attempt to give the Roman Catholic community a voice in government, and would give disproportionate power to the minority community. But, perhaps influenced by the younger generation within the party, most noticeably Mr Peter Robinson, deputy leader, Mr Paisley's Democratic Unionist party is anxious to look for new schemes for sharing executive responsibility. There is no expectation of a return to strict majority rule. What shape then, in an ideal world, might an agreement take if talks were to succeed? There would almost certainly be a new Northern Ireland 'government', subordinate to Westminster and Dublin, in which the voices of unionism and nationalism were carefully proportioned. The replacement Anglo-Irish agreement would build on a willingness among the peoples of north and south to be 'good neighbours' while accommodating both nationalist and unionist aspirations. It is a tall order indeed. Most critically, any deal will depend on mutual understanding - a sparse commodity in the province. There is no guide to how the talks will evolve over coming weeks. Northern Ireland officials describe them as 'organic'. All parties know they have an opportunity to show progress can be achieved by discussion and not, as the IRA and the loyalist paramilitaries would have it, by violence. It is a high-risk business. If there is no success then the grim and utterly predictable likelihood is more violence.

0,FT934-1777 ,"FT934-1777 _AN-DLQC8ABKFT 931217   FT  17 DEC 93 / London hints at early start to Sinn Fein talks: The government may not wait for weapons to be handed in      By DAVID OWEN and JIMMY BURNS   The government was put on the defensive yesterday after Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, indicated it might enter preliminary dialogue with Sinn Fein without waiting for the IRA to hand in its weapons. His remarks dismayed some Tory backbenchers, with one MP accusing the government of giving in to the terrorists. Downing Street said the government had made a non-negotiable demand that Provisional IRA leaders end violence for good; those concerned should accept that they had 'no need for weapons'. Downing Street also signalled that a secret message sent to the Provisionals on November 5 and made public later in the month gave an indication of subjects the government would be prepared to address in exploratory meetings. One subject that might be discussed was the restriction on broadcasting direct speech by members of terrorist organisations in the province and their apologists. Mr Peter Brooke, national heritage secretary, is expected to report on a review of the restrictions to the prime minister early next year. Officials acknowledged that while there was no question of an amnesty for IRA prisoners, the sentence of any prisoner could be reviewed under normal procedures which took account of whether criminals were likely to reoffend. The November 5 message set out three purposes for the exploratory dialogue that the government originally proposed entering into in January, in return for a permanent end to IRA violence. These were: To explore the basis upon which Sinn Fein would come to be admitted to an 'inclusive political talks process'. To exchange views on how Sinn Fein would be able over a period to play the same part as the present constitutional parties in the public life of Northern Ireland. To examine the practical consequences of the ending of violence. For the first meeting of exploratory dialogue it was proposed that each party could field up to three delegates plus possibly an additional group of advisers. The British side was to be represented by 'senior officials' acting under 'political authority and direction'. Interviewed on BBC Radio Ulster, Sir Patrick said: 'At exploratory talks it would be highly relevant as to when and how arms should be surrendered. You cannot be sitting on top of arms and at the same time saying you are for real when you say that violence is at an end.' Separately, he signalled the government would not automatically say any deal with Sinn Fein was off if one bomb exploded during the interim three months. 'If there is a bomb that goes off somewhere, that will count very heavily against their credibility, but it is very important not to be tied down here and now to precise circumstances when we do not know what they are going to be,' he said. Mr David Wilshire, Tory MP for Spelthorne, said he was 'appalled and alarmed' at the prospect that the government did not expect the IRA to hand over arms until the talks started. 'This means we have just given in to the terrorists. I had a sense that this was too good to be true. We are beginning to see some of the detail - and I don't like it,' he said. Security sources in Northern Ireland said yesterday that an extended ceasefire by the IRA would be matched by a phased reduction of the Army and police presence. Army commanders and senior Royal Ulster Constabulary officers are understood to hold in reserve a contingency plan drafted in the event of an IRA ceasefire lasting well beyond the traditional three or four-day Christmas lull. The sources insist that there would be no immediate return to barracks. But measures including an end to security barriers in city centres and a reduction in Army and police checkpoints would be taken 'within weeks'. A senior Northern Ireland source who has acted as a channel of communication in the past between the IRA and government officials said that Sinn Fein officials were finding it difficult to persuade sectors of the IRA that the joint declaration represented the best possible solution for the nationalist community.

0,FT934-11481 ,"FT934-11481 _AN-DJ4AOABLFT 931030   FT  30 OCT 93 / Leaders set out Ulster principles      By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor   MR JOHN MAJOR and Mr Albert Reynolds, the British and Irish Republic prime ministers, last night set out six guiding principles as they sought to revive the momentum for a political settlement in Northern Ireland. For the first time Mr Major spelled out explicitly that his government would be willing to bring Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, into peace negotiations. He was adamant that this would be possible only if the IRA renounced permanently the use of violence and demonstrated over 'a period' its commitment never to return to terrorism. As both leaders acknowledged the growing pressure on London and Dublin - and on the constitutional parties in Ulster - to fill the political vacuum, they said in a joint communique that the first principle of any settlement was: 'The situation in Northern Ireland should never be changed by violence or the threat of violence.' They added: 'Any political settlement must depend on consent freely given in the absence of force or intimidation.' Negotiations could only take place between governments and parties committed exclusively to constitutional methods. There could be no talks or negotiations between their governments and 'those who use, threaten or support violence for political ends'. The two leaders then reinforced that condition by stressing that there would be no agreements with organisations supporting violence. All parties claiming a serious interest in advancing the cause of peace in Ireland should renounce the support for violence. But in language that reflected the Dublin government's view that the republican paramilitaries must be persuaded to stop the fighting, the communique added: 'If and when such a renunciation of violence had been made and sufficiently demonstrated, new doors could open, and both governments would want to respond imaginatively to the new situation which would arise.' Pledging to press ahead with their own efforts to secure negotiations between the constitutional parties in Northern Ireland, Mr Major and Mr Reynolds added that the two governments would work together on a new 'framework for peace, stability and reconciliation'. They added that such an initiative could only be taken by the two governments. London and Dublin acknowledged the 'courageous efforts' of Mr John Hume, the leader of the mainly Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party. But there was 'no question' of the report he had drawn up after his talks with Mr Gerry Adams, the leader of Sinn Fein, being adopted or endorsed. Last night Sinn Fein was non-committal on the statement by the two prime ministers, saying only that leaders of the party were planning to study it in detail over the weekend.

0,FT944-2612 ,"FT944-2612 _AN-ELPB8AAPFT 941216   FT  16 DEC 94 / Calm hand at helm of uneasy coalition: The challenges facing John Bruton as Ireland's new premier      by JOHN MURRAY BROWN   Mr John Bruton was once described as 'John Unionist' by Mr Albert Reynolds, the man he succeeded yesterday as Ireland's new prime minister. It was an unfortunate slip of the tongue. Nonetheless, the inadvertent allusion to Mr Bruton's views on Northern Ireland highlights one of the key differences in government policy likely to emerge with his accession yesterday as head of a three-party coalition between his Fine Gael party, Labour and the small Democratic Left. The feeling in Dublin last night was one of relief after a month of deliberations and allegations, which had left Ireland in the hands of a caretaker administration since the collapse of the Fianna Fail-Labour coalition after a judicial appointment row. The delay had cast an ill-timed shadow over the Northern Ireland peace process, straining relations between Dublin and Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, and halting negotiations on the joint framework document which Ireland and the UK hope will form the basis for all-party talks on Ulster's constitutional future. Ireland still faces a hectic diplomatic agenda, with Dublin due to host the European Union's 1996 intergovernmental conference. Some analysts yesterday predicted the coalition might not survive that long. The potential for discord within such a wide-ranging coalition is clear. Fianna Fail, licking its wounds on the opposition benches, is in no mood to be forgiving. Mr Bruton's Fine Gael is a rural-based conservative party with largely middle class support which has lost votes to Mr Dick Spring's more urban Labour party. Meanwhile, Mr Proinsias De Rossa's Democratic Left is an old-fashioned socialist party and the successor of the Official IRA, when the Provisional IRA broke away to pursue the armed struggle in 1970. Even at the last minute yesterday, Democratic Left looked set to pull out of negotiations once it became clear the party, which has just six seats in the Dail, was being offered a single cabinet portfolio. Last night the single overriding preoccupation of all the parties seemed to be a determination to see Fianna Fail consigned to the opposition. In Mr Bruton, the government will have calm if uncharismatic leadership. A former finance minister, he is a plain speaking barrister with 20 years in the Dail and a wealth of ministerial experience. Politically he is said to be close to the rural wing of the party, identified with Mr Liam Cosgrave, a former prime minister. In February Mr Bruton rode out a leadership challenge, and still could be vulnerable to attack from the liberal wing of the party associated with another former premier, Dr Garret Fitzgerald. Mr Bruton likes to dub Fine Gael as 'part of the great European Christian Democrat movement'. He campaigned in favour of divorce reform, where there will be a meeting of minds with Labour and Democratic Left. On the North, the strains may be difficult to hide. Fine Gael is historically identified as the party which voted for the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921, which created partition. As a believer in a more accommodating stance towards the Unionists, Mr Bruton is likely to push for reform of Articles 2 and 3 of the constitution, which enshrine Ireland's territorial claim to Northern Ireland. London in particular is keen to see that Fianna Fail, which has played a key role in the peace process so far, should not now be isolated. The party, as the voice of constitutional republicanism (Fianna Fail voted against the Treaty) enjoys better relations with Sinn Fein than the other parties. As a result, Fianna Fail's support could be critical if the coalition is to steer through constitutional reform, which would have to be put to a referendum. On the economy, the coalition's problems are perhaps more acute. Mr Bruton is sometimes described as Thatcherite on economic policy and he certainly won a reputation for tight spending policies when in charge of finance in 1982 after the profligate years of Mr Charles Haughey's Fianna Fail government. Any attempt by Fine Gael to cut taxes and reduce public spending is likely to be resisted by Labour and Democratic Left.  The Financial Times   London Page 2  "

The regiment was formed, out of 'Options for Change' by an amalgamation of the Royal Irish Rangers and the Ulster Defence Regiment, the former being a conventional line infantry regiment, the latter being deployed in Northern Ireland. It has long been a tradition of the Royal Irish Rangers, inherited from their predecessors, the Irish Regiments, to recruit from both Northern Ireland and the republic with no religious discrimination, as can be seen from the number of Catholic commanding officers they have had: this attitude is already spreading within the whole recently constituted regiment. There is now a service battalion which takes its place in the line as a regular army unit, currently deployed in the eastern Mediterranean, and six home battalions in Northern Ireland. I feel that, by trying to simplify matters, Clark might have unwittingly traduced one example of real integration.

The talks are expected to be on February 19 when Mr Albert Reynolds will be in London for the England-Ireland rugby international. The meeting follows the refusal of Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein leader, to indicate during his controversial New York visit that the IRA was prepared to renounce its campaign of violence. Growing pessimism in London about the prospects of an early end to IRA terrorism in response to December's Downing Street declaration prompted Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, to announce last week that he would table fresh ideas for a political settlement between Ulster's constitutional parties. Sir Patrick's announcement caused irritation in Dublin. The Irish government had indicated privately to London that it would prefer such negotiations to remain on hold until after Sinn Fein's party conference at the end of the month. Last night Mr Reynolds increased pressure on Sinn Fein to give a response to the call for peace. He said time was running out for a response and he expected either acceptance or rejection of the declaration by the time of the party conference. He told a meeting of the Fianna Fail party in Dublin that he had provided 'copious clarification' of the document in response to requests from Mr Adams. Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, said that political talks on Northern Ireland will go ahead 'with or without Sinn Fein'. In spite of Britain's determination to press ahead with constitutional talks Mr John Major is anxious that there should be no rift with Mr Reynolds because the process depends on maintaining the united front established by the Downing Street declaration. Mr Major is expected to reassure Mr Reynolds that Britain is not aiming for a 'minimalist' political settlement which would involve no more than the establishment of devolved government in Ulster. That option is being pressed hard by the Ulster Unionist party. But British ministers recognise that the the mainly Roman Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party will not accept the creation of a new assembly unless there is an overall agreement encompassing north-south relations and links between London and Dublin. Mr Major will tell Mr Reynolds that he wants to push ahead with this 'three-stranded' approach. He will also make it clear that the search for a political settlement would not preclude a place at the table for Sinn Fein if the IRA did end its terrorist campaign.

He said the issue would not be resolved in bilateral meetings between the government and his party. On the eve of a second session of exploratory talks in Belfast between the two sides, at which the issue of guns and explosives is likely to be raised again, he said the process of demilitarisation could be addressed once the talks moved to all-inclusive dialogue involving all the parties. Mr Major has insisted that the IRA must give up its weapons before Sinn Fein can enter full negotiations on the future of Ulster. The Irish Republic's government is anxious not to let the issue delay the peace process. Mr John Bruton, the new prime minister, said yesterday: 'It is important to resolve this, not to get into a stand-off about it.' Mr Adams said the existence of all armed groups, including the army and loyalists, needed to be resolved by an effective demilitarisation process as part of the overall settlement. Meanwhile, the republic's new coalition government was yesterday embroiled in an immediate controversy after Mr Albert Reynolds, the outgoing prime minister, revealed details of confidential negotiations between London and Dublin on the Northern Ireland peace process. His comments drew criticism from the UK government, unionist MPs and politicians in the republic. Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, expressed surprise that Mr Reynolds should breach the confidentiality of the negotiations and said it would 'make things difficult for both sides'. Mr Reynolds, interviewed on BBC Radio at the weekend, said London had agreed that Dublin should have a role in future all-Ireland institutions covering areas such as tourism and transport - a move northern unionists believe is a step towards a united Ireland. The former Irish prime minister, forced to resign over a judicial appointment scandal last month, said an all-Ireland body would have executive powers and be drawn from representatives in Dublin and a future parliament in Northern Ireland. Mr Reynolds said substantive talks involving British ministers and Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, should begin now and troops should be taken off the streets. He said Downing Street's precondition that weapons be handed in or destroyed could seriously threaten the ceasefire. Mr Reynolds said the all-Ireland body was among proposals in a new framework document which London and Dublin hoped would form the basis for all-party talks on the province's future. The document is due to be published early next year and is expected to be discussed when Mr Major meets Mr Bruton next week.   Countries:-  IEZ  Ireland, EC.     GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

0,FT934-5602 ,"FT934-5602 _AN-DK2DYAECFT 931129   FT  29 NOV 93 / Ulster peace efforts in turmoil: Government accused of lying over IRA dialogue - PM backs Mayhew      By PHILIP STEPHENS and TIM COONE      LONDON, DUBLIN   Mr John Major's government was last night struggling to salvage efforts to restore peace to Northern Ireland after a damaging admission that it had been in prolonged contact with the IRA. Amid a storm of criticism from hard-line Unionists and accusations of duplicity from opposition parties, Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, said he would make a full House of Commons statement later today on the contacts. The dialogue, stretching back to February and including an exchange as late as November 5, marks the most intensive dealings between the British government and the IRA for at least a decade. But its disclosure cast a shadow over prospects for Mr Major's forthcoming summit meeting with Mr Albert Rey-nolds, the Irish prime minister. The summit is still pencilled in for this Friday but there were doubts in Whitehall last night about whether, in the wake of the disclosures, the two leaders could make a breakthrough in their search for a political settlement. Mr Major gave firm backing to Sir Patrick's insistence that a series of messages passed through an intermediary to Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, had not amounted to negotiating with terrorists. Downing Street said there was no question of the Northern Ireland secretary being forced to resign in the wake of the meetings - at least three, in March, August and November - between the unnamed intermediary and Sinn Fein representatives. It would have been 'irresponsible' not to respond to such overtures. But ministers admitted privately that the weekend disclosures sat uneasily with the repeated and vigorous denials in recent weeks from Mr Major and Sir Patrick that there had been negotiations or 'talks' with the IRA. There was also acknowledgment that the affair might have severely damaged hopes of bringing the provinces's Unionists into talks on a new political settlement. The Reverend William McCrea, the Democratic Unionist MP for Mid-Ulster, who made public documents confirming the contacts, said that Mr Major had been telling direct lies at a meeting last week between the two of them and the Reverend Ian Paisley, the DUP leader. Reaction from the Ulster Unionists, however, was significantly more restrained, with the party's MPs saying they would wait for Sir Patrick's full statement before taking a definite position. Sir Patrick said yesterday no civil servants had been involved in 'authorised' contacts with Sinn Fein through a 'chain' established several years ago when Baroness Thatcher was prime minister. The latest process had begun in February with an approach from the IRA suggesting it wanted advice on ending its armed campaign, he said. Sir Patrick told a hastily-convened press conference in Belfast that: 'I do not believe had I made no response, had the government made no response, that if subsequent bombs were exploded and life taken and people injured - as indeed was the case - I would have been readily forgiven by the people of Northern Ireland.' That version of events was flatly denied by Mr Gerry Adams, the president of Sinn Fein, who accused Sir Patrick of 'lying'. Mr Adams said there had been no communication from the IRA saying that the conflict had ended. Mr Martin McGuinness, the prominent Sinn Fein leader with whom the messages were exchanged, said high-level contacts were continuing with the full knowledge of the prime minister. As the government embarked on a desperate damage limitation exercise, Sir Patrick said it would publish in full both the documents sent to Sinn Fein and those transmitted by the IRA to London. In an attempt to reassure the mainstream Ulster Unionists led by Mr James Molyneaux, Sir Patrick insisted that at no time had the government dropped its condition that there could be no negotiations until the IRA brought its terrorist campaign to a permanent end. It is understood, however, that the documents include an explicit offer of a place in negotiations for Sinn Fein if the IRA ceases its campaign  - an offer made public by Mr Major when he met Mr Reynolds in Brussels last month. They also carried the suggestion that a dialogue could begin even if an end to the conflict was not publicly declared. Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, said the government's credibility was at stake after what had been at best 'stupidity' and at worst 'duplicity'.

0,FT922-12560 ,"FT922-12560 _AN-CDPBOAE8FT 920416   FT  16 APR 92 / Prime minister plays a long game: The strategy behind the ministerial appointments      By RALPH ATKINS   MR JOHN Major has tried to play a long game in selecting his ministerial team below cabinet rank. The prime minister has looked to pre-empt disgruntlement among Conservative parliamentary ranks across a four or five year parliament. A fourth election victory could easily turn to irritability or complacency among backbenchers. Consulting closely with Mr Richard Ryder, the chief whip, Mr Major has promoted ministers he believes might yet become cabinet material. Mr Major believes that stamping his own mark on the government, to replace that of Mrs Margaret Thatcher, is an evolving process that still has some way to go. The selection is nevertheless somewhat eclectic. Fellow cricket fans like Mr Robert Atkins, moved by Mr Major to become minister of state at the Northern Ireland Office, have survived against expectations. Mr Nicholas Soames, who few expected to see in ministerial office, has started on the junior ranks at agriculture. The biggest change in direction is likely from the expanded Department of Trade and Industry team under Mr Michael Heseltine. Industry policy will become the immediate responsibility of Mr Tim Sainsbury, the cautious former parliamentary private secretary to Mr Heseltine. Export promotion falls to another Heseltine admirer, the affable and energetic Mr Richard Needham, promoted from the Northern Ireland Office. Mr Tim Eggar will take the DTI's new responsibilities for energy policy. Another theme is the pre-eminence of the Treasury - reflected also in the trading yesterday of senior civil servants between the Treasury and 10 Downing Street. Mr Stephen Dorrell, the 40-year-old new financial secretary to the Treasury, is regarded as highly able and a potential cabinet minister. Mr Anthony Nelson, the new economic secretary, will enhance the job by taking in the Treasury's new responsibilities for the financial services industry. Elsewhere Mr Major has followed an almost textbook course of balancing right and left within his party. He has Thatcherite No Turning Back Group supporters in his cabinet. In lower ranks he has Mr John Redwood, the new environment minister, Mr Eric Forth, junior education minister, and Mr Michael Forsyth, employment minister. At the same time he appointed Mr Robert Hughes to the government whips office. Mr Hughes was a parliamentary private secretary to former Tory prime minister Mr Edward Heath. Mr Major has offered some of the new entrants a government post when they must have thought they had become confirmed backbenchers. Mr Michael Mates, the Northern Ireland Office minister and former campaign manager of Mr Heseltine, had been passed over many times before. Mr Nigel Forman, junior education minister, has been brought in from the cold after being parliamentary private secretary to Mr Nigel Lawson, the former chancellor blamed by many Tories for mismanaging the economy. The official explanation is that Mr Major wanted to tap talent from across the party. But it also reduces the number of long-standing backbenchers harbouring resentment for being overlooked. For bright entrants or relative newcomers there remains the prospect of promotion as ministers who fail to make the grade are pulled out.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- THE NEW GOVERNMENT IN FULL  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- THE CABINET:  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Prime Minister, First Lord of the Treasury and Minister for the Civil Service: John Major, 49                 salary pounds  76,234 Lord Chancellor: Lord Mackay of Clashfern, 64          pounds 106,750 Foreign Secretary: Douglas Hurd, 62                      pounds  63,047 Chancellor of the Exchequer: Norman Lamont, 49                     pounds  63,047 Home Secretary: Kenneth Clarke, 51                    pounds  63,047 Trade and Industry Secretary: Michael Heseltine, 59                 pounds  63,047 Transport Secretary: John McGregor, 55                     pounds  63,047 Defence Secretary: Malcolm Rifkind, 45                   pounds  63,047 Lord Privy Seal and Leader of the House of Lords: John Wakeham, 59                      pounds  50,558 Lord President of the Council and Leader of the House of Commons: Tony Newton, 54                       pounds  63,047 Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food: John Gummer, 52                       pounds  63,047 Environment Secretary: Michael Howard, 50                    pounds  63,047 Welsh Secretary: David Hunt, 49                        pounds  63,047 Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster: William Waldegrave, 45                pounds  63,047 Scottish Secretary: Ian Lang, 51                          pounds  63,047 Secretary of State for National Heritage: David Mellor, 43                      pounds  63,047 Northern Ireland Secretary: Sir Patrick Mayhew, 62                pounds  63,047 Education Secretary: John Patten, 46                       pounds  63,047 Health Secretary: Virginia Bottomley, 44                pounds  63,047 Employment Secretary: Gillian Shephard, 52                  pounds  63,047 Chief Secretary to the Treasury: Michael Portillo, 38                  pounds  63,047  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- MINISTRIES:  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food: Minister - David Curry.

0,FT922-7886 ,"FT922-7886 _AN-CEOAZAFCFT 920515   FT  15 MAY 92 / South bears brunt of big increase in unemployment: More defence industry jobs lost      By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff   THE BRUNT of April's sharp rise in unemployment was borne by the southern regions of the UK, although the number of people out of work rose in all parts of the country except Northern Ireland. The rise was sharpest in the south-west, where a 0.3 per cent monthly increase in the number of jobless brought the total to 201,800. In the south-east, including London, unemployment rose by 0.1 per cent, bringing the rate of unemployment to 10.2 per cent. There were also sharp increases in the west Midlands and north-west, but economists suggested yesterday that the southern half of the country would continue to suffer the biggest monthly increases in unemployment as pressure on the service sector persis-ted. In Northern Ireland the level of unemployment remained unchanged in April compared with the previous month. Nevertheless, the rate of unemployment - at 14.3 per cent - remained the highest in the country. The overall weakness of the labour market was further reflected in a rise in the rate of male unemployment to 12.8 per cent from 10.1 per cent a year ago. Female unemployment remained significantly lower, rising to 5.2 per cent in April compared with 4.4 per cent a year ago. The level of female unemployment, and consequently overall unemployment, may be much higher, since many married women whose husbands work are not eligible for benefits and hence do not show up in the figures. Job vacancy statistics worsened with the number of unfilled vacancies, which account for about a third of all vacancies in the economy, falling by 7,900 to 119,600 - 2,200 fewer vacancies than in April last year. The Department of Employment said that over the past six months Jobcentre vacancies had risen by 2,700 a month on average. Employment in the manufacturing sector continued to decline. The number of employees in manufacturing in the UK fell to 4.5m, a fall of 26,000 on the month. Employment in the sector has fallen by 297,000 in the year to March, compared with a fall of 239,000 in the previous year. Measured on a quarterly basis, an improving trend in manufacturing employment was reversed in the three months to March. In the third and fourth quarters of last year manufacturing employment fell by 65,000 and 59,000 respectively compared with a fall of 101,000 in the second quarter. In the latest three months, employment in manufacturing industries fell by 72,000.  The Financial Times   London Page 9  "

The visa will allow him to launch a media blitz on behalf of  the republican cause but not to raise funds.    Officials said Mr Adams will be allowed to stay only 48  hours, be barred from travelling more than 25 miles from New  York and not allowed to engage in ""direct or indirect fund  raising.""    The ostensible purpose of his trip is to attend a conference  of the National Committee on American Foreign Policy, a  non-profit group whose honorary chairman is the former secretary  of state Henry Kissinger.    Some members of Congress opposed the visa as a dangerous  concession that could only result in political comfort for the  IRA. The U.S. decision followed a statement in which Mr Adams  declared himself to be against all forms of violence in Northern  Ireland, ""including the violence of the British army and  security forces,"" and said he looked forward to the disbandment  of the IRA.    Mr Adams has been repeatedly denied admission to the United  States over the past 20 years on grounds of his alleged  involvement in terrorism.    Ulster Unionists and Conservative backbenchers will be  concerned that American-Irish politicians will give him a  publicity platform and effectively condone terrorism.    The British Government said that Sinn Fein would be judged  by  deeds, not words. A spokesman said: ""The fact is that Adams  said in a statement that he wants to end violence and is working  towards supporting the Downing Street declaration, and it is on  that basis that he is being admitted, under very strict  conditions for 48 hours. The British Government does not issue  visas for admission to the U.S.""    Labour's Northern Ireland spokesman, Kevin McNamara, said:  ""We are against exclusion orders in principle. It is purely an  internal domestic matter for the United States Government, and I  have no views about it.""    Ken Maginnis, Ulster Unionist MP for Fermanagh and South  Tyrone, who refused to go to the same conference if Mr Adams was  there, said last night: ""My understanding was that two  conditions were being imposed on Mr Adams, firstly that he  accepted the Downing Street declaration and secondly that the  IRA would cease violence. I cannot believe that he has accepted  either of those.""    Sammy Wilson, spokesman for the hardline Democratic Unionist  Party, last night deplored the U.S. decision. ""It's quite clear  since the declaration was signed on December 15 that the payoff  for the IRA was coming. They've had their secret talks with the  British Government, the broadcasting ban in the Irish Republic  has been lifted and even the Americans are in the payoff too by  giving their terrorist leader a plafform.""    The conference will give Mr Adams the opportunity to  reinvigorate the U.S. support for Sinn Fein, and to appear on as  many U.S. TV news and talkshows as he can squeeze in.    The Clinton administration had said last week that its  decision would depend on a statement of Mr Adams's views on  violence and his readiness to support the peace efforts of John  Major and the Irish Government.    British officials in Washington last night were putting the  best face on their defeat, suggesting that if Mr Adams lived up  to his statement, Northern Ireland would benefit. If he did  not, the U.S. Government would learn its lesson, and Sinn Fein  would lose credibility.    President Clinton was under strong pressure from congressmen  with influential Irish-American constituencies. Democratic  senators Teddy Kennedy of Massachusetts, who faces a difficult  re-election battle this year, and Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New  York, whose chairmanship of the finance commitee gives him a  near-stranglehold on Mr Clinton's domestic agenda, had both  urged that the visa be granted.    Before the announcement from Washington, Mr Adams had denied  he had renounced violence as a condition of getting the visa. He  said in Dublin that he had had ""a very interesting exchange of  views"" with a senior U.S. official which showed that the Clinton  administration was acquainting itself with the republican  position.    The Irish Government remained aloof from the controversy  sticking to its formal line that it was entirely a matter for  Washington. It is believed to have cautioned the Americans  against allowing Mr Adams too much latitude.     "

By SHAWN POGATCHNIK, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES      BELFAST, Northern Ireland      The Irish Republican Army executed its most deadly attacks on British forces in  two years Wednesday, forcing civilians to deliver car bombs that killed six  soldiers in nearly simultaneous incidents at two border checkpoints. One  civilian also died and at least 20 people were wounded, officials said.    According to the widow of the civilian victim, Patsy Gillespie, he was ordered  by IRA gunmen to drive a car packed with an estimated 1,000 pounds of  explosives into the Londonderry border post about 4 a.m. Gillespie and five  soldiers were killed, and 10 people were injured.    About 15 minutes later, a van exploded at a checkpoint south of Newry, although  the driver, a 65-year-old man whose family was being held hostage by the IRA,  was able to shout a warning before the bomb went off. One soldier died and 10  others were wounded in that incident.    The driver at Newry suffered a broken leg as he dashed from the car seconds  before it blew up.    The blasts at opposite ends of the province were believed to be in retaliation  for the fatal shooting two weeks ago of Dessie Grew, a leading IRA gunman  suspected of several killings in Northern Ireland and Europe.    The day's violence could have been even worse. A third car bomb, piloted by a  man who had been beaten and tied to the driver's seat, failed to explode fully  outside a police station in Omagh, about midway between the sites of the two  other blasts.    All three coerced drivers apparently were targeted by the IRA because they  worked in British security installations -- an IRA tactic, in effect, to kill  two birds with one stone.

By SHAWN POGATCHNIK, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES      BELFAST, Northern Ireland      The Irish Republican Army executed its most deadly attacks on British forces in  two years Wednesday, forcing civilians to deliver car bombs that killed six  soldiers in nearly simultaneous incidents at two border checkpoints. One  civilian also died and at least 20 people were wounded, officials said.    According to the widow of the civilian victim, Patsy Gillespie, he was ordered  by IRA gunmen to drive a car packed with an estimated 1,000 pounds of  explosives into the Londonderry border post about 4 a.m. Gillespie and five  soldiers were killed, and 10 people were injured.    About 15 minutes later, a van exploded at a checkpoint south of Newry, although  the driver, a 65-year-old man whose family was being held hostage by the IRA,  was able to shout a warning before the bomb went off. One soldier died and 10  others were wounded in that incident.    The driver at Newry suffered a broken leg as he dashed from the car seconds  before it blew up.    The blasts at opposite ends of the province were believed to be in retaliation  for the fatal shooting two weeks ago of Dessie Grew, a leading IRA gunman  suspected of several killings in Northern Ireland and Europe.    The day's violence could have been even worse. A third car bomb, piloted by a  man who had been beaten and tied to the driver's seat, failed to explode fully  outside a police station in Omagh, about midway between the sites of the two  other blasts.    All three coerced drivers apparently were targeted by the IRA because they  worked in British security installations -- an IRA tactic, in effect, to kill  two birds with one stone.

0,FT941-12823 ,"FT941-12823 _AN-EA1CHACDFT 940128   FT  28 JAN 94 / US urged to keep ban on Adams      By DAVID OWEN and MICHAEL CASSELL   The government last night sent a clear signal to Washington that any decision to lift its ban on Mr Gerry Adams entering the US would be unwelcome, unless the Sinn Fein president renounced violence. In comments made less than 48 hours before a decision on the ban is due, Downing Street said it hoped a visa would not be given to Mr Adams unless he made 'a clear and unequivocal renunciation of violence'. It was 'deeds not words' that were required. It said the government had been in talks with the US on the subject. The signal came as the IRA left fire bombs at three stores in London. Yesterday also saw two sectarian murders in Ulster. The attacks came on the eve of the first session of the Anglo-Irish inter-governmental conference since the two governments unveiled their joint peace initiative in December. The conference is likely to provide the opportunity for both governments to reaffirm their joint position on the peace initiative. A display of unity over the progress of the political talks co-ordinated by Mr Michael Ancram, the Northern Ireland minister, may be harder to engineer. London has indicated that it intends to act, as promised, to give focus to the talks fairly soon, although this may come in bilateral and private sessions. Dublin is anxious not to divert attention from the peace process. Mr Adams recently applied for a visa at the American Embassy in Dublin after receiving an invitation to attend a conference in New York on Monday. Under US immigration law, he is still officially ineligible for a visa but a waiver can be issued by the attorney general on recommendation from Mr Warren Christopher, the secretary of state. It is understood that President Bill Clinton has been involved in the decision-making process and that a series of meetings took place in Washington on Wednesday. A number of Irish-American politicians have lobbied on Mr Adams' behalf. The leaders of the Ulster Unionists and the hardline Democratic Unionist party have already declined an invitation to attend the conference. Mr John Hume, leader of the mainly Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party, and Dr John Alderdice, leader of the Alliance party, are expected to attend. Unionist politicians and leaders of loyalist terrorist groups in Northern Ireland have met to discuss the Downing Street declaration, according to the BBC television programme Spotlight, which is shown only in Northern Ireland. According to the programme, the paramilitaries, represented by the combined loyalist military command have been seeking clarification of the opposing views on the declaration taken by the Democratic Unionist and Ulster Unionist parties.

London's carefully worded text, which followed detailed consultations between senior ministers including Mr John Major, the prime minister, answered just one of the 20 questions directly, confirming that, if necessary, a referendum would be held to establish the wishes of the Northern Irish people concerning the province's future. It said the rest of Sinn Fein's questions 'range much more widely' than seeking elucidation of the test of the joint UK-Irish declaration. London's response was warmly welcomed as 'comprehensive and positive' by Dublin. Sinn Fein said it would examine the government's comments and reply to them later. Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, said later that the remaining questions 'to some extent were invitations to negotiate', but London was 'not going to negotiate, that is made very clear'. By answering one of the questions and hence modifying its previous insistence that the declaration did not need clarifying, London appeared to be trying to encourage republican doves, giving them grounds for proclaiming the exercise a success. But ministers will hope to have reassured unionists and Conservative backbenchers with its punctilious refusal to be drawn into negotiations. Earlier this week, Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, sought to portray the government's decision to respond at all as a victory, saying it was 'gratifying' that people had now accepted clarification was needed. Asked last night why the government had decided against leaving the questions unanswered, Sir Patrick said he thought people would have been 'rather critical' of such a decision. He added: 'We are facing something of great seriousness.' This was the continuation of political violence when both the British and Irish governments had agreed that the future should be decided by consent. Praising London's response as 'comprehensive and positive', Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, said it should 'help to clear the road'. He was supported by Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, who said that London had made 'a very serious effort' to meet the concerns of Sinn Fein. 'Sinn Fein should be able to welcome it . . . We feel very strongly that this effort by the British government should end the logjam.' Lord Holme, the Liberal Democrat Northern Ireland spokesman, urged the IRA to declare an immediate ceasefire. 'The IRA has seriously misjudged the mood in Britain and the Irish Republic,' he said. 'Their support deserves to dwindle even further if they procrastinate another day.'

0,FT922-12808 ,"FT922-12808 _AN-CDOBJAEWFT 920415   FT  15 APR 92 / Non-Cabinet appointments   Richard Needham THE NEW trade and industry minister, is a chirpy and interventionist Tory likely to fit comfortably in a department headed by Mr Michael Heseltine. In his previous job as Northern Ireland's economy minister, Mr Needham believed in taking a pro-active role in encouraging investment. Aged 50, he holds the record for continuous service at the Northern Ireland Office  - a testimony as much to the unease with which he fitted into Mrs Margaret Thatcher's government as to his dedication to Ulster. At times he survived only by luck. His biggest claim to fame came after terrorists intercepted a telephone conversation about Mrs Margaret Thatcher in which he wished 'the silly cow would resign'. A few months later she did. Mr Needham is witty, sometimes a show off and frequently a tease, annoying his staff by running behind schedule. He can be over-sensitive and unable to summon sufficient political brutality to push ideas through into practice. He succeeded in uniting nationalist and Unionist politicians in Northern Ireland against his plans for privatising the province's electricity industry. Anthony Nelson MR NELSON, who has been appointed economic secretary to the Treasury, used his detailed knowledge of the working of the City to press for the more effective regulation of the financial services sector during the passage of the legislation which established the Securities and Investments Board. Mr Nelson, MP for Chichester since October 1974, led the final stage of the campaign for televising the Commons. A frequent participant in finance bill debates and a staunch advocate of Britain's membership of the European Community, Mr Nelson will bring panache and style to the Treasury team. He was a merchant banker with NM Rothschild before entering the Commons and was one of Mrs Virginia Bottomley's 'political minders' when she won the South West Surrey by-election in 1984. Mr Nelson was one of the backbenchers who successfully pressed Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, to take action in his pre-election budget to freeze the transitional element in the uniform business rate by ensuring that the increase in 1992-93 did not exceed the rate of inflation. Stephen Dorrell THE incoming financial secretary to the Treasury, who steps up from junior health minister, was secretary of the Conservative backbench Treasury committee from 1980 to 1982. He became identified with the 'wet' wing of the Conservative party at the age of 22 when acting as personal assistant to Mr Peter Walker in the general election held in February 1974. After capturing Loughborough to become the youngest member of the Commons in 1979, Mr Dorrell served as secretary to the Conservative backbench trade and industry committee before becoming a parliamentary private secretary and serving in the whips office. Mr Dorrell demonstrated combative qualities when appointed junior health minister in 1990. He championed the NHS reforms, and his robust denials of Labour's claims that the NHS was being privatised impressed senior colleagues. Early associations with 'one nation' Toryism handicapped Mr Dorrell during the Thatcher years when he was described as 'excessively moderate' by Mr Julian Critchley, the sage of the Tory backbenches. In Major's era his political roots should prove a developing asset. Sir John Cope SIR JOHN has earned his reward for his time spent overseeing Tory party finances with his appointment as Treasury minister. The former deputy chairman of the Conservative party is a popular, genial MP, specialising in small behind-the-scenes triumphs. Although Central Office does not publish its detailed accounts, Sir John appears to have gone some way towards reversing the fall-off in donations to the Conservative party. Aged 54, Sir John is an unassuming figure likely to suit an important, but relatively low-profile, job. He does not have political panache, an excessive appetite for publicity, or the clout of a heavyweight. But he has a warmth and intelligence that makes him able to work effectively as part of a team. He also has business acumen from a background as a chartered accountant and past company directorships. In his political life he has paid particular interest to the needs of small businesses. His past incarnations include a respected tenure as deputy chief whip and a less impressive period as Northern Ireland security minister. He has also been an employment minister. Tim Eggar IT IS an indication of how obscure Mr Tim Eggar's progress through the ministerial ranks to his new appointment at the Department of Trade and Industry that he is perhaps best known for an altercation, more than two years ago, after he caught a six-year-old girl taking flowers from his garden. That incident led to the girl's father being convicted of assaulting Mr Eggar, but the judge also criticised the then employment minister's behaviour. While this incident may have reinforced his pugnacious reputation, he is also tough and determined. Having been selected as prospective parliamentary candidate for Enfield North at the age of 23 in October 1975, he spent three nights a week and most weekends there for the next three years, familiarising himself with constituents' concerns. In July, he will complete three years as a minister, first at employment, then at education under Mr Kenneth Clarke, now at Mr Michael Heseltine's DTI. An advocate of privatisation throughout the 1980s, he has been credited with engineering the change in Tory thinking in favour of vocational education. Jonathan Aitken Although a deeply ingrained Euro-sceptic, Mr Jonathan Aitken,the new minister of state for defence, made a timely decision not to vote against thegovernment in the most recent division in the Commons on the European Community Budget. He also lavished praise on Mr John Major,the prime minister, for his defence of British interests when negotiating the Maastricht treaty. Fittingly, after 18 years on the Tory backbenches, Mr Aitken, a Beaverbrook scion, has reached the front bench by skipping the lowest rung on the ladder. As a journalist he campaigned against the Official Secrets Act and was cleared of breaching it at the Old Bailey. Mr Aitken has a trenchant debating style, which he demonstrated when likening the private legislation authorising self-regulation for the Lloyd's insurance market to 'cleaning the Augean stables with a toothbrush'. The MP for Thanet South, he championed his constituents' interests and maintained a Euro-sceptic stance when voting against the 'inadequate, unfair, partisan and rushed' plans for the Channel tunnel.

That might mean rewriting Articles 2 and 3 of the 1937 Irish constitution that lay claim to the six counties of Northern Ireland. The round-table talks - which will make an historic move to Dublin today - will be attended by the British and Irish governments, and three of the four main constitutional parties in Northern Ireland. The hardline Democratic Unionist party said on Friday that it would not be sending a delegation to Dublin, arguing that the Irish government had not shown flexibility on its territorial claim. However, a statement to unionist leaders in Stormont last Friday by Mr Andrews - leaked to Sunday newspapers in Dublin and Belfast - indicates that the Irish government said it was prepared to go ahead with a referendum in the context of an overall settlement.

The new handling centre for undeliverable letters will be opened in May at Donegall Quay, part of the Laganside inner-city redevelopment area. Mr Bill Cockburn, managing director of the Royal Mail, said: 'We are setting up a new national centre with state-of-the-art computer technology in place of numerous manually operated offices to make our return-letter service faster, more efficient and cost-effective. We are one of the few postal administrations in the world which offers a return-letter service - and which does not make any additional charge to the customer for this service above the normal postage rate.' The sender of an undeliver-able letter will get it back within two weeks with an explanation. The Royal Mail spends Pounds 8m a year dealing with mail that cannot be delivered, accounting for 120m of the 15bn items handled each year. The new centre is a timely stimulus for Ulster's economy after factory closures in the manufacturing sector in the past year. The government's policy of decentralising jobs to the regions has created about 1,500 jobs in the province in the past 18 months. There will be two national centres for stray mail. Belfast will deal with letters only and Portsmouth will handle packets. The siting of the service in Belfast will mean higher volumes of traffic from Northern Ireland to the mainland and will result in the Royal Mail's introducing additional direct routes to destinations throughout Britain, making deliveries faster and more efficient. The European Community awarded a Pounds 900,000 grant to the centre because Northern Ireland is designated a special development area.  The Financial Times   London Page 5  "

Their comments followed reports from Belfast that the IRA  was  considering declaring a brief truce to try to wring concessions  on the Downing Street declaration on Northern Ireland.    A REUTERS news agency report quoted republican sources in  Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic as saying a three-month  halt to attacks on British troops and police in the province was  under consideration at a series of secret IRA meetings. The  sources said the ceasefire was being floated to put pressure on  Britain to take a more active role in uniting Ulster with the  republic, according to REUTERS.    But Mr Adams told the Irish Republic's RTE broadcasting  network that he doubted there was any validity in the ceasefire  report.    Mr Reynolds, commenting after a meeting of his Fianna Fail  party in County Mayo, said the vast majority of people were  anxious that there should be an end to the violence. But he  stressed that a temporary ceasefire would not bring about a  renegotiation of the December 15 joint Anglo-Irish statement.    Mr Reynolds said the peace declaration could be  authoritatively explained by either the British or Irish  Government. But, in an apparent signal of growing Dublin  impatience with the failure of hard-line republicans to respond  to the initiative, he warned it would be unrealistic and  unacceptable to suggest the political issues could be resolved  in bilateral talks between anonymous British Government  representatives and Sinn Fein.    In the latest of a series of comments on the peace  initiative, Mr Reynolds claimed ""fairly comprehensive  clarification"" had now been given in a series of speeches and  public statements by him and Northern Ireland Secretary Sir  Patrick Mayhew. He added: ""I would ask everyone to address  themselves to that clarification and to the document itself --  so that we do not keep going round and round discussing points  that have already been dealt with.""    The fundamental problems of Northern Ireland had to be  resolved democratically around a table between all the parties  and the two governments, he said, adding: ""We would all soon  like to move on to that stage.""    The end of terrorist violence would produce a large peace  dividend that would have a major impact on prosperity throughout  Ireland.    Meanwhile, Mr Adams tonight spoke of his ambition to ""bring  an end to the IRA and take the gun out of Irish politics."" But  he insisted that the Downing Street peace declaration had fudged  the issue of Irish self-determination. Mr Adams, on RTE  television, claimed there were several ""matters of text"" in the  declaration that required clarification. The document first  addressed the self- determination issue, then went on to fudge  it, he said.    The Sinn Fein president's 20-minute interview was recorded  shortly before it was broadcast. It was shown in line with  official guidelines circulated earlier this month when the  Dublin government dropped a ban on TV and radio interviews with  members of the IRA, Sinn Fein and other groups with paramilitary  connections.    Mr Adams said: ""I am totally committed to moving out of the  conflict situation into a peaceful situation. What I want to do  -- and this is a judgment from me -- is to bring an end to the  Irish Republican Army, be part of taking the gun totally out of  Irish politics now.""    He added: ""It is a long time since a republican was ...  interviewed in an RTE studio. With 20 years of disinformation  to catch up on, I can tell you now that I am absolutely  confident that this generation of republicans will be part of  bringing about a lasting peace.    ""This Sinn Fein leadership is totally committed to bringing  that about ... The opportunity for peace will not be squandered  by republicans and we will not let the British Government  squander it.""    In Londonderry tonight, another Sinn Fein leader insisted  the  republican movement wanted ""a permanent peace, a peace built on  justice and equality and on democratic rights, including our  right as a nation to self-determination.""    Tom Hartley called on the British Government to withdraw the  Unionist veto to political change if it wanted a solution.    ""Unionists must be persuaded that their real strength lies  not in threats and vetoes, but in their place as a substantial  minority on the island of Ireland,"" he told a rally.    The Government had created the Unionist veto and had the  power to remove it. The veto had ""promoted intransigence and an  absolute unwillingness to consider any proposal for political  progress.""     "
0,FT942-7403 ,"FT942-7403 _AN-EEYDRAG6FT 940525   FT  25 MAY 94 / Survey of Ireland (8): EU helps out with 'cohesion' cash - John McManus looks at investment in transport and developments in the tourist industry      By JOHN MCMANUS   More than IPounds 3.5bn will be spent on Ireland's transport infrastructure and tourism industry over the next five years under the Irish government's IPounds 20bn National Development Plan. The money will come from the government, the private sector, and the European Union which has promised in the region of IPounds 7bn under the next tranche of cohesion funds. The first objective of the IPounds 2.6bn investment in transport infrastructure is to bring Ireland's roads, railways, ports and airports up to the same standard as its EU partners'. The main target is the national primary road network, which takes a quarter of all Irish road traffic. More than IPounds 1.1bn will go to improve the road links between the important cities, including the road from Dublin to Belfast. Spending on secondary and local roads will be much less significant: IPounds 115m will be spent on secondary roads and IPounds 475m on local roads. As a result, the motorist in Ireland can expect little respite from the potholes on the smaller rural roads and lanes. (They have become an election issue in some counties.) The rolling stock of Iarnrod Eireann, the state railway company, is to be upgraded, as are the tracks and signal systems on the parts of the Irish rail network which are included in the EU's Trans European Rail Network - mainly the links between Dublin and the larger cities and towns. With the opening of the Channel Tunnel, Ireland is now the only state in the EU without a direct rail link to the continent. The Irish government has promised to invest IPounds 100m upgrading strategic ports, including Dublin and its satellite port of Dun Laoghaire. No aid is available for improving ferries serving the routes between Ireland and its EU partners, but the two main ferry companies, Stena Sealink and Irish Continental Group, have announced ambitious ship building programmes. In Tasmania, Stena Sealink is constructing one of the world's largest car carrying catamaran ferries for use on the Irish sea this summer. The new super-ferry will replace the existing Stena Sea Lynx catamaran service between Dublin and the Welsh port of Holyhead. It will have capacity for 120 cars and 600 passengers, travel at 50 miles an hour, and Stena promises that it will cut the sea crossing time by half, to 99 minutes. Irish Continental has acquired one the the world's largest night ferries, the IPounds 56m Pride of Bilbao, for use on the routes from Rosslare, in Co Wexford, to northern France. The company has also commissioned a IPounds 46m ferry for use on the Dublin-Holyhead route next year, with an option for a second. The new Dublin-Holyhead ferry will triple the group's freight capacity on the route, allowing it to cut costs and - according to Mr Eamonn Rothwell, chief executive of Irish Continental - attract a substantial amount of the traffic, originating in the Republic, which now exits via the Northern Irish port of Larne. A IPounds 340m investment is proposed in the state's airports under the plan, on top of the IPounds 175m in state aid to the national carrier, Aer Lingus, which was approved by the EU last December. The money is to meet the cost of a big restructuring at the airline, which lost IPounds 56m last year. Aer Lingus has agreed to cut its costs by IPounds 50m and has obtained permission from the Irish government to fly direct from Dublin to cities in the US, avoiding the compulsory stop-over at Shannon airport in Co Clare, for the first time. Aer Lingus has also leased three new Airbus 330 aircraft for use on the transatlantic routes. The last 12 months have seen two new airlines enter the fiercely competitive Dublin to London route. Virgin Atlantic's City Jet - an Irish company operating a Virgin Atlantic franchise - started flying from Dublin to London City Airport in January. British Airways Express - a UK company operating a British Airways franchise - started flying from Dublin to Gatwick last year. The three airlines already on the route - Aer Lingus, British Midland and the small independent Ryanair - have all cut fares and cost as competition intensifies. Aer Lingus's share of the route has fallen from 49 per cent to 39 per cent; a big shake-out is planned. In a country with more than 16 per cent of its workforce on the dole, most aspects of the economy are ultimately evaluated in terms of their ability to create jobs. Ireland's tourism industry is no exception. The IPounds 1bn investment in tourism over the next five years is expected to create 35,000 jobs. Mr Matt McNulty, director general of Bord Failte, the Irish tourist board, believes that it is a realistic aspiration. Five years ago the board was set the target of doubling tourism revenue from just over IPounds 1bn and creating 25,000 jobs by the end of 1993. 'Revenue is up 74 per cent and 24,000 jobs have been created, despite the Gulf war and recession in our main markets,' Mr McNulty says. Mr McNulty believes that tourism can create jobs more effectively than other sectors of the economy; he points out that 75 per cent of the net job gains in Ireland over the past five years have come from tourism. Bord Failte estimates that the more than 3m tourists visiting Ireland each year spend about IPounds 1.8bn. The emphasis over the next five years will be to create 'sustainable tourism and sustainable jobs' through an intensification of the board's international marketing effort and extension of the the tourism season. Ireland's tourist season is only 23 weeks, but the board believes it can be stretched to 46 weeks by development of off-season 'products' and the creation of year-round attractions. More than 30 per cent of the IPounds 580m worth of EU cohesion funding hoped for by the Irish government for tourism will be spent on international marketing over the next five years. 'We have not fully exploited any market  -particularly Germany, which is the world's biggest,' explains Mr McNulty. Together with the traditional markets of the US, UK and continental Europe, Bord Failte plans to aim at new markets. Two countries seen as having large potential are Argentina and South Africa, both of which have strong Irish connections. The board's strategy is not to go for 'ethnic' tourism, but to target countries where Ireland is well known to the whole population because there is an Irish community there, Mr McNulty explains. The UK is still a very important market for Ireland; visitors from Britain made up 1.7m of more than 3m people who visited Ireland last year. The next biggest markets are continental Europe, with 874,000 visitors, and North America, with 417,000 visitors. About IPounds 300,000 will be spent on projects to extend the tourist season. The rest of the IPounds 1bn will be spent on training, a national conference centre and other projects. Mr McNulty believes that initiatives for projects to extend the length of the tourist season must come from the private sector. 'If we create something ourselves it is not likely to be sustainable,' he says. 'We have to let things develop naturally and support them through marketing or grant aid.' (Citing horse fairs, he points out that there have been many attempts to develop international horse fairs in Ireland, none of which have been as successful as the centuries-old horse fair at Ballinasloe in Co Galway, in the west of Ireland.) A good example of the type of investment that the board is trying to encourage is a project to revive a woollen mill at Foxford in Co Mayo, in the west of Ireland. The mill has been converted into a 'sheep to shop' experience for tourists, Mr McNulty says. This sort of project is an integral part of the role he sees for Bord Failte as 'Ireland's economic agency for tourism.' There is no doubting his enthusiasm for such projects. With something of the manner of a proud father, he cannot resist showing visitors to his office in Dublin an album of before-and-after shots of projects. He feels that he has a right to be proud: only one of the 300 projects funded in the last five years has failed - 'and we got nearly all our money back.'   Countries:-  IEZ  Ireland, EC.

0,FT942-7414 ,"FT942-7414 _AN-EEYDRAGVFT 940525   FT  25 MAY 94 / Survey of Ireland (3): A few wobbles have not upset the tandem - The Fianna Fail-Labour coalition is approaching the June Euro-elections in a confident mood      By TIM COONE   When the Fianna Fail-Labour coalition was formed in January 1993, after the last general election, some political pundits were predicting that it would not survive two years. The 1982-87 Fine Gael-Labour coalition broke down after four years, in disagreement over economic policy and over Labour's eclipse by its larger, and conservative partner, Fine Gael. The last coalition, formed in 1989 by Fianna Fail and the Progressive Democrats, collapsed in 1992, culminating in the spectacle of the two party leaders accusing each other of being liars from the witness box of a public inquiry into the Irish beef industry (the report of which is finally expected to see the light of day in June this year). Some early ministerial turf battles aside, the latest coalition partners have displayed a surprising degree of cohesion though, and are now approaching the June Euro-elections in confident mood. They are even contemplating an unprecedented voting pact to make sure that their candidates get an easy ride to Strasbourg. The few wobbles that have occurred in public, usually when the word privatisation has been mentioned, have not yet been sufficient to throw the tandem out of control. The latest batch of economic forecasts are confidently predicting strong growth, low inflation, and rising employment levels up to the end of the decade. Even the sun has been putting in a strong appearance over the past month after one of the dreariest and wettest winters on record. A spokesman for Mr Albert Reynolds, the prime minister, said: 'There is a strong feel-good factor and the government is riding high. 'The coalition is performing well, and if anything should go wrong, we will simply batten down the hatches and ride it out.' Mr Dick Spring, the deputy prime minister and Labour party leader is in an equally optimistic mood. 'We are well on course. Unemployment is edging down and other problem areas such as health, education and housing are effectively off the political agenda because of the progress that has been made on all these fronts,' he said. Public housing starts are well up, 17,000 people have been taken off hospital waiting lists, and additional resources are being pumped into education. If progress has not been as rapid on the jobs front as Labour would have hoped 'we have at least established our credibility with the markets in the past two budgets', said Mr Spring. With so much good news about, the opposition - flap its arms as it may  - has been unable to unnerve the complacent coalition beast. Fine Gael, the main opposition party, has still to recover from its miserable performance in the 1992 elections. Mr John Bruton, the party leader, with one eye constantly over his shoulder, wondering where the next challenge to his leadership might come from, has been unable to do more than snipe at occasional government blunders. Red faces there have been on government benches - when a promised pot of EU structural funds turned out to be only three-quarters full, when a middle-class outcry over a residential property tax sent the finance minister scurrying back to his calculator and when a whiff of sexual scandal entered the Dail (parliament) after a Labour minister was publicly reprimanded by Mr Spring for his 'poor judgement' in having chatted to a homosexual in his parked car in Dublin's Phoenix Park. But none of these issues have set coalition knees trembling. Issues that might, especially in Fianna Fail ranks, such as sorting out the now-ambiguous legal situation on abortion, and property rights in the event of divorce being introduced, are being quietly pushed on to the back burner. A bill to legalise homosexuality was passed last year, however, with barely a ripple of controversy. Causing more worries for government programme managers is Ms Mary Harney, the new leader of the Progressive Democrats (PD - the smaller of the two conservative opposition parties) and someone who has proved herself to be a tough and competent performer in the Dail. She is busily creating a higher profile for the party, and carefully targeting the right-wing vote which Fine Gael has traditionally monopolised. Sweeping tax reform, privatisation and a get-tough approach with Northern Ireland's paramilitaries are the PDs proposals for solving Ireland's problems. It is not so different from Mr Bruton's message, but somehow sounds more convincing coming from Ms Harney. According to Mr Spring, the two crucial political issues that are now facing the country are unemployment and the continuing crisis in Northern Ireland. The latter has dominated the political agenda of both Mr Reynolds and Mr Spring (who is also foreign minister) for most of the past eight months, although of the two, Mr Reynolds has grabbed most of the limelight. His joint declaration which was signed last December with Mr John Major, the British prime minister, succeeded in creating an entirely new framework for the settling of the Northern Ireland conflict, and simultaneously gave Mr Reynolds an entirely new framework for projecting his hitherto lacklustre image. His handling of the Anglo-Irish negotiations, during which he demonstrated that he could be a tenacious negotiator in handling Ireland's interests abroad, at the same time as being prepared to make honourable compromises and take imaginative and risky initiatives, has greatly boosted his reputation both at home and abroad. But there has been genuine disappointment, bordering on a sense of deception, that Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, has so far failed to grasp the olive branch held out to it. There is also growing frustration with the mathematics of UK parliamentary politics - the devastation of the Tories in the British local elections earlier this month, has raised fears in Dublin that Mr Major will now be even more beholden to the Ulster Unionists than ever to retain his slim Commons majority in the face of backbench revolts. Government priorities are therefore set to shift to the other key issue identified by Mr Spring - unemployment. Unfortunately, the job of making any significant inroads into the dole queues against a backdrop of rising unemployment within the EU is likely to prove as frustrating as the Northern Ireland peace process. Those same sunny economic forecasts also predict that long-term unemployment is likely to remain stubbornly high at 18 per cent until the year 2000. The coalition has at least three years to run before the next general election is due, and Mr Spring is confident that it can hold together. He of course stands to lose most if it fails. Labour's vote doubled to a record 21 per cent in 1992 as unemployment figures also reached record highs. Failure to deliver on jobs could see that vote halve again as easily as it doubled - and the 'new era' Mr Spring promised for Irish politics 18 months ago may in retrospect appear to have been a mere flash in the pan.

It was the first terrorist murder in the province since a blueprint for a peace accord was agreed more than a fortnight ago by Mr John Major and Mr Albert Reynolds. The 23-year-old soldier was the ninth member of the security forces killed by IRA snipers in the border areas of south Armagh and County Fermanagh in the past two years. The shooting underlined the increasingly hardline tone of republican paramilitary groups towards the document from the two premiers. Mr John Fee, a Social Democratic and Labour party councillor who lives near Crossmaglen, said of the shooting: 'There are many throughout the nationalist and republican community who will be saying this should not have happened.' The shooting came amid growing discontent in the Ulster Unionist party, the largest unionist party. UUP support is seen by the two governments as essential to the success of the peace initiative. Sir John Wheeler, security minister at the Northern Ireland Office, condemned the shooting as a 'wicked crime', but he stopped short of threatening a security clampdown. The hardening of attitudes among republicans has prompted calls from unionist leaders for immediate tougher government security measures. It has also fuelled doubts about the peace process among some UUP members. UUP leaders said that yesterday's shooting would not be allowed to derail the peace process. Although the leadership's cautious endorsement of the premiers' declaration appears to have wide support, the tactics have also provoked anger. One UUP councillor said: 'There's a lot of people here who are very unhappy with the declaration.' Mr Ken Maginnis, UUP MP for Fermanagh and South Tyrone, said dissenters were a minority in the party. The Rev Roy Magee, a Belfast minister who has had talks with loyalist paramilitary groups, said they had been prepared to give the peace process a chance. But yesterday's shooting of the soldier might threaten that.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P9721 International Affairs.   Types:-  NEWS  General News.

0,FT934-4311 ,"FT934-4311 _AN-DLEAMABMFT 931204   FT  04 DEC 93 / Major shifts position in Ulster talks: Dublin stresses end to IRA violence - Go-between explains republican 'pique'      By TIM COONE      DUBLIN   Irish persistence paid off at yesterday's Anglo-Irish summit in Dublin, with the British delegation being persuaded to work intensively on the joint declaration being sought by Dublin aimed at a permanent halt to IRA violence. Considerable differences remain over its phrasing, which will be discussed in subsequent summits scheduled for later in the month. Agreement is by no means assured. But the Irish government can derive some satisfaction in having convinced Mr John Major to tackle the peace process before moving on to British concerns over constitutional issues, in particular the Irish republic's territorial claim to Northern Ireland. The Irish proposal, contained in a document tabled last July, has been back and forth between the two governments since, and disagreement over its focus on the issue of Irish self-determination has been the principal stumbling block to progress on the peace initiative. Self-determination is viewed as a loaded term by the British and by Northern Ireland's unionists, who see it as implying a veto by the republic over constitutional changes in the north. The Irish insist that this is not so. Mr Noel Dempsey, the Irish government chief whip, said: 'There seems to be some confusion in the British government's mind as to what we mean by self-determination.' He added: 'What we are talking about is separate referenda, north and south, where both peoples in both parts of the island can make their views known. If consent is freely given, if a majority in both parts of the island decide that they want a united Ireland, of whatever form, then we will abide by that. We are not talking about collective self-determination.' In Belfast, Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, last night said that hopes for an immediate unilateral ceasefire by the IRA was 'unrealistic'. Mr Richard Macaulay, Sinn Fein official spokesman, said: 'It is unrealistic to expect that the IRA will unilaterally end their actions without political progress.' Mr Jim Rodgers, deputy leader of the official Unionist Party on Belfast City Council, warned that loyalist paramilitaries were preparing a backlash if the London-Dublin peace process led to big concessions to the nationalist community. While the talks were taking place the army discovered a 1,000lb IRA bomb intended for an army patrol. The device was planted on the outskirts of Belfast near a primary school. The nationalist goal of a united Ireland does not seem to be as crucial to Catholics in Northern Ireland as many have believed. An opinion poll in yesterday's Irish Times indicated that only 32 per cent of Catholics in Ulster favour a united Ireland, although 65 per cent favour a constitutional change involving a greater role for Dublin.

0,FT934-2312 ,"FT934-2312 _AN-DLOCPAAHFT 931215   FT  15 DEC 93 / Britain and Ireland agree Ulster peace accord      By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor   An Anglo-Irish declaration aimed at ending 25 years of IRA violence and paving the way for a permanent political settlement in Northern Ireland will be unveiled in London today by Mr John Major and Mr Albert Reynolds. After a day of non-stop telephone diplomacy between the British and Irish prime ministers, Whitehall officials said the statement would be released after a Downing Street meeting between the two leaders this morning. With only a few minor differences remaining to be settled, Mr Major expects to spell out the accord in the House of Commons a few hours later. He was last night also considering the possibility of a prime ministerial broadcast to outline the details to the people of Northern Ireland. The declaration, designed to reconcile the competing interests of the province's unionist majority with the aspirations of Irish nationalists will be hailed by both leaders as the best chance since 1968 for an end to terrorism. Mr Reynolds and the Irish foreign minister, Mr Dick Spring, briefed a specially convened cabinet meeting late last night on the joint declaration. The cabinet fully endorsed the document in its final draft form. The Whitehall officials said that the document would underline the 'irrelevance' of the military campaign being waged by the IRA to secure a united Ireland. British intelligence reports suggest the leaders of the IRA and Sinn Fein, its political wing, are already embroiled in a fierce argument over whether to end the campaign. The statement will also provide the springboard for the relaunch of talks among the constitutional parties aimed at restoring devolved government to Northern Ireland. But even as Mr Major and Mr Reynolds were clearing the remaining obstacles, some leading unionist politicians were questioning if the declaration would bring lasting peace. The statement will include a firm guarantee to the Protestant majority in the province that its status as part of the UK could only be changed with their consent. It will also signal Mr Reynolds' willingness to drop the Republic's constitutional claim to the north in the event of a permanent political settlement. But in return Mr Major has agreed to language in the declaration which goes further than hitherto in acknowledging the aspirations of those seeking a united Ireland. He has accepted wording affirming the right of 'self-determination' for 'the people of Ireland, north and south'. The statement will also underline that the British government has no 'selfish or strategic interest' in keeping Northern Ireland within the UK if a majority of its people were to vote for unity with the Republic. Despite the strong affirmation of the veto on any constitutional change wielded by the majority, such phrases could provoke an angry reaction among unionists. Mr Reynolds, who has said he would not accept any declaration which did not offer a reasonable prospect of an end to the IRA campaign, also appears to have won agreement on the establishment of a new Irish convention. Mr Major will stress that the convention, designed to provide an early opportunity for Sinn Fein to join talks, will not have any real authority. He appears to have succeeded in removing from the communique a call for parallel referendums in the north and south. But the precise phrases in this section of the communique will be critical in determining the impact of the declaration. If they move too far in the direction of Sinn Fein, they will threaten a unionist backlash against Mr Major's government and its fragile majority at Westminster. That in turn could trigger a renewed escalation in the terrorist campaign being waged by Protestant paramilitaries. Officials acknowledged last night that the two leaders were uncertain if the statement would persuade the IRA to abandon its military campaign. One British minister said it might mark the 'beginning, not the end' of the search for peace. An important figure in the moderate Ulster Unionist party, whose support will be essential, was less sanguine. He predicted the declaration would be a 'mish-mash with one bit of it contradicting the other'. Mr Spring was optimistic about the prospects for peace. He said: 'I believe peace is possible in a very short period of time . . . the intention (of the joint declaration) is to lead to a cessation of violence and with that our hopes go.'

In Belfast Sinn Fein emerged with 23.2 per cent, the biggest share of the vote for any party, outpolling even the Ulster Unionist party. Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, said the result 'has dramatically renovated Sinn Fein's mandate'. Across the province the Sinn Fein vote increased by 1.5 percentage points to 12.5 per cent, winning it 51 council seats out of the 582 total. The Ulster Unionist party, the largest party in Northern Ireland, saw its support slip by 5 points to 29 per cent, although it increased the number of seats it holds from 193 to 197. Mr Herbert Ditty, the hard-line unionist Lord Mayor of Belfast, lost his seat to Mr Chris McGimpsey, an independent unionist, but control of the council remains in Unionist hands by a slim majority. Mr Ken Maginnis, deputy leader of the UUP, lost his seat in Dungannon, while the nationalist SDLP consolidated its hold on Derry council, winning an absolute majority of 17 seats. The turnout across the province was 55 per cent. The overall nationalist vote apparently rose as Unionist participation fell. The main loser has been the Conservative party, which saw most of the gains it made in the 1989 local elections wiped out. The Conservatives won only six seats, against more than 10 last time, with support apparently drifting back to the centrist Alliance party. The Alliance vote increased by 1 point to 7.7 per cent, but its support appears increasingly concentrated in the middle-class areas of the east and south-east of the province. Mr Brian Feeney, a spokesman for the SDLP, said the vote for the political extremes had hardened in those areas which had suffered the most political violence over the past year, while the vote for the more moderate SDLP, UUP and Alliance parties had held up or improved where there was greater stability. He said the Belfast result 'will have knocked a lot of people back on their heels'. Mr Addie Morrow, until recently the chairman of the Alliance party, said: 'I believe the result is very bad for the future of Northern Ireland. The electorate has given no encouragement for the parties to get together and negotiate.' Mr Richard McCaulay, the spokesman for Sinn Fein, whose party has been excluded from talks because of its support for the IRA, said future political talks 'are almost certain to fail unless a process is developed which excludes no-one'. The DUP described its result as 'a left hook' to efforts by Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, to get talks going again. Mr Peter Robinson, the DUP deputy leader, said: 'If Sir Patrick Mayhew cannot read the message of this election then he needs glasses.' The DUP 'is not interested in the talks on the basis of the blueprint that (Sir Patrick) has offered'.

0,FT934-2492 ,"FT934-2492 _AN-DLND1ACDFT 931214   FT  14 DEC 93 / PM says any accord must be 'balanced'      By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor   Mr John Major acknowledged yesterday that a Anglo-Irish declaration designed to restore peace to Northern Ireland would have to balance guarantees to unionists with recognition of the aspirations of the province's nationalists. As British officials suggested that he might yet hold a third meeting with Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, as early as tomorrow, Mr Major told MPs they were seeking a declaration that would end IRA terrorism. Despite a fierce warning from the Rev Ian Paisley, Democratic Unionist leader, of a Protestant backlash, Mr Major said both premiers wanted a 'balanced' declaration. His comments appeared to signal that the government is ready to give some ground to demands from Mr Reynolds that Dublin's acceptance of a unionist veto must be accompanied by language in the statement which would have a reasonable chance of securing a cessation of IRA violence. Mr Major appeared to shift further in that direction with his explicit acknowledgement during comments on the weekend IRA murder of two policemen that he was looking for 'a circumstance that will end such murders in future'. It is thought that the talks inched forward during the course of the day. An Irish government spokesman said last night that the two prime ministers would be in touch by phone this morning to review progress and to try to agree the date for their third meeting in as many weeks. Mr Major said he could offer no guarantee that a declaration would be agreed before parliament breaks for the Christmas recess on Friday, and it was still possible that the talks would break down. But Downing Street aides said a further meeting would take place before Christmas. Mr Paisley warned that the price demanded by the IRA was 'too high'. Another warning was delivered by a leading member of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA. Mr Mitchel McLaughlin, chairman of Sinn Fein's Ulster executive, said that if the opportunity of peace was 'squandered', Northern Ireland could face civil war.

Representatives of the Combined Loyalist Military Command - the umbrella group for all loyalist paramilitaries - are to hold a press conference today, after reaching agreement in principle to call a halt. The ceasefire is expected to start at the weekend. Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, said a ceasefire was overdue but would be welcomed. 'We would want to see if it was conditional or unconditional. We would want, of course, to see if it was permanent,' he said in Bournemouth. 'We would look at it in precisely the same way as we look at the republican ceasefire announcement of the 31st of August.' An announcement today would be opportune timing for the government, with the Conservative conference due to debate the situation in the province this afternoon. Proceedings are likely to be heated, with the party's grassroots in the province seeking backing for an amendment urging the government actively to persuade Ulster that its best future lies within the UK. The announcement would also come just before Saturday's Ulster Unionist party conference in Carrickfergus. The peace process speeded up when the government gave loyalist leaders permission to enter the Maze Prison on Monday to hold talks with Ulster Defence Association and Ulster Volunteer Force inmates. Ministers in Bournemouth predicted today's move could pave the way for the UK government to give a conditional acknowledgement next week that the IRA intends its cessation of violence to be permanent. In the absence of an unequivocal IRA statement that it has permanently renounced terrorism, senior ministers have been discussing a formula under which they would state that it was their 'working assumption' that the IRA had renounced violence. That in turn would pave the way for an early lifting of the exclusion orders which prevent prominent members of Sinn Fein travelling to mainland Britain. It would also signal that the London government would be ready to engage soon in 'talks about talks' with Sinn Fein. It was also clear last night that the loyalist paramilitary organisations could not expect a place at the negotiating table to discuss a new constitutional structure for Northern Ireland. Ministers said the groups had 'no democratic mandate'. Rev Roy Magee, a Belfast minister who has had talks with loyalist paramilitary groups and is said to be close to loyalist opinion, indicated that political representatives of the paramilitaries will seek a place at the table in any talks which include Sinn Fein. 'Their views must be taken on board,' he said. High-risk Ulster vote, Page 12   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P9721 International Affairs.     P8651 Political Organizations.

Speaking on Irish radio, the Rev Martin Smyth, Ulster Unionist MP for South Belfast, said that if Sinn Fein delivered a genuine cessation of violence in Northern Ireland the Ulster Unionists would give Sinn Fein 'the recognition that they are a bona fide political party and have a right to take part in a political process, representing those who vote for them . . . It is not a question of saying we'll give you this or give you that, that is a matter for discussion when they come (to the negotiating table)'. He also said in an earlier interview with the BBC that Sinn Fein should recognise unionist rights to be part of the UK. Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, described Mr Smyth's comments as 'positive and constructive' and added: 'It has always been my view that a cessation of violence would radically transform the situation.' The Irish government continues to guard its silence however regarding the content of the peace initiative launched two weeks ago by Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein leader, and Mr John Hume, the leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party. After receiving a briefing on the initiative last week from Mr John Hume, Mr Reynolds said the initiative would be evaluated by the Irish cabinet next Tuesday. After yesterday's cabinet meeting however, the Dublin government said only that 'evaluation is ongoing' and gave no indication whether any proposals are about to made to the British government. The Hume-Adams initiative appears to be driving a wedge into Unionist ranks, with the Democratic Unionist party reacting angrily to the latest UUP position. Mr Peter Robinson, deputy leader of the DUP said: 'Since Sunningdale (the 1973 conference which established an ill-fated power sharing executive without the DUP), no deeper wound has been inflicted upon unionism than this.' He said the UUP position was 'an act of monumental folly'.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.     IEZ  Ireland, EC.   Industries:-  P8651 Political Organizations.

It is simply that the Irish government want to achieve it by peaceful means, and the IRA otherwise.'

With unionist leaders warning that support for loyalist violence is growing in the community because of its growing sense of alienation, the Rev Ian Paisley, the Democratic Unionist Party leader, attacked the 'sell-out' which he claimed would see the British government give in to the latest republican demands. Mr Adams called in a speech to European election workers in Belfast for a full amnesty for IRA prisoners, whose 'speedy release' was a matter of urgent concern. He said the government would have to legislate away provisions which gave unionists a veto over political and constitutional change. It would also have to accept the right of the Irish people to national self-determination. Sinn Fein has said that it would respond to the Downing Street declaration after next week's Euro-elections, although the government says acceptance of the document is not a prerequisite for republicans to join the peace process. Mr Paisley said he feared that Mr Adams would succeed in his request for the speedy release of all long-term prisoners. The government, however, has committed itself against any amnesty for convicted terrorists. Mr Paisley said the call for an end to the unionist veto meant that the majority unionist vote in Northern Ireland had to be subverted and the province forced into an all-Ireland republic. Mr Dick Spring, Irish deputy premier, yesterday criticised Sinn Fein for delaying its response to the Downing Street declaration and again stressed that the IRA would have to enact a permanent cessation of violence before it could join the peace process. He told the Dail: 'It has to be permanent; there can be no equivocation about that.' He added: 'There is little point in attempting to bring people into political dialogue if they are doing so on the basis of 'we will give it a try, but if it does not work, we will go back to the bomb and the bullet'.'

Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, said he believed there were 'still grounds for reasonable hope' that Sinn Fein would respond positively to the Downing Street peace declaration. But he stressed that talks - to be based on the document - would not wait for its decision. He added: 'We are ready to go at any time.' His suggestion that Mr Ian Paisley's DUP would also be unable to veto political progress was immediately backed by Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary. Sir Patrick said: 'We should not permit the process to be halted by the action of those who are eligible to join in but who say, 'No we are not coming'.' The DUP has refused to join the talks unless the British government abandons the Downing Street declaration. Mr Reynolds, speaking on BBC television, said his meeting on Saturday with Mr John Major, the prime minister, had allayed concerns that future talks might be narrowly based on an internal political settlement in Ulster. Mr Reynolds said both sides now had a clearly agreed starting point for the next talks, which would embrace the so-called three-stranded process. He said he believed the mainly nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party, which has not yet committed itself to the talks, would be 'content and happy' with the outcome of the weekend talks. It is understood that the SDLP, in an unpublicised session, met Sir Patrick last week to discuss his 'check-list' of ideas for political progress which have been submitted to Dublin. Although London has, in return for assurances about the scope of the talks, persuaded Dublin to commit itself to pressing on with them, both governments will maintain a low-key approach at least until after Sinn Fein's annual conference outside Dublin next weekend.

0,FT934-5715 ,"FT934-5715 _AN-DK2DYAA7FT 931129   FT  29 NOV 93 / Ulster politics of discontent poisoned further: PM will try to stem damage by publishing documents      By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor   There is nothing new about contacts between British governments and representatives of Sinn Fein. Nor is it the first time in 25 years of carnage that the IRA has made private overtures about peace. But the storm whipped up by the revelation of extensive contacts between Mr John Major's administration and Mr Martin McGuinness of Sinn Fein was no less embarrassing for that. After months of painstaking effort to nurture a climate of reassurance to allow the resumption of talks on a political settlement in the province, Mr Major faced a barrage of criticism at the weekend. Opposition leaders joined hard-line Ulster unionists in accusing Mr Major and Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, of lies at worst and skilful duplicity at best. The Rev Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionist Party appeared confident that it now had the ammunition to blow up efforts by London and Dublin to agree a constitutional framework for Ulster which would marginalise the terrorists. British ministers acknowledged that the disclosure of the talks - just a week after the damaging leak in Dublin of the Irish government's draft proposals for a political settlement - would poison further the atmosphere of distrust which permeates Northern Ireland politics. But Downing Street insisted that no direct lies had been told. Mr Major's constant disavowal of negotiations or talks with Sinn Fein was technically accurate. Replies through intermediaries were not quite the same thing. That, in the famous words of a former cabinet secretary, is what is known as being economical with the truth. But Mr Major hopes the publication later today of all the documents which passed between his government and Sinn Fein will begin to repair the damage. Significantly, the message from Number 10 Downing Street was that he had fully approved of the contacts and would stand firmly by Sir Patrick. He would also press ahead with efforts to end the violence and to put in place a durable political settlement. Officials said the documents would show that the government had been as constant in its approach in private as in public. It had offered a place at the negotiating table to Sinn Fein, but only after a permanent end to violence. The officials were unapologetic about the contacts - Mr Major's view was that the government could not possibly ignore the possibility that the IRA was serious about an end to violence. That possibility was taken seriously by British intelligence and by the Irish government and Mr John Hume, the leader of Ulster's mainly Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party. As one British official said recently, most of the terrorist organisations which have plagued the west since the 1970s - from the Red Brigades to the PLO - had given up. Even Libya appeared reluctant now to sponsor terrorists. So 'we have to allow for the possibility that the IRA has had enough'. Sir Patrick hopes that the mainstream Ulster Unionists led by Mr James Molyneaux will accept that the contacts did not amount to anything approaching a conspiracy to undercut the government's constitutional guarantee on the future of Ulster. His fear must be that if Mr Paisley manages to take grassroots Protestant opinion with him, then Mr Molyneaux also will be dragged towards complete disavowal of a search for a comprehensive settlement. There were one or two hopeful signs yesterday. Conservative MPs strongly committed to the preservation of the union chose not to attack the prime minister. Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, said it would have been wrong not to respond to the IRA. Mr Molyneaux, briefed in advance of the revelation, appeared ready to reserve judgment. But trust - or rather the absence of it - has always been the deciding factor in efforts to restore peace to Northern Ireland. Nobody in London could argue that the latest revelations would not heighten suspicion and hostility. Mr Major and Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, will try to rebuild confidence at their forthcoming summit, still pencilled in for Friday of this week. Mr Reynolds does not want the issue to sour the atmosphere at the meeting. The two leaders will seek to reassure the unionists with a communique restating Dublin's willingness to drop its constitutional claim to Northern Ireland and to accept the Protestant majority's veto over changes in the status of the province. Mr Reynolds wants to complement that with a statement designed to reinforce the pressure on Sinn Fein to come in from the terrorist cold - a 'framework for peace' which would recognise the aspirations of the nationalist community while offering guarantees to the unionists. But Mr Major will find it hard if not impossible now to maintain contact with Sinn Fein. The need to reassure Mr Molyneaux will make still harder the compromises essential to any political settlement. In her recent memoirs Baroness Thatcher warned her successors of the intractability of Northern Ireland. Distrust mounting to hatred and revenge was never far beneath the political surface. 'Those who step on it', she concluded, 'must do so gingerely'. Mr Major no longer needs telling.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P9721 International Affairs.

Yet the latest quarterly regional industrial trends survey from the Confederation of British Industry and Business Strategies, a regional consultancy, suggests that the improvement, although widespread, is not strong enough to offset all adverse local factors. A positive balance of companies in the 11 regions said orders rose in the four months to April, but returns pointed to a small decline in overall demand in northern England and Scotland in the four months to July. By contrast, the south-east and west Midlands, where companies experienced a severe recession, appeared to be in the forefront of recovery. This was a sign of the upturn becoming more firmly rooted, the survey says. Output increased in all regions except Northern Ireland in the four months to April: the first such rise in all mainland Britain for four years. Output is expected to rise everywhere except Scotland and the north during the four months to July. Mr Charles Burton, Business Strategies joint managing director, said Scotland and the north were hit by a reduction in North Sea oil investment. A boom in Scottish electronic production appeared to be ending, while industries in the north were hit by pit closures. The survey, carried out between March 25 and April 13, found that the east and west Midlands, the south-east and Wales had experienced 'appreciable' increases in demand during the past four months. The four regions, together with the north-west, East Anglia and Northern Ireland, expected continued strong order growth in the present four-month period. A positive balance of companies in all regions expected export order growth in the four months to July. Only Yorkshire and Humberside reported a net drop in export orders in the four months to April. The survey found companies in eight of the 11 regions planning to increase investment in plant and machinery in the next 12 months. Investment is still expected to fall slightly in the south-east, the biggest region, reflecting the depth of the recession. This set a low base for the recovery which so far has generated no powerful motive for investment. Manufacturing industry continued to shed jobs in most regions in the second quarter, although employment in-creased in Wales and the west Midlands compared with a year ago. The survey says that increases in demand and output are not leading to any marked increase in price pressures. CBI/BSL Regional Trends Survey, May 1994.

Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew and deputy  Dublin premier Dick Spring are to meet near the Irish Republic's  border with Ulster in Co Cavan at the formal opening of a  restored canal.    The pair had already agreed on a two-hour exchange of views  on the progress of their two governments' current push for a  Northern Ireland settlement in the light of Britain's reply last  week to questions posed by Sinn Fein -- the IRA's political wing  -- about the five-month-old Downing Street peace declaration.    But the gun and bomb attack on a Dublin pub as Sinn Fein  staged a fund-raising event on the premises has sharpened the  agenda for the discussions. The loyalist Ulster Volunteer Force  [UVF] tonight claimed responsibility for the attack which left  one man dead and a second wounded.    In a statement released in Belfast today, the outlawed  terror  group boasted that it had ""struck at the very heart of the  republican movement in its own back yard.""    Mr Spring tonight said he was disturbed about what happened,  and confirmed the bombing would be high on the agenda when he  saw Sir Patrick.    One doorman was shot dead and another seriously wounded when  they blocked the entry of the gang of bombers.    The intruders fled after the shooting, leaving their holdall  bomb. Its failure to ignite prevented certain carnage, police  said.    Both Mr Spring and Prime Minister Albert Reynolds -- who is  due to have talks on peace of his own in London later this week  with John Major -- had already signalled their growing concern  about loyalist attacks in Belfast and other parts of Northern  Ireland.    The spread of the violence across the border -- and deep  into  the centre of Dublin -- has rung security alarm bells in both  the Irish capital and Belfast. The fear was that the incident  at the Widow Scallan's bar could herald the opening of a new  campaign in the Irish Republic. Until now the assumption had  been that loyalist paramilitaries lacked the expertise and the  neccessary network of escape routes to strike so far south.    Yet the signs were that not only had their raid been  executed, even though the 18lb commercial mix bomb failed to go  off, but the three-man gang had either got back safely into  Ulster, or gone to ground at a ""safe-house"". The belief among  Dublin police tonight was that the gang had carefully laid plans  to escape from the Republic before road checkpoints were in  operation at around midnight on Saturday night.    The UVF assault was the most menacing by Ulster loyalists  south of the border since 1974, when bombs in Dublin and the  frontier town of Monaghan claimed 33 lives.    Suspicions have persisted among relatives of the dead that  loyalists were aided then by Northern Ireland-based security  personnel. No arrests were ever made in connection with those  bombings.

Mr Adams, in a joint communique issued in Northern Ireland with Mr John Hume, the leader of the nationalist Social Democratic Labour Party (SDLP), said that 'significant progress' had been made towards the conditions necessary for a 'peace-ful and democratic accord'. The statement, in which they said they were hopeful that the peace process could be moved forward, came after a week of suggestions and hints that the IRA might be about to call an extended ceasefire in an attempt to put pressure on the British and Irish governments to make concessions over possible peace talks. They warned that: 'In any new situation there is a heavy onus on the British government to respond positively, both in terms of the demilitarisation of the situation and in assisting the search for an agreed Ireland by encouraging the process of national reconciliation.' There is growing expectation that an extended IRA ceasefire will be announced this week. Although most unlikely to be a declaration of a permanent end to the IRA's 25-year military campaign, there are hopes it could mark the first step in de-escalating the conflict. London and Dublin would almost certainly react to even an extended ceasefire by saying it did not amount to a permanent cessation of violence and so did not justify allowing republican leaders into political talks on Northern Ireland's future. Whitehall officials have been particularly heartened by the hard line recently taken on this issue by Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister. But an open-ended ceasefire would put the two governments under intense pressure to make some conciliatory gesture. Republican leaders would hope that this pressure would in turn put the governments' united front under fresh strain. A series of meetings between Mr Hume and Mr Adams from April last year was one factor which provided impetus for the peace process. It was followed by the signing of the Downing Street declaration in December last year by Mr John Major, the British prime minister, and his Irish counterpart, Mr Albert Reynolds. Last night Mr Reynolds, in a detailed response to the joint statement, said there was an historic opportunity for a settlement of the Ulster conflict. 'It is clear that Sinn Fein and the IRA are in the final stage of their deliberations,' he said. Meanwhile, the Ulster Unionist party disclosed last night that its leader, Mr James Molyneaux, will have discussions with Mr Major in Downing Street during the week about the search for peace. The Downing Street declaration offers Sinn Fein a seat at the negotiating table in the event of a permanent IRA ceasefire, and an eventual simultaneous referendum in both parts of Ireland on a future constitutional arrangement for the province.

Downing Street responded sharply to suggestions by Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, that peace could be achieved by Christmas if the two governments focused on a cessation of violence followed by talks with Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing. Officials said Mr John Major had ruled out 'secret agreements on a ceasefire with violent organisations', and was 'wary of false optimism' in Dublin. Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, suggested the timetable outlined by Mr Reynolds could hinder the peace process. 'I don't think that this is a process that will benefit from governments saying that this must be achieved in a fortnight, or that must be achieved in a month,' he said. Sir Patrick tried to minimise the significance of the differences between Mr Reynolds and Mr Major by insisting that it was 'a mistake to look for evidence of disagreement between the two governments. There is none'. Mr Reynolds responded swiftly to the British comments. He said in a statement that 'peace cannot wait'. He added: 'Time is not on our side.' The exchanges reflect simmering differences between London and Dublin over the framework for the peace process, which was launched by the two governments in Brussels two weeks ago. Britain wants round-table discussions involving the two governments and Northern Ireland's four non-violent political parties, which are in the middle of bilateral talks with Mr Major. The British government insists that Sinn Fe'in should be included in the talks only after a permanent and unconditional cessation of IRA violence. The Irish government favours a separate peace process in which talks would focus on achieving an IRA ceasefire, followed by the inclusion of Sinn Fein in talks. Irish support for this strategy has hardened since the annual conference of the governing Fianna Fail party at the weekend revealed strong grass roots support for peace proposals put forward by Mr John Hume, SDLP leader, and Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein. However, the Hume-Adams proposals, which called for a ceasefire followed by talks with Sinn Fein, have been rejected by the British government. Sir Patrick repeated the British approach yesterday in the House Magazine, a journal produced for MPs, saying: 'The government will never negotiate with those who support threaten or perpetrate violence, or who fail to show their disavowal of such evil is for real.' Three men were remanded in custody by a special court in Limavady, Co Londonderry, charged with the murders of seven people shot dead 10 days ago in the Rising Sun bar in nearby Greysteel. They were also charged with membership of the Ulster Freedom Fighters and with possession of firearms. One was further charged with the murder of four Catholic workmen at Castlerock, Co Londonderry, in March.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.     IEZ  Ireland, EC.

0,FT924-8444 ,"FT924-8444 _AN-CKKCIACBFT 921111   FT  11 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Ulster talks reach uncertain end      By RALPH ATKINS and TIM COONE   MORE THAN six months of talks on Northern Ireland's political future ended last night with the aspirations of unionists and nationalists far apart and a last-minute failure to agree even an outline of areas of common agreement. Negotiations broke up in Belfast with a joint statement saying there had been no 'comprehensive accommodation in relation to the deep-seated and long-standing problems'. Nor was there a 'heads-of-agreement' document as hoped for last week by Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary. He will make a statement to MPs today. Although the talks could restart next year, the collapse is a further blow for British and Irish hopes that negotiations could bring movement after two decades of failed political initiatives. Possible straws of hope are the historic ground that was broken - notably Ulster Unionists negotiating with Irish ministers in Dublin - and the fact that channels of communication have been established and some mutual suspicious broken. Mr James Molyneaux, Ulster Unionist party leader, said: 'We will persevere in our efforts to achieve progress through informal consultations.' Mr John Hume, leader of the mainly nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party, said that for the first time ever there had been serious discussions on all sides. Sir Ninian Stephen, a former governor-general of Australia who acted as independent chairman, said the talks objectives were still 'achievable'. Against that is the last minute procedural squabbling, apparently triggered by the calling of a general election in the Irish republic, that delayed the final plenary from Friday until yesterday. But the costs in terms of discouraging investment in the province, and the possible encouragement the latest setback might have given to those who believe a solution requires resorting to violence, are incalculable. Security forces believe the IRA is still potent. Loyalist paramilitaries remain active. The talks, which began in earnest in April after a brief session before the UK general election, suggest a consensus is elusive. The circumstances were propitious. Time was not a problem and media attention was scant. But, as one Dublin official, admited, 'we have only recently begun to scratch at the surface of the issues'. Three areas were covered: Government in the province. Unionists favour an elected Northern Ireland assembly with powers devolved from Westminster. The SDLP want a system of 'commissioners' that would give nationalists a direct input into decision making. Relations between north and south. Unionists favoured consultative bodies; the SDLP wanted them to have executive powers. Replacements for the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement. Unionists wanted a more loose deal, The SDLP and the Irish government wanted only a pact that could 'transcend' the original. The most public arguments were over the Irish constitutional claim over the north. The Democratic Unionist party wanted the articles withdrawn unilaterally and has refused to talk in Dublin until they were. Dublin, in turn, only said it 'could' - not 'would' - hold a referendum to change its constitution. The general election in Ireland has created a good excuse for a pause for reflection. Unionists hope the opposition Fine Gael party will lead a new coalition, since it is more amenable to immediate concessions on articles two and three. But the unionists should not expect to achieve that without some reciprocity. And all sides have yet to show they can strike a deal.  The Financial Times   London Page 12  "

On March 17, St Patrick's Day, the US president played host to a gathering at the White House which those attending will not easily forget. The guest list, led by Irish Prime Minister Albert Reynolds, included US trade union leaders, presidential advisers, human rights lawyers, businessmen, congressmen and senators. All were drawn by enthusiasm for America's Irish heritage. The evening underlined Clinton's own interest in Irish affairs. He was meeting the challenge laid down by Reynolds, that, as 'political leaders, we must show daring as never before . . . in bringing about the goal of peace'. Among those attending was a leading Irish American businessman Don Keough, the former head of Coca-Cola. Commenting on the significance of the evening for Irish Americans, Keough said: 'It's like the end of a journey. We all had a feeling of finally arriving.' There has been Irish razzamatazz in the White House before. John F Kennedy held some cultural soirees, and Ronald Reagan entertained Tip O'Neill, the legendary speaker on Capitol Hill. But never had the invitation list been so long; never had the evening been so political in its scope, drawing in many of those interested in that most touchy of Irish subjects, Northern Ireland. As Clinton himself later boasted, the last time the White House had hosted a comparable party was under 'Old Hickory' Andrew Jackson, the first Irish American to be voted in as president. So who has arrived and where? On the basis of blood alone, Clinton is not a natural player in American ethnic politics. Much as he might have proclaimed his Irish roots during his presidential campaign, these are not particularly deep or immediate. One theory is that his maternal ancestors, the Cassidys, settled in South Carolina in the 17th century, Protestant emigrants from Ulster. This is hardly the stuff of Irish nationalism, but it was enough for the Clinton presidential campaign to set up Irish liaison groups and to garner as many votes as Kennedy did among Irish-Americans. In return, Clinton promised the earth - or so it seemed to those Irish republicans who had long sought to draw the US into playing an active role in Northern Ireland. The 'earth' was Clinton's promise to send a presidential envoy to sort out the mess in Belfast. Since becoming president, Clinton has put the envoy idea on the backburner. But his decision in February to grant a visa to Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, against the advice of state department officials and UK government objections, seemed to presage a new activism. To Irish-Americans such as Niall O'Dowd, editor of New York's Irish Voice, a newspaper for Irish Americans, Clinton has shown not only that he has a grasp of Irish issues, but that he can deliver on them. 'Under Clinton, Irish-Americans have been allowed and encouraged unprecedented access to key White House officials.' The visa decision brought to the surface British nervousness about Clinton's attitudes on Northern Ireland, particularly that the IRA was about to get a pat on the back. But the visa was never intended as an endorsement, nor did it turn out that way. So says Nancy Soderberg, a senior member of the US National Security Council, who helped persuade Clinton to grant it. Ms Soderberg is a self-assured, young political operator who, as a former foreign affairs adviser to Senator Ted Kennedy, spent years listening to the debate over Northern Ireland. She believes Clinton is committed to conflict resolution, as a facilitator rather than intervener. 'We wanted to expose Adams to American opinion that is opposed to violence and try to reach out in favour of moving the peace process forward,' she says. Clinton's record in conflict resolution elsewhere is not sparkling. But his aides believe a helping hand from the White House - drawing on the support of most of the 44m Irish-Americans - could bolster the Irish peace process, widely viewed as irreversible. The man who invited Mr Adams to the US, Bill Flyn, hardly fits the picture of the republican hard nut depicted by the British tabloid press. He is president of Mutual of America, one of the biggest insurance companies in the US, with offices on New York's Fifth Avenue, a prime mid-town location. Until seven years ago, Flyn, a third-generation Irish-American with a sentimental attachment to things Irish, steered clear of political involvement in Northern Ireland. Then one day, a group of IRA sympathisers from the Northern Aid Committee (Noraid) - the group once described by British and Irish authorities as the main vehicle in the US for funds and arms to the IRA - came to his offices and asked him to give to the Irish republican cause. 'I told them I couldn't do it. So they said: 'Now look here, Flyn, if you believe in a united Ireland, what the hell are you doing about it?' They made me feel like a draft dodger,' he recalls. So Flyn became involved not in Noraid but in the Northern Ireland Peace Movement, which is opposed to IRA violence. He subsequently joined a number of business groups which work closely with the British and Irish governments to promote a stable Northern Ireland through informal mediation and increased investment. His reaction to the Anglo-Irish joint declaration in December last year, which seeks to establish a basis for peace in the province, was enthusiastic. 'It was a fine declaration and I took my hat off to John Major and Reynolds. It was a breakthrough,' says Flyn. It was in this spirit that Flyn invited Adams in February to speak at a conference on the future of Northern Ireland - which sparked off the visa row. 'I wanted to help the process towards peace,' says Flyn. He believed then, and still believes, that far from promoting the IRA's armed struggle, the Adams visit strengthened the hand of moderates in the republic movement and exposed republican hardliners to the moderation of most Irish-Americans. He has no regrets about the invitation. Drawing on his contacts in the Irish republican movement, Flyn says: 'I think the Adams visit achieved more in 48 hours than 20 years of violence did. He realised that, if he was to make progress, it would have to be through dialogue and not through the bullet.' The majority of senators and congressmen who backed the Adams visa also say they did so not as a sign of support for IRA violence but to achieve peace. The group includes congressman Joseph Kennedy, nephew of former President Kennedy, son of former attorney-general Robert Kennedy, and a rising political star on Capitol Hill. Six years ago the young Kennedy's tour of Northern Ireland drew the wrath of the UK tabloid press when he got into an argument with a British soldier and told him to get out of the six counties. Kennedy, who represents Boston, which has one of the largest Irish communities in the US, is now defensive about his reputation as a leading critic of Britain's military presence in Northern Ireland. 'Whatever (sectors of the British media) may think, I am not pro-IRA,' he says. Despite his continuing sympathy with the republican ideal of a united Ireland, Kennedy says: 'I have never met with the IRA although I have urged them to lay down their arms. Given my family's history of assassination, how could I possibly condone the use of a gun to make a political point?' On the Hill, the one person who speaks out unflinchingly and often in defence of the IRA is Peter King, a Republican congressman for Nassau, New York state. The son of a New York policeman of Irish descent, King says he supports the IRA out of personal conviction, having been converted to the cause after Bloody Sunday in 1972, when British paratroopers shot dead 13 civilians in Northern Ireland. While King has few supporters among congressmen or in his constituency, he personifies a sentimental loyalty to the Irish republican cause as well as the anglophobia which dates from the 1840s, when the first flood of Irish immigrants came to America after the Irish famine. This patriotism - American-style - was once described by James Stephens, the Fenian leader, as a 'windbag or a phantom, the laughing stock of sensible men and the El Dorado of fools . . . speeches of bayonets, gala days and jolly nights, banners and sashes . . . bunkum and fulsome filibustering'. It sprang from ethnic insecurity and a sense of profound powerlessness as poor Catholic immigrants tried to forge an identity in a country settled by Puritan colonists. From the early 1970s, it became a source of funds and guns for the IRA as Irish-Americans, mindful of the civil liberties enshrined in the US constitution, protested against what they considered human rights violations against Northern Ireland's Catholic minority. One of the Irish-Americans deeply embedded in republican folklore is Michael Flannery, founder in 1969 of Noraid. Flannery fought in the IRA's North Tipperary brigade before emigrating to the US after partition in 1921. There, Flannery and a few friends set out to radicalise some of the social clubs catering for Irish expatriates. Today, aged 92, poor, lonely and suffering from arthritis, Flannery personifies the romance and the limitations of Irish republicanism in the US. He lives with his memories in Jackson Heights, a New York suburb where Irish Americans are now outnumbered by Latin Americans, and where drugs trafficking is more common than Irish republican propaganda. Flannery chuckles as he recalls how in 1982 he was acquitted of raising Dollars 16,800 for the purpose of supplying rifles to the IRA. The prosecution collapsed after defence lawyers uncovered potentially embarrassing connections between the arms dealers and the CIA. 'They never proved we were financing the IRA,' Flannery says. Flannery left Noraid in the late 1980s after the organisation split over whether Sinn Fein and the IRA should continue abstaining from politics in the south of Ireland. Those who remained in Noraid supported political involvement in the south, alongside armed struggle in the north. Flannery rejected political involvement. But he remains committed to the armed struggle as the means to achieve one state on the island of Ireland. Noraid's current chief, the much younger Martin Galvin, works from a lawyer's cramped office in New York's Bronx area. Galvin insists Flannery jumped ship unnecessarily. 'He thought we were going away from republican principles - that the armed struggle would be wound down. The last eight years have proved that these (fears) were not justified.' Yet Flannery is not alone in thinking that Noraid, for all its rhetoric, has gone 'soft'. The FBI and British intelligence believe Noraid's fund-raising abilities have diminished - down to less than Dollars 200,000 a year from close to Dollars 1m in the early 1980s. This is the result of splits in the movement, recession, FBI infiltration, and better information being made available about Northern Ireland. There is now evidence that Noraid no longer represents the hardest line among Irish-Americans. At a ticket-only banquet held by an offshoot of the organisation, called Friends of Irish Freedom, in South Boston this month, a keynote speech by Tommy McKearney, a former IRA member who served 15 years for shooting a British soldier, rejected the joint declaration outright. He was warmly received by 200 people from the Boston unit of the organisation when he said Gerry Adams should insist British troops got out of Northern Ireland before further negotiation, or hand over the Sinn Fein leadership to somebody else. Though the Friends represent only a small minority of Irish-Americans, they might be a source of support for a reconstituted armed struggle if some militant Irish republicans were to end violence in response to the joint decla-ration. Despite divisions among Irish republican supporters, US interest in Northern Ireland seems certain to increase in coming weeks. Bars in New York, Chicago and Boston are gearing up with sweat-shirts, stickers, baseball caps and advance block bookings for matches, as they await the arrival of the Irish World Cup football team and its supporters. The turn-out will represent the biggest single instance of Irish immigration, albeit temporary, since the famine. And some bars will, no doubt, be collecting for the IRA. The earlier Irish migration sprang from suffering and fostered a romantic sense of Irish history which militant republicans have been able to translate into money for guns. While those first Irish immigrants clambered on to American shores as supplicant refugees, today's festive Irish fans will find a community of Irish cousins who have themselves 'arrived' and are now finding their voice around a new US presidency. It is not the type of community in which the IRA can take for granted support for its campaign of violence. Numbering about five times as many Irish men and women as live in Ireland, north and south, the community's politics is informed by moderation. As Bill Flyn puts it: 'I think the real power of 44m Irish Americans has been awakened. It's available to anyone who wants to be a peacemaker.' Step up, President Clinton.

It shows a back view of British soldiers walking into the distance, past a signpost clearly marked 'London'. Seventy odd miles away is another mural, painted on the side of a house facing into the Shankill Road, a long finger of militant Protestantism thrust defiantly into Catholic west Belfast. It is literary rather than pictorial: '1969 IRA ran away. 1994 IRA surrendered.' So both sides have won. Or think they have. Or want you to think they have. Or are trying to convince themselves that they have. Or perhaps a mixture of all of the above. If there is one common feature which just now seems to unite almost all factions in both parts of Ireland, it is wishful thinking. Almost but not quite all factions - at least not if Dr Conor Cruise O'Brien, the former UN envoy and Irish cabinet minister, can be considered a faction. He greeted the IRA ceasefire on August 31 with a series of dire predictions in British newspapers, culminating in a chronology of disasters that included half a million refugees and 10,000 fatal casualties in a civil war ending 'in stalemate with a smaller but entirely Protestant Northern Ireland'; a military coup in Dublin; and explosions in several British cities - all by the end of 1995. I could not find anyone in Belfast or Dublin last week who would admit to believing in the whole of this scenario, but several people asked me what I thought of it, as though anxious to be reassured. In my turn I asked Mr John Bruton, leader of the main opposition party in Dublin, Fine Gael, what he thought. The nightmare was possible, he replied; but 'on average you don't have a nightmare every night. The likelihood is that it won't occur. The role of people like Dr Conor Cruise O'Brien is to prove themselves wrong by warning in time of the danger.' Many of the Northern Irish Protestants I met admitted to being more optimistic now than when the ceasefire was announced. The suspicion of a secret deal between the IRA and the British government has largely faded. Indeed, many express a degree of confidence in the British prime minister seldom heard on the mainland. His pledge of a referendum on any new arrangement for Northern Ireland is welcomed by unionists and generally believed. Even his rough treatment of the Reverend Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionist party, seems to have paid off: several Protestants expressed embarrassment about Mr Paisley's behaviour, while the only person who criticised Mr John Major's reaction was a southern Irish diplomat. There could, however, be a psychological explanation for this unexpected surge of unionist confidence in the British government. As Professor Paul Bew, a political scientist at Queen's University, pointed out: 'It's very uncomfortable for unionists to believe in a sell-out, because if you really did believe that you'd have to prepare for a very unpleasant conflict.' The fact is that IRA violence against British and Protestant targets has completely ceased since August 31, and that that is a great relief to the people. Mentally they remain on their guard, but emotionally they cannot help relaxing a bit. Obviously it is nicer to think this relaxation has a good chance of becoming permanent than to prepare for a reversion to violence and insecurity in weeks or months. The only thing unionists have ever had to hope for, all through the long years of violence, is that one day the IRA would realise the futility of the 'armed struggle'. Once they begin to think that that day might have arrived, the attraction of the thought becomes irresistible. But of course the thought has to be rationalised. Evidence of some sort has to be found. It is found, paradoxically, in the very success and publicity which the IRA's switch to a 'peace strategy' has enjoyed. Particularly for the Sinn Fein leaders, this conversion is seen as having produced such dividends in the shape of applause and respectability on both sides of the Atlantic that it seems hardly conceivable they would sacrifice it all by switching back to violence. I found many people disposed to take Mr Gerry Adams's statement to the Boston Herald last week at face value, when he said no one could guarantee 'two or three years up the road that if the causes of conflict aren't resolved another IRA leadership won't come along'. In other words, people accept that Mr Adams and his colleague, Mr Martin McGuinness, are now personally identified with the new strategy to the point where, for them at least, there is no going back. It was to see Mr McGuinness that I went to 'Free Derry'. Needless to say, he does not think the IRA has surrendered. Republicans, he said, were now 'totally and absolutely committed to the peace process', but their decision, which had 'totally transformed the situation on this island', was 'taken from a position of considerable strength'. Was there a danger that the 'peace process' could fail, I asked. Yes, he said. 'In Ireland there is danger all the time. But I am not in any way at all looking at this from a pessimistic point of view. We have a very real opportunity to resolve this conflict.' Permanent? 'Nothing in life is permanent,' said Mr McGuinness. It was all up to the British government. 'Since August 31 they have removed the broadcasting ban and reopened a handful of cross-border roads, while keeping the vast majority closed. Most people regard that as a measly response. There is a very real danger of the momentum being lost.' I asked what kind of solution to the conflict he envisaged. 'No party will go on record on its bottom line before a negotiation,' he replied. 'Of course our preferred solution is a unitary state, a united Ireland. Other parties to the negotiations will have a different view. But the key thing is acceptance by the British government that at some time in the future Britain will end its jurisdiction, even if that is some way down the road. When the British government accepts that inevitability, it will be a matter for all the Irish parties to work out the structures.' Slightly twisting the words of the Downing Street Declaration, Mr McGuinness claimed that document already contained 'a clear acceptance by the British government that the solution has to be an island-of-Ireland solution'. Britain, he said, had undertaken to 'facilitate' such a solution, but the onus was on it to go one step further and 'persuade' the unionists. 'Once the unionists accept that the British government is involved in a process of disengagement, it becomes a matter for the people of Ireland. Psychologically, once the British government makes it clear to the unionists, you're talking about a very fertile field.' The 'worst scenario', he conceded, 'would be that elements of unionism would try to rebel. In that case the British government should have the will to confront people who disrupt the process.' He brushed aside my suggestion that, having once agreed to withdraw, Britain would be more likely to get on and do so, leaving the Irish of all persuasions to fight it out. When I said that in the same declaration, Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, had agreed to give the majority in Northern Ireland the final say on sovereignty, Mr McGuinness replied: 'We would totally disagree with that.' Why, he asked, should 900,000 unionists have the right to overrule 600,000 nationalists in Northern Ireland, when 'on the island there are 3 1/2 m other people with a keen interest', not to mention 'many millions' in Britain itself who, he claimed, 'believe the British government should disengage'. 'It's not fair,' he concluded, 'to give the destiny of Ireland solely over to those 900,000 people, as opposed to the feelings and wishes of all the others.' Nor would he accept that in a united Ireland the northern Protestants would form a minority at least as disgruntled as the northern Catholics now are in the UK. 'Nothing could be further from the truth. Many political parties in the 26 counties (ie the south) are not too far distant from them: the Progressive Democrats, Fine Gael, the Democratic left.' Together with these allies, he suggested, the unionists might well form a government 'in a totally new Ireland'. He did not seem to realise that, if some unionists do regard the southern parties he named as allies, it is because those parties accept, more clearly and less equivocally than the Irish government, that Northern Irish Protestants have a distinct culture and history, and have the right to remain in the UK. But what, I asked, if Britain and the unionists are not so obliging? How long would the IRA tolerate a deadlock? 'I can't speak for them,' said Mr McGuinness coyly. 'But Sinn Fein is committed to the peace process. We shall be very disappointed if the British government doesn't speak with Sinn Fein very soon. The talks need to begin now.' On its side, the government's position is that 'exploratory' talks will be held within three months, after it has sufficient indications that the IRA intends the ceasefire to be permanent, and there has been 'a period of verification'. My impression is that the period of verification has already begun, and that the government is waiting less for a specific form of words from the IRA than for a feeling that unionist opinion is ready. Britain is certainly bothered, as is Mr Bruton in Dublin, by the fact that the IRA does not regard the 'cessation of violence' as affecting the methods it uses to enforce order within its own constituency. The only change is that the presumed delinquents' legs and arms are now broken with iron bars instead of their knee caps being shattered by a gunshot. These 'punishment beatings' are apparently popular in areas where the Royal Ulster Constabulary makes few attempts to deal with common law crime. But, as Mr Bruton said, 'an organisation that has to maintain that sort of intimidation in its own area cannot be said to be fully committed to democratic politics'. He professed to hope that his own government 'will put sufficient pressure on Sinn Fein to remedy those situations' - which sounds like more wishful thinking. Another area of uncertainty is the future of loyalist violence. Everyone tells you, including their quasi-official spokesman, Mr David Ervine, that the loyalists are 'close' to deciding on a ceasefire. But Mr Ervine added that they were held back by a 'lingering fear' that the Framework Document for new inter-party talks, on which London and Dublin are working, would contain 'something fearful for unionists' - meaning something that opens the way to Northern Ireland's detachment from the UK and its creeping annexation by Dublin. Mainstream unionists seem more confident that this will not be the case, pointing to the delay in producing the document (now expected in November) as evidence that London is resisting pressure from Dublin. The one thing that is certain is that no one in Northern Ireland will welcome the Framework Document when (or if) it does appear. It is bound to attract unionist suspicion, while falling short of even moderate nationalist hopes, let alone those expressed by Mr McGuinness. Moreover, as a spokesman for Mr John Hume's nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party candidly said, 'anybody welcoming it would be mad', since they would thereby give the other side a reason to reject it. Such is the nature of Northern Irish politics, which the non-violent parties and the British well understand. But the IRA and the loyalist paramilitaries have their own way of registering disappointment when something falls short of their expectations. The Framework Document will surely disappoint one of them, and probably both. At that point, some of Dr Conor Cruise O'Brien's nightmares may start coming true.

Officials said yesterday that a 'full debate' was anticipated on the peace process at the party conference, to be held in Dublin, and a definitive Sinn Fein response to the Downing Street declaration could not be ruled out - although it was 'unlikely in current circumstances'. The party's national executive has put forward an emergency motion welcoming the Irish government's approach to the Downing Street declaration and 'its positive and commonsense attitude to the need to provide clarification'. It calls on the British government 'to join the ranks of the persuaders' and reiterates Sinn Fein's demand for British clarification of the peace process. A Sinn Fein official said this would require face-to-face talks and for the British government to say whether it was considering an eventual withdrawal from Northern Ireland. Mr Danny Morrison, a senior IRA prisoner in the Maze prison in Northern Ireland, said that, if the British became 'persuaders' of unionists in the province 'to accept reconciliation with the rest of the Irish people,' this would result in a rethinking of the Republican movement's strategy. Other important issues to be debated at the conference are policy papers on the European Union and the economic effects of a united Ireland.   Countries:-  IEZ  Ireland, EC.

Mr Reynolds confirmed earlier that he would answer Mr  Adams's  request for clarification of the document he signed with Prime  Minister John Major in London last month.    But the Irish premier also made clear he could add little to  a series of public speeches he made about the peace initiative  and its aims.    Mr Reynolds has sought to spell out the aims of the joint  Anglo-Irish statement on a number of occasions in a bid to  provoke a positive response from the IRA and its Sinn Fein  allies.    So far, though, the hardline republican movement has  restricted itself to continuing consultations about the document  with its membership.    Sinn Fein-staged public meetings on the issue are set to  continue throughout Ireland until the middle of next month,  ahead of the party's annual conference in Dublin.    In his reply to Mr Adams -- who sent a similar letter to Mr  Major -- Mr Reynolds is understood to have spelled out the  consequences of an end to the IRA terror campaign.    This is thought to have centred on the timing of exploratory  talks with Sinn Fein as part of the political process bid to  resolve the issue of Northern Ireland.    Since the December 15 signing of the peace statement, Dublin  has been more willing than London to move towards clarification  of the document, while stopping well short of any form of  renegotiation.    But in Dublin on Friday [28 January], after a meeting of the  Anglo-Irish intergovernmental Northern Ireland Conference,  Ulster Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew appeared to suggest that he,  too, would clarify some of the issues.    Deputy Irish premier and Foreign Minister Dick Spring, who  jointly chaired the conference session, today said every  opportunity to spell out the aims of the peace declaration had  to be taken.    He believed all the neccessary clarification was in the  ""carefully and well-thought-out document,"" but stressed: ""We are  not going to foreclose on the prospect for peace on this island.""     "

Word of the meeting - which would be the first ever between a Provisional Sinn Fein leader and an Irish premier - came as Mr Adams extended his list of demands by calling in Dublin for the withdrawal of British troops from nationalist areas. In Washington senior members of the US Congress warned that no extra money was likely to be available this year to help smooth the way to peace in Northern Ireland. But Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, said after a meeting with President Bill Clinton in the holiday resort of Martha's Vineyard that he hoped 'substantial' sums would be forthcoming. As Downing Street continued to voice doubts about the permanency of the IRA ceasefire, republican leaders rejected the possibility of a violent reaction to the killing by loyalist paramilitaries of a Roman Catholic man on Thursday. Mr Martin McGuinness, a member of Sinn Fein's governing executive, said it was 'a total anathema to us that anyone would consider taking any sort of retaliation for the deeds of a few people within the unionist community'. Mr Michael Ancram, Northern Ireland minister, responded to Thursday's loyalist attacks by pledging that the government would 'continue to pursue those who commit crimes of this sort'. Mr Reynolds met yesterday with Mr John Alderdice, leader of the non-sectarian Alliance party, to discuss the setting up of the Irish government's Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, which is intended to include Sinn Fein for the first time in round-table talks with other political parties. Dublin hopes to establish the forum - which unionist parties are expected to boycott - before the end of October. Officials said Mr Reynolds would be anxious to 'get things moving' before departing on a visit to Australia in two weeks' time. They said a meeting with Mr Adams was 'inevitable' before he leaves. In the US, Senator Patrick Leahy, chairman of the Senate appropriations committee which controls overseas aid, said money to smooth the peace process was already in the pipeline for next year, in the form of the US's Dollars 20m (Pounds 13.3m) contribution to the International Fund for Ireland. Mr Clinton said the US was 'prepared to take some steps to do whatever we can to help'. In London, Downing Street said Mr John Major would study the report he had demanded into the transfer on Thursday of four republican prisoners from the mainland to jails in Northern Ireland over the weekend.

0,FT931-13926 ,"FT931-13926 _AN-DAUB6ABNFT 930121   FT  21 JAN 93 / Uphill steps towards consensus: An initiative to encourage compromise over the political future of Ulster      By JIMMY BURNS   TENTATIVE steps in search of a settlement in Northern Ireland were taken this week, not in the stately setting of Stormont or Dublin Castle, but in a rundown Belfast arts centre across the road from an office block that was bombed last year. An independent commission of inquiry chaired by Professor Torkel Opsahl, an international human rights lawyer, and made up of academics and former civil servants ranging from Mr Eamonn Gallagher, a former EC commissioner, to Lady Faulkner, the widow of the last Stormont prime minister, has held public hearings of a broad section of local opinion. The commission, funded by charities including the Joseph Rowntree Trust, is the idea of Initiative '92, a non-political group led by Mr Robin Wilson, a local journalist, and Professor Simon Lee, a law professor at Queen's University, Belfast. It arose out of frustration over the continuing absence of an agreement between the political parties and the persistent campaign of terrorist violence. Mr Wilson says it 'offers the best chance for an opening in the political logjam here'. Its aim is to encourage a climate of debate and tolerance while focusing people's minds on possible compromises. By early summer it intends to have distilled the mass of written and oral evidence it has received into proposals which might win popular acceptance. Unionist party leaders have accused the commission of setting out to undermine the political process, and have boycotted it. One leading Unionist called it an 'exercise by an upper-middle-class group of people who have played no active part in politics'. But Unionist councillors and other representatives of the Protestant community have taken part, and its apparent desire to make a constructive contribution has secured at least moral support for its endeavours from both London and Dublin. 'We are trying to bypass the otherwise insuperable barrier of waiting for a voluntary inter-party agreement. Proposals from the commission could catch the popular mind and provide something for the government to run with,' says Mr Wilson. The commission has got off to an encouraging start. Yesterday Lady Faulkner  -who seven years ago was a member of the BBC board of governors which blocked the screening of a documentary on terrorism - sat patiently listening to Mr Mitchel McLaughlin, chairman of Sinn Fein, which is banned from talks with the government. Lady Faulkner said before hearing Mr McLaughlin: 'If we are to produce something forward-looking, we can't have axes to grind. I feel that what we are seeing is a more realistic approach to the situation from both Protestant and Catholic communities than existed before.' Mr McLaughlin was only one of hundreds of individuals and organisations participating in the commission's proceedings. Some demonstrated a degree of tolerance which would have been unthinkable during the worst years of the troubles. Thus on Monday a Presbyterian moderator stood side-by-side with a community worker from the nationalist Falls Road area of Belfast whose son had been murdered by Loyalist paramilitaries and stated: 'We must work with models of co-operation and not of domination or assimilation.' Earlier Sir Kenneth Bloomfield, the former head of the Northern Ireland civil service, said he had detected less 'exclusiveness' among ordinary people. 'I think the situation is ripe to move forward.' Beyond good intentions, the commission faces an uphill struggle to draw up an agenda which might be of use to the politicians. The commissioners say the submissions display widespread disillusionment and apathy, while providing little sense of what alternative forms of government and constitutional changes may be needed. Where the submissions have been more illuminating is in identifying specific 'second-tier' policy measures which might create a better climate for future talks to succeed. There appears to be consensus in both communities on issues such as the need for a bill of rights, better integrated housing and education and more outside investment. Ms Marie Fitzduff, director of the Northern Ireland Community Relations Council, says the consensus reflects growing practical co-operation across the religious divide at grassroots level. And yet, as the 'revenge' shooting of a Catholic woman in Belfast this week showed, it will take more than the commission's efforts to appease the men of violence.

The proportion of hoteliers who were optimistic or very optimistic about the next three months rose to 80.5 per cent, compared with 73.8 per cent in the second quarter. The consulting group said the figures had been lifted by the ceasefire in Northern Ireland. All respondents to the survey in Northern Ireland said they were optimistic. More than three-quarters of UK hoteliers said they expected to increase their room rates in the next year. Most said their revenues were ahead of the same period last year, although 13.2 per cent said revenues had fallen. Business travel was the main reason for the revenue rise. Three-quarters of hoteliers said business travel revenues were higher than last year. Fewer than half reported a rise in revenues from leisure travellers. Staff numbers increased in 30.3 per cent of hotels in the third quarter but fell in 14.5 per cent. Although 31.2 per cent of hoteliers said they expected employee numbers to rise in the fourth quarter the proportion expecting to cut staff rose to 23.4 per cent.

After the weekend disclosure of fresh talks between Mr John Hume, the Social Democratic and Labour party leader, and Mr Gerry Adams of Sinn Fein, Downing Street flatly rejected any possibility that a revived Hume-Adams peace plan could form the basis for a political settlement. The prime minister's office dismissed speculation at the weekend that it might respond to a cessation of violence with an amnesty for IRA and loyalist terrorists. Downing Street said that since there were no 'political prisoners' in Northern Ireland, an amnesty would not arise. It declared that the presence and number of British troops in the province could not be a subject for negotiation. That was coupled with a strong reaffirmation that the government's 'constitutional guarantee' to the people of Northern Ireland meant that the democratic rights of the majority would never be prejudiced. Mr Major's determined move to reassure the Protestant majority - and above all Mr James Molyneaux's Ulster Unionists - followed signs in recent days of growing unease among moderate Unionists over the direction of the peace process. The leak of draft proposals from the Dublin government on its terms for a political settlement risked threatening the Ulster Unionists' acquiescence in Mr Major's negotiations with Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister. Mr Major is relying on the support of the nine Ulster Unionists MPs to get through controversial legislation at Westminster. The prime minister is also aware that without Mr Molyneaux's backing it will be impossible to secure an Ulster settlement. Officials said detailed British proposals for a new accord to replace the 1985 Anglo-Irish agreement fell far short of Dublin's call for a significant element of joint responsibility in the administration of the province, although it recognised Dublin's aspiration to a united Ireland. Downing Street said that Mr Major remained determined to press ahead with negotiations to secure a political settlement in close co-operation with Mr Reynolds. The Irish prime minister yesterday offered an upbeat assessment of the possibility of a permanent cessation of violence by the IRA and its loyalist counterparts. Mr Reynolds also distanced himself, though rather more gently than the British government, from the Hume-Adams initiative. However, the differences between the two leaders over the route to a settlement have been reflected in wrangling over the date of the planned Anglo-Irish summit in Dublin next month. Irish officials insisted the date had been set for December 3. But British officials suggested Mr Major thought more time might be needed to decide the framework for a political settlement. Officials said the government would review the number of troops needed in the province if there were a permanent cessation of violence.

He saw the document as comprehensive and positive and  believed it should enable the Ulster peace process to move  forward. The onus for creating peace in Northern Ireland was  firmly back with Sinn Fein and their IRA allies.    Deputy premier Dick Spring said: ""I welcome this document --  and Sinn Fein should, too. It has to potential to end the  logjam to the peace process thrown up by clarification.    ""There is a great deal of explanation that should be helpful  to Sinn Fein, and others as well.    ""I would hope that it provides that clarification that was  expected, and that the same consideration the British Government  gave the issue will now be given by Sinn Fein as quickly as  possible."" He described the document as ""a very serious  attempt...to answer the Sinn Fein questions."" He went on: ""The  leadership of Sinn Fein said they wanted matters clarified.  That challenge was taken up by the British Government. Matters  have now been clarified and that should put at end to that  particular debate."" Mr Spring stressed the British reply did  not amount to a negotation of the peace declaration.    A source close to the Reynolds government said: ""It is now  up  to Sinn Fein to decide what to do -- they have a choice.    ""They can decide to enter into the political process on the  basis of the peace declaration -- or continue with the  violence."" [passage omitted]    Ulster Unionist leader James Molyneaux said there was now no  excuse for the IRA to continue its campaign of violence. He  said the Government had to refute the allegations and innuendoes  which had been raised by the questions from Mr Adams. There  was now ""no room, no excuse, no justification for violence and  there is no need for any further clarification."" But he did not  think it would clear up the issue of clarification in the mind  of the Sinn Fein president. ""He will go on rabbiting on until  he devalues that device just as he has devalued the phoney  ceasefire.    ""He now has run his course, he will not now be able to say  to  America or any other nation that he is in any sort of puzzlement  or any misunderstanding about what was meant -- he has got it  all set out there.    ""I think it is a very good thing that the Government refuted  and rebutted all the monstrous assertions which appeared in Mr  Adams' paper because if that not been done it would have given  encouragement to republican terrorists and would have made the  law abiding people of Northern Ireland uneasy. Now it has all  been cleared up.""    The Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionist  Party, was outraged at the response.    He said the Government had produced a 14 paragraph  declaration and now a 20-page clarification.    ""The thing is not finished at all. It means the British  Government has been in cahoots with Dublin while Dublin is in  cahoots with the murderers."" And he accused the Government of  ""lying through its teeth"" about a border poll. It was only a  ""red herring"" which he claimed would be held only if it ran  concurrently with one in the Irish Republic.    Mark Dirkin, chairman of the nationalist Social Democratic  and Labour Party said: ""I would hope that people would find no  more need for clarification. I hope they come to that  conclusion by reading the paragraphs provided by the British  Government today.""    He said the SDLP [Social Democratic Labor Party] had always  encouraged Sinn Fein to accept the Downing Street Declaration  and continued to do so. [passage omitted]    Kevin McNamara, the shadow Northern Ireland Secretary, said:  ""The Labour Party for some time has called on Sinn Fein to  specify points of clarification and for the British Government  then to respond to such points.""    ""Sinn Fein can no longer use clarification as an excuse to  prolong their support for and justification of the use of  violence for political ends.    ""Sinn Fein must now renounce the use of force and enter  political negotiations to seek a just and lasting settlement on  the basis of Irish self determination as specificed in the  Downing Street declaration.""

The doorman was shot twice as he attempted to prevent two men from entering the Widow Scallan pub in central Dublin shortly before closing time. The pub is a well-known republican venue, and on Saturday night Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, was holding one of its regular fundraising events there in support of republican prisoners. Another man was shot in the neck after he had succeeded in slamming the door on the attackers, who fired through the door as they fled. They abandoned a holdall containing 18lbs of commercial explosive which failed to detonate. More than 200 people were packed into the pub at the time. A burnt-out car with Northern Ireland licence plates, believed by police to be the attackers' getaway car, was found in central Dublin shortly after the incident. In a statement released in Belfast the UVF said it had 'struck at the very heart of the republican movement in its own backyard'. It wanted to 'warn the IRA and the Dublin government that the Ulster people will neither be coerced or persuaded and will remain masters of their own destiny'. The UVF said it had now overcome the 'logistical setback' caused by the interception last year of a huge arms consignment destined for loyalist paramilitaries and had a new supply of explosives. The Dublin attack marks a dangerous escalation in the Northern Ireland conflict, and follows a week of sectarian killings in Ulster in which four Roman Catholic men were shot dead by loyalist paramilitaries, a part-time British soldier was abducted and killed by an IRA unit, and a cleaner at an RUC police station was killed by an IRA car bomb. Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, yesterday appealed for an end to tit-for-tat sectarian violence which he said was dragging the communities apart. 'Sooner or later it has to stop. Why not stop it now? Let's get on with working out an accommodation between the two communities (in Northern Ireland).' Mr John Hume, the leader of the mainly nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party, said yesterday: 'It is another piece of evidence that ever since peace started to really be on the agenda, there has been a clear escalation of loyalist violence. . . an obvious conclusion is that they don't want the IRA to stop.' Mr John Bruton, the leader of the opposition Fine Gael party in the Irish Republic, said the attack was designed to 'terrorise the people of the republic' and was being encouraged by efforts to open political contacts with the IRA. 'Any type of dialogue with an organisation which continues to use violence encourages imitators to bid for the same status,' he said. Loyalist paramilitaries have carried out attacks in the republic before, but these have mostly been confined to firebomb attacks on shops in the capital and in border towns.

Archbishop Robin Eames, the Church of Ireland primate, said the main Roman Catholic and Protestant churches wanted 'to be in the forefront of encouraging the political dialogue . . . now taking place and which we believe is the earnest desire of the vast majority of our people.' His call came as Unionist and nationalist political leaders completed another day of negotiations at Stormont, outside Belfast. Public comment was again limited to a brief agreed statement - probably a sign that the goodwill surround the deliberations remains largely intact. Four church leaders joined the prime minister in a meeting intended to show that Mr Major has put Northern Ireland high on his list of priorities. Besides archbishop Eames, he also met cardinal Cahal Daly, head of the Catholic Church in Ireland; Dr Rodney Sterritt, Presbyterian moderator; and the Rev Winston Good, Methodist president.

It proposes to double the sum to Pounds 1.26bn by adding contributions from the public and private sectors. The money, which has to be finally negotiated over the next six months, would go to Merseyside under the EC's Objective 1 status, which gives the poorest and most lagging areas special help. The EC is likely to press for the UK public and private sectors to give more than 50 per cent of the Pounds 1.26bn. The strategy document asking for the money is likely to raise doubts about whether Merseyside's decline can be reversed. Growth would have to be 5.4 percentage points a year above the EC average to reach average EC gross domestic product per head of population by the end of the century. This figure is thought unachievable by government ministers, civil servants and local authority leaders and officers. Even to reach 90 per cent of the EC average level, local growth would have to average 3 percentage points a year more than the rest of Europe. With an unemployment rate twice the UK's national average of about 10 per cent, about 6,600 jobs a year would have to created by 1999 to reduce the jobless total to UK average levels - and 8,400 jobs a year to reach the EC average. The hope is at least to halt decline and start the process of catching up. Merseyside appears to be falling behind faster than previously thought when Objective 1 status was first mooted earlier this year. Merseyside's per capita GDP is expected to have fallen to only 73 per cent of the EC average when the figures for 1992 appear. In 1982 the figure was 95 per cent. The region's population fell by 20 per cent to 1.37m between 1961 and 1991. The strategy document hopes the rate of exodus will decline, to give a stable population of 1.35m by 2001. No specific projects are suggested at this stage. Nearly 47 per cent of total spending would go on human resources, principally training. The Northern Ireland Office is to prioritise human resource development in its use of EC structural funds over the next six years, and emphasise the importance of cross-border links with the Irish Republic, Tim Coone writes. Northern Ireland's Objective 1 status for EC funds will entitle it to more than Pounds 950m for the years 1994-99. The office said there were three objectives: economic growth to achieve 'a meaningful degree of convergence' between Northern Ireland and the more successful regions of Europe'; promotion of internal cohesion by focusing on the development of human resources and reducing community divisions; and promotion of external cohesion to reduce the province's geographical isolation through improved transport and energy infrastructure. Spending will be allocated under seven sectoral programmes with human resource development taking the lion's share of 28.5 per cent of the funds.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

'Mayhew stays out of coalition crisis,' Mr Mayhew said, quoting an Irish newspaper headline. 'I wish we all had the same options,' Mr Spring replied. Mr Albert Reynolds, the prime minister, today addresses the Dail, the Irish parliament, where his Fianna Fail party is under attack from Mr Spring over the appointment of Mr Harry Whelehan, the Irish attorney-general, as president of the High Court. Mr Whelehan's mishandling of a child abuse case had already put pressure on the governing coalition of Fianna Fail and Mr Spring's Labour party. Mr Reynolds' decision last week to appoint Mr Whelehan as president of the High Court pushed the coalition to the brink of collapse. The common view yesterday was that whatever Mr Reynolds may say in the Dail, a deepening crisis can be averted only by the resignation of Mr Whelehan, which few observers think likely. If he stays, Ireland seems likely to have a new government - either through an election or a new alliance of parties in the Dail. For Northern protestants, there will be a certain irony if the Dublin government is to fall on this particular question - it concerns a warrant to have a Roman Catholic priest extradited by the Royal Ulster Constabulary from the republic. Few officials doubt that a period of political uncertainty will disrupt the peace process. All Ireland's political parties are committed to the search for peace but Fianna Fail, more than other parties, is rooted in the republican tradition - although it is said of Mr Reynolds that he carries the ideological baggage more lightly than earlier party leaders. Mr Reynolds has been pivotal in the peace effort - in particular his understanding with Mr John Hume, leader of Northern Ireland's moderate nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party, has provided a bridge to Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein leader. Under his leadership, the Irish government has been concerned to sustain the momentum of the peace process - sometimes provoking criticism that it was moving too quickly. There is as yet no pressure on Mr Reynolds's leadership within his party. Irish civil servants no doubt find it galling to be lectured about parliamentary democracy by the likes of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, which has voiced concern about possible disruption of the peace process by the coalition crisis. But if the callers to one Irish radio programme are any measure, many ordinary people are perplexed that the coalition should break down at this critical stage of the peace process - which comes at a time when progress is also being made on the economy and the legislative agenda. In seeking an explanation for the crisis, observers point to the personality of Mr Reynolds - an abrasive, instinctive politician, unusual in Ireland in being a successful self-made businessman, a petfood magnate and showband impresario. And as Ms Mary Harney, head of the Progressive Democrats, pointed out, Mr Reynolds has been here before. His attacks on Mr Des O'Malley, former PD leader, led to the break up of the Fianna Fail-PD government and triggered the general election in November 1992. Mr Martin McGuinness, Sinn Fein vice-president, said over the weekend that a change of government would be 'very, very unhelpful' and voiced misgivings about working with some of the other political parties which he accused of being 'less than helpful' in support of the peace effort. In particular, Sinn Fein has made clear its misgivings about working with Mr John Bruton, who since 1990 has been leader of Fine Gael, the main opposition party. A farmer, economist and barrister, Mr Bruton's spell as finance minister was marked by the pursuit of market-oriented economic policies. Mr Reynolds mistakenly referred to Mr Bruton as 'John Unionist' in an interview during the last election campaign. Fine Gael is a conservative party with largely middle-class support. Since the Fianna Fail-Labour coalition government was formed in January last year, it has had some internal difficulties, culminating in a leadership challenge to Mr Bruton in February. Sinn Fein must feel almost as uncomfortable about the prospect that one party which might have a role in forming a new government is the Democratic Left, a breakaway from the Workers party which itself was formed when the Official IRA broke ranks with the Provisionals in the 1970s. On current calculations, Labour could join forces with centre-right Fine Gael and the Democratic Left - with a total of 85 seats, such a coalition would have a narrow majority in the 166-seat house. If that fails to materialise, Fianna Fail could look for new partners, though after its unhappy alliances with PD and now Labour, the most likely candidates would be the Democratic Left or independents.

0,FT943-718 ,"FT943-718 _AN-EI1EIAB4FT 940928   FT  28 SEP 94 / MEPs back more funds for Ulster      By DAVID GARDNER   The European parliament yesterday voted for increased aid to help cement the peace process in Northern Ireland while giving a rare standing ovation to Mr John Hume, leader of the mainly Roman Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party. The move came as unionists - responding to a warning by Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, that the IRA might in time return to violence under a new leadership - urged the government to make the IRA hand in its guns. Mr Adams, visiting the US, tried to qualify his remarks, made in an interview with the Boston Herald newspaper. He said he had been speaking hypothetically and did not believe that the peace process would fail. Mr Hume said last night that he was 'absolutely certain that the Provisional IRA has totally ended its campaign. I have no doubt that the campaign has totally finished'. His reception was for his part in bringing about the IRA ceasefire. It also emerged that the dominant socialist group at the Strasbourg assembly intends to get the parliament to nominate the SDLP's lone MEP for the Nobel Peace Prize. The parliament voted overwhelmingly for more aid and a cessation of violence by all paramilitaries in the province in order to reach a settlement which 'must earn the allegiance and agreement of all traditions' in Ulster. The Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the hardline Democratic Unionist party and also an MEP, was the sole dissenting voice in the debate. He reminded the parliament that the IRA had still not agreed to a 'permanent' ceasefire, and that Mr Adams had warned of a return to violence in three years if the IRA 'does not obtain satisfaction'. The vote was carried by 380 votes to five but Mr Paisley's four apparent supporters later contacted the parliament authorities to say that they had inadvertently pressed the wrong voting button. Mr Peter Schmidhuber, European Union commissioner in charge of the budget, welcomed the parliament's backing for increased funding. He said the commission proposed raising the EU's contribution to the International Fund for Ireland from the Ecu15m (Pounds 11.8m) a year it has contributed since 1989 to Ecu20m. The EU has already allocated Ecu1.23bn in structural aid to Northern Ireland for 1994-99 - up from Ecu1.07bn in 1989-93 - to develop infrastructure, research and development, training and small businesses. The emphasis of yesterday's debate was less on numbers than on reconciliation. Mrs Glenys Kinnock, the prominent Labour Euro-MP, was behind the effort to nominate Mr Hume for a Nobel Prize, never previous-ly attempted by the parliament. She was firmly against any attempt to include Mr Adams in the nomination and said it 'would not be appropriate now' for the Sinn Fein leader to address the parliament. Meanwhile, Mr David Trimble, Ulster Unionist MP for Upper Bann, urged the government to insist on the dismantling of the IRA's military machine and the surrendering of its weapons before Sinn Fein was allowed into the peace process. Mr James Molyneaux, the UUP leader, said Mr Adams' comments were entirely predictable. 'It was always envisaged that they would eventually . . . drop dark hints on resuming violence,' he said.

The letter urging Mr John Major, the prime minister, to end the stalemate by meeting Sinn Fein to clarify the Downing Street declaration was delivered on the first day of the IRA's three-day ceasefire. A Downing Street spokesman reacted cautiously and said the government might respond to Mr Adam's request for talks, which the Sinn Fein leader says would be aimed exclusively at clarification and not negotiation, 'in the next day or two'. Earlier in the day, however, Downing Street had reiterated the government's position: 'We are not negotiating with them and we are not going to clarify the joint declaration. They know what needs to be done; a renunciation of violence.' Mr Tom Hartley, Sinn Fein national chairman, yesterday denied that his party was in contact with the government - in spite of suspicions on the subject expressed by some unionist politicians. He said he was not aware that any part of the republican movement was in contact with London. With an extension to the IRA ceasefire - due to end at midnight tomorrow - highly unlikely in the absence of a positive government response, prospects for a breakthrough remain slim. Security forces in the province remain on full alert, in spite of the temporary suspension of violence, and there are fears that the end of the ceasefire will be met by an upsurge in paramilitary activity by republicans and loyalists. Mr Hartley, who was in London to deliver Mr Adams' letter, urged Mr Major to give an 'imaginative response' to what he described as an 'unprecedented initiative' by the IRA which demonstrated republican readiness to be flexible in the search for peace. He criticised the government's refusal to talk to Sinn Fein, given its readiness to do so from mid 1990 until late last year. 'When we raised points for clarification then, we got them very easily,' he said. 'It does seem odd the British are now saying 'no' at a time when there is a real possibility of political movement and a momentum being created.' Ms Lucilita Bhreatnach, Sinn Fein general secretary, said that Dublin had provided satisfactory clarification of the Downing Street document - but that ambiguities and uncertainties remained which London had to clear up. She declined to be more specific, saying it would be 'unhelpful' at this stage. Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, yesterday used a visit to Canada to deliver an upbeat message on the prospects for peace. He also reiterated the government's view that political violence had 'no place' in a democracy. In a speech at Montreal-based Bombardier Aerospace - owner of Short Brothers, Ulster's largest manufacturing employer - Sir Patrick said the Downing Street declaration would do much to bring about an end to terrorist violence. The people of Northern Ireland, like those of the Republic, rejected the concept of a three-day 'abstention from political violence'. Focusing principally on inward investment, Sir Patrick said that Ulster had accounted for 14 per cent of all new investment into the UK in 1992-93 in spite of having only 2.8 per cent of the population. Overseas investors recognised the 'essential normality' of conditions in Northern Ireland, he said.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P9721 International Affairs.

They say Britain, by propounding such a claim, thinks it can  ruin relations between Iran and Europe.    International relations analyst Farhad Azimi, in his  interview on Wednesday, says that by alleging an Iranian link to  the Northern Ireland issue, London intends to give plausibility  to its age-old hostile propaganda against Islamic Iran.    ""Prime Minister John Major would do better to realize the  realities in Iran and discontinue London's efforts at  antagonizing Europe with Iran, and watch out against playing  into the hands of certain notorious elements,"" he added.    According to Azimi, the Islamic Republic must revise its  relations with those governments that are unable to realize the  factual realities in Iran.    College professor and Britain-watcher Dr. Reza Farahmandi  told IRNA today that since the triumph of the Islamic  revolution, the British Government has consistently pursued a  fraudulent policy in its dealings with Iran.    He said British arms sales to Iraq during the almost eight  years of the Iraqi war (1980-88) against Iran, Britain's aids to  the terrorist grouplets with the idea of them subverting the  Iranian Government as well as the recent voicing of such  irrelevant claims as Iran having collaborated with the Irish  Republican Army (IRA) are all typical examples of Britain's  schemes for waging a political war with the Islamic republic.    ""The triumph of the Islamic revolution in Iran in 1979 in  fact ended the history of foreign domination in Iran as well as  any cause for succumbing to any foreign pressure for yielding to  external threats,"" he added.    Dr. Farahmandi said another goal behind the scheme is for  the  British Government to divert attention from the shabby state of  affairs at home and direct public attention outside of England.    He commented that Iran's lobbying at international forums  for  the aggressed people of Bosnia-Herzegovina and its exposure of  grim realities about the discriminative polices of Britain,  Europe and the U.S. against the continent's native Muslim  population, has raised doubts about London's claims of  commitment to human rights and other international conventions  that disallow the massacre of innocent people of whatsoever  religious faith, origin and race.

0,FT921-8911 ,"FT921-8911 _AN-CBNB3AEQFT 920214   FT  14 FEB 92 / Unemployment increase largest in the south      By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff   THE RATE of job losses appears to be increasing, according to unemployment figures released yesterday. Last month more than half the people losing their jobs were in the south-east, the south-west and East Anglia - the regions hardest hit by unemployment in the past two years. That has largely been due to cuts in service industries - the dominant employers in the three regions. Seasonally adjusted un-employment last month stood at 2,604,000, a rise of 53,000 from December. That followed a revised unemployment rise in December of 36,200, and came after several months in which job losses appeared to have slowed. In the three months to January the average monthly rise in the jobless total was 43,300, the highest figure since September last year. In the three months to December the comparable number was 31,300. The headline, or unadjusted, figure in January was 2,673,864, which is 122,000 above the previous month. Since March 1990, when unemployment started rising at around the start of the recession, 1,027,299 people have lost their jobs. Adjusted for seasonal variations, the figure is 997,500. The south-east including London suffered 20,700 job losses in December. That increased the unemployment rate, measured as a proportion of the workforce, by 0.2 of a percentage point to 8.3 per cent. The rates in the south-west and East Anglia both rose by 0.3 of a percentage point, to 8.7 per cent and 7.0 per cent respectively. Since March 1990 unemployment in the south-east has increased by 128 per cent. The other two regions have each seen jobless totals more than double. Over the same period other parts of Britain - which suffered big increases in un-employment in the early 1980s and have relatively large concentrations of manufacturing industry - have suffered less from unemployment. Northern Ireland, which has 14.3 per cent of its workforce unemployed, has seen its unemployment total increase by just 5 per cent since March 1990. Over the 22 months the difference between the unemployment rates in the south-east and Northern Ireland has narrowed from 10.5 percentage points to 6 percentage points. In line with the reduction in inflationary pressures across the economy, the index of average earnings for manufacturing rose in the 12 months to December by 7 3/4 per cent on an underlying basis. In November the rise was 8 per cent. The comparable increase for service industries was 7 per cent, down from 7 1/4 per cent in November. Last month's large increase in joblessness appears to have been partly due to a slackening in recruitment. That may have been reflected by the 229,800 people leaving the government's unemployment register in January, the lowest monthly figure for a year.

Analysts will be interested in the degree of increased competition in the UK from overseas companies, and the performance of new products such as novelty booths, providing photos with celebrities such as Madonna. Tomorrow, Eurocamp, the camping holiday company floated in July 1991, is forecast to reveal pre-tax profits for the year to October of about Pounds 9.4m, up from Pounds 8.2m. Lower interest payments, increased demand and broader markets - especially Germany and the Netherlands - all lie behind the rise. Yorkshire Tyne-Tees, the merged ITV company, should announce pre-tax profits of about Pounds 17.5m for the year to September, with two months included from Tyne Tees. This would be a little below original estimates of about Pounds 19m, but still a solid base to begin tackling its new franchise. Anxiety about the preference dividend at Kunick, the fruit machines to nursing homes group, seems set to prove unfounded at the announcement of the annual results on Wednesday. The recent sale of 50 per cent of the nursing homes business, reducing debt, should allow both a preference and a nominal ordinary dividend. Forecasts are for a pre-tax loss of about Pounds 3.5m, after some Pounds 6m of exceptionals, against a profit of Pounds 12.4m. The seasonality of Park Food Group's main business (selling Christmas hampers) means it regularly reports pre-tax losses at the interim stage. A smaller first-half deficit is expected to be announced on Friday, down from Pounds 4.4m to Pounds 4m, For the full 12 months, forecasts of Pounds 9m pre-tax, compared with Pounds 6.9m last year, are being revised upwards.

0,FT944-2978 ,"FT944-2978 _AN-ELOCSAENFT 941215   FT  15 DEC 94 / Leading Article: Beyond the Troubles   There is a danger that the success of this week's investment conference in Northern Ireland will be measured in pounds and pence. The long list of aid pledges recorded over the past few days are welcome injections to the region, that will be easily spent. Yet the biggest obstacle to economic success in Ulster has never been a shortage of public funds. Rather, it has been a lack of confidence in the future, born of the Troubles, and shared by residents and foreign investors alike. Overcoming that lack of faith would be the true peace dividend. On that score alone, the conference may have made a lasting contribution to the region's future. Delegates heard much of the tax and other incentives aimed at attracting inward investors to the province. But there are more fundamental attractions to a peaceful Northern Ireland. Property prices are the lowest in the UK, as are labour costs, and the workforce is well-educated. A few investors have already begun to exploit these benefits. But there will need to be many more if the economy is to rid itself of the distortions created by the last 25 years. Economic activity is heavily skewed towards agriculture, declining industries and the public sector. None of these offers a very promising launch pad for peacetime growth. The prime minister, Mr John Major, has rightly promised that security expenditure savings will not be lost to the region altogether, but ploughed back into health and education spending. Altering the composition of public spending to favour teachers and doctors over policeman may create more public jobs than it destroys. Yet the long-term aim of subsidies from the centre - currently around half of the region's budget, or a quarter of GDP - must now be to give people a better opportunity to fend for themselves in the private sector. Over a third of the workforce is currently employed by the government. Even this degree of public job creation has not prevented the region from having the highest unemployment rate in the UK, with more than half of the total being long-term unemployment. Joblessness afflicts Catholics particularly. Some 43 per cent of 20- to 60-year-old Catholic men are currently without work, compared with a 26 per cent non-employment rate among Protestants. Mr Major announced further measures to tackle the problem in yesterday's speech. But there is a strong case for doing more. Those at the periphery of the UK have long resented being used as guinea pigs for potentially unpopular new government policies. Using Northern Ireland as a testing ground for ambitious employment policies which went beyond the timid measures announced in last month's budget would make a welcome change. With luck, enhanced inward investment flows, tighter transport and other links with the south, and a better tourism trade will eventually provide jobs for the unemployed to go to. This week's conference may make employers take a look. The trick will be giving them the confidence to stay.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

0,FT942-8507 ,"FT942-8507 _AN-EETCSAB1FT 940520   FT  20 MAY 94 / Government treads fine line on Sinn Fein queries      By DAVID OWEN   Early reaction to last night's government comments on Sinn Fein's questions suggested that London had successfully trodden the fine line between responding to genuine republican queries on the Downing Street Declaration and not being lured into arm's-length negotiations. The only jarring note in a chorus of positive or neutral remarks came from the Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the hardline Democratic Unionist party, which has put opposition to the declaration at the heart of its European election campaign. Mr Paisley accused the government of being 'in cahoots with Dublin while Dublin is in cahoots with the murderers'. He was sick of the 'lying duplicity' and arrogance of the government which had taken time to write a 20-page 'love letter' to Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president. But Mr James Molyneaux, the Ulster Unionist party leader, was much more positive, saying it was 'a very good thing that the government refuted and rebutted all the monstrous assertions which appeared in Mr Adams's paper.' He added: 'If that not been done it would have given encouragement to republican terrorists and would have made the law-abiding people of Northern Ireland uneasy. Now it has all been cleared up.' There was 'no room, no excuse, no justification for violence and there is no need for any further clarification,' Mr Molyneaux said. But he predicted Mr Adams would 'go on rabbiting on until he devalues that device just as he has devalued the phoney ceasefire.' Mr David Trimble, the UUP MP for Upper Bann, called for political talks on the province's future to resume as soon as possible. 'There is going to be no change in government policy,' he said. 'There is nothing new in it.' Mr Seamus Mallon, deputy leader of the mainly Roman Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party, said the government was 'right to answer so straightforwardly, comprehensively and honestly'. He added: 'It was not a fudge nor was it a brush-off. The ball is very firmly in the court of Sinn Fein. A line is drawn in the sand. The reality is that they must make up their minds.' Mr Kevin McNamara, the shadow Northern Ireland secretary, said: 'Sinn Fein can no longer use clarification as an excuse to prolong their support for and justification of the use of violence for political ends.' 'Sinn Fein must now renounce the use of force and enter political negotiations to seek a just and lasting settlement on the basis of Irish self-determination as specified in the Downing Street Declaration.' Lord Holme, Liberal Democrat Northern Ireland spokesman, called on Sinn Fein to call an immediate end to violence and said the IRA's support deserved to 'dwindle even further if they procrastinate another day'. In addition to answering one of the questions directly (see left), the government spelt out a number of points more clearly than it has before. First, it stated categorically that 'acceptance of the joint declaration is not a precondition for entering the talks process.' Downing Street had edged towards clarifying this point earlier in the week, saying an end to the IRA's armed campaign was the 'primordial' requirement for Sinn Fein to enter political talks. Second, it emphasised that 'no political objective could properly be excluded from discussion in the talks process.' Third, it said that 'a lasting and general peace would render military operations in support of the police no longer necessary'. Whether the exercise is judged ultimately to be a success now depends on the republican response. If it did decide to throw down its arms, the IRA would face the difficult task of explaining why it had pressed on with its campaign over the five months since December for the sake of one direct clarification and a few supplementary comments. London last night appeared to recognise this when it said there was 'no conceivable justification for continuing to rob people of their lives, least of all a call for a textual explanation of the joint declaration'. But Sinn Fein's guarded initial reaction suggested it at least welcomed London's decision to take genuine queries over the joint declaration's meaning seriously. The ball is back in their court.

0,FT934-10104 ,"FT934-10104 _AN-DKGAGAFVFT 931106   FT  06 NOV 93 / As They Say in Europe: Just another Irish bomb      By JAMES MORGAN   THE UK chamber of horrors has re-opened an occasional European debate. Britain's reputation for extreme inequality and social brutalism co-exists with the continuing, unexpected image of a land of honesty and justice. But there is no challenger to the reputation of Ulster and Liverpool as western Europe's worst places. They are why British lectures about the deficiencies of the social chapter in the Maastricht treaty fall on cynical ears. The Irish atrocities provoked the greatest concern in most European papers but the trial of two 11-year-old Liverpool boys, accused at Preston crown court of murdering a two-year old, aroused greater interest in France. The contrasting attitudes towards Britain were reflected graphically. La Depeche du Midi wrote: 'There is, in fact, something radically new in the crime being judged today in Preston. A threshold has been crossed, a taboo overturned and an image shattered . . . A rich western society trying in all circumstances to save its children from violence. Violence strikes in the third world suburbs of Liverpool and thereby marks, in one bloody symbol, the end of our cosy blindness.' At the other end of the country, however, Paris-Normandie wrote that the British, like others, found it hard to accept that children could be murderers because 'we wish to believe man has a future and that youth, more than any other age group, carries the hope of a better world . . . British justice is confronted with a basic problem. The mere fact that it is dealing with it arouses and deserves the respect of everyone.' The Ulster killings made the front pages almost everywhere else (but not more than the death of the Italian film director, Federico Fellini). Editorials abounded in Germany, but they were always short. Only the Mitteldeutsche Zeitung made what one might have thought the obvious point on November 1: 'The insanity is unbelievable: on the one hand, the EC in Brussels celebrates the growing unity of Europe; on the other, people are being killed under the screen of Christianity in one of the countries with the greatest future in this Europe.' The last phrase might surprise some readers: the German romantic attachment to those of opposite temperament is often overlooked. Only one Bonn paper observed that Ulster's atrocities would not be permitted to continue if they took place on the British mainland. The Neue Zurcher Zeitung wrote: 'Northern Ireland society has . . . stepped over an invisible frontier, but nobody knows what lies on the other side. Either the wilful and macabre shedding of blood has reached saturation level and will lead to a readiness to compromise, with both sides giving up their ideals, or despair will take over.' The two sides in Northern Ireland are treated like terrible natural disasters with no great causes at stake. The terms 'Protestant' and 'Catholic' are the norm, alongside ritual denials that the troubles are based primarily on religion. Since 'Unionist' and 'republican' are not susceptible to concise translation, the full political dimension is hard for continental readers to grasp. In Ireland itself, though, it is different. After the Shankill Road bomb which killed 10 (Protestant) people, the Limerick Leader wrote a letter to a nine-year old boy, Darren Baird, who lost his mother, father and sister. 'The culprits claim to represent Irish republicanism  - and, to our shame, many of us, by our silence, have lent credibility to that falsehood . . . many of us are so sick at what has happened this past quarter of a century that we are sorely tempted to reject republicanism, even of the constitutional kind. Truth to tell, many of us could no longer care less what colour the flag flying over Belfast is. Thanks to the Provos, the stage has now been reached where, rather than re-uniting the north, more and more southerners would gladly cut it adrift.' It has taken 25 years to reach a conclusion that seems like a cliche everywhere else. For many commentators, Northern Ireland already is a place cut adrift. But the human tragedy is not the whole story. The British government spends twice as much per head in the province as it does on the mainland. This adds Pounds 3bn to its budget deficit, supplemented by another Pounds 480m in security costs. And the province, year after year, eats up four times as much, relatively, in European farm subsidies as the rest of the country. On the Continent, there is scarcely any backgrounding or analysis of events in Northern Ireland, in contrast with the attention devoted to the former Yugoslavia. Stories are usually dropped - 'It's just another bomb.' The Irish problem is nearly as complex as Bosnia, but more boring and far more manageable. Perhaps in Britain, too, it is understood less well because few think it worth understanding. James Morgan is the economics correspondent of the BBC World Service.

Evidence from British intelligence that the organisation has sustained a capacity to resume military operations has reinforced Mr John Major's cautious response to the ceasefire. It coincides with growing anger in Belfast about a spate of 'punishment shootings' by the IRA in nationalist areas since the ceasefire declaration. The IRA has also continued actively to operate the criminal 'racketeering' from which it derives much of its finance. Taken alongside uncompromising comments from Mr Gerry Adams and Mr Martin McGuinness, the leading figures in Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, the intelligence has dampened hopes of an imminent breakthrough to pave the way for direct talks between the London government and Sinn Fein. Mr Adams warned this week on his high-profile tour of the US of a possible resurgence of violence if progress towards a political settlement were to reach deadlock. Mr McGuinness said he would never use the word 'permanent' to describe the ceasefire. Despite the two men's insistence they have no direct links with the IRA, British ministers insist both are on the organisation's ruling Army Council. Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, reported to the cabinet yesterday on the latest developments in the province, but a substantive review of Sinn Fein's position will not take place until after Mr Adams's US tour. In the meantime there is little prospect of any further gesture by the UK government in the direction of Sinn Fein - such as the lifting of the exclusion order which bars Mr Adams from mainland Britain. Whitehall officials stress that they do not believe that the latest developments necessarily mark a retreat by the IRA from last month's announcement. The socialist group in the European Parliament yesterday nominated Mr John Hume, leader of the mainly Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party, for the Nobel Peace Prize. Dr John Alderdice, leader of the non-sectarian Alliance party yesterday had a meeting with Mr Major, in which he urged the prime minister to open direct contacts with the IRA if Sinn Fein leaders persisted in saying they could not speak for the paramilitaries. The purpose of these contacts would be to discuss the handover of IRA weapons.   Countries:-  IEZ  Ireland, EC.     GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P8651 Political Organizations.

'There must be a peace dividend in Ireland for peace to succeed,' Mr Clinton said in a White House ceremony to announce the appointment. Although the appointment marks to some degree a larger US role in the search for peace in Northern Ireland, US officials insisted that they were not directly involved in the peace process and were concentrating only on the economic aspects. Mr Clinton's election campaign promise to appoint a peace envoy caused considerable friction with the British government before it was shelved. Mr Mitchell, who did not run for re-election in last month's congressional elections, will step down as leader of the Senate Democratic majority when the new Congress is installed in January. His appointment will take effect on January 10. Although Mr Mitchell's father was the son of Irish immigrants, his more publicised root has generally been his mother's Lebanese origins. A former judge with a keen legal mind, studiously even-tempered manner and unrelenting tenacity, Mr Mitchell has been wooed for a wide range of far more prominent jobs. Mr Clinton tried to persuade him to accept a seat on the Supreme Court earlier this year but Mr Mitchell preferred to press for health care reform before he stepped down from the Senate. He remains a popular choice to become commissioner of baseball.   Countries:-  USZ  United States of America.   Industries:-  P9199 General Government, NEC.   Types:-  PEOP  Appointments.

At the same time, officials were desperately trying to limit the damage to British interests caused by the almost unchallenged 48-hour access to the US media which the Sinn Fein president had. The government was unable, however, to conceal its dismay at President Bill Clinton's decision to issue a visa for Mr Adams. Publicly, Downing Street put a brave face on the affair. A senior official said the UK/US relationship was 'alive and well and extremely vigorous'. In private, ministers and senior officials were bitterly disappointed at President Clinton's decision to overrule his most senior advisers. One senior minister said the president seemed to have put UK/US relations and the future of the Northern Ireland peace initiative at risk to placate the Irish lobby in the US. The government was also upset by the largely sympathetic coverage given to Mr Adams by the US media, and the lack of interest in balancing comments from Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary. A Downing Street official said Mr Hurd was 'pushed off the networks by programmers who decided that Gerry Adams is more interesting'. The bitterness in London was not eased by a broad hint from Mr Raymond Seitz, US ambassador to London, that he advised Mr Clinton not to allow Mr Adams into the US. Mr Seitz did not dispute a suggestion that he argued against giving Mr Adams the chance to capture US media attention. Mr Seitz was called to Downing Street for talks on Tuesday as part of a drive to persuade Mr Clinton to distance himself from Sinn Fein. The British position was also put to Mr Al Gore, the US vice-president, by Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, and by Sir Robin Renwick, British ambassador to Washington. Downing Street said the flurry of diplomatic activity had borne fruit in Mr Clinton's statement on Tuesday which supported the British/Irish joint declaration on Northern Ireland and abandoned the idea of a US 'peace envoy' to Belfast. Officials vehemently denied suggestions that Britain lost the propaganda war in the US because it was caught unprepared by Mr Clinton's decision to grant a visa to Mr Adams.

The issue price of 400p on the 7.57m new shares represents a 13 per cent discount on yesterday's average trading price of 460p. The issue is being underwritten by AIB Capital Markets. Proceeds will be used to finance the building of a new ferry to operate on the Dublin-Holyhead route, which will replace a chartered vessel with one with more than twice the capacity. The company said that capacity constraints on the route had created opportunities for expansion to 'capture a significant portion of the freight transport originating in the Republic of Ireland currently being routed through Northern Ireland ports'. The annual financing costs of the new ferry would be no greater than the chartering costs of the existing chartered ferry, the company said. The Irish Sea routes have become increasingly competitive. The port of Larne, north of Belfast, with its short sea crossing to Britain and frequent sailings schedule, has posed a challenge to operators out of ports in the Republic.

Although some of these investments have been in the pipeline for some time, their announcement - timed to coincide with the conference - served to underline the forum's success. The organiser, the Industrial Development Board for Northern Ireland, said it was well pleased with the event. More than 300 delegates attended, including a large delegation from the US accompanying Mr Ron Brown, the country's secretary for commerce, who addressed the conference. The investments confirmed yesterday were: Du Pont of the US is spending Pounds 13.5m on developing prototype technologies at its Lycra facility in Londonderry, bringing its investment in research there to Pounds 38m in the past three years. Du Pont employs 1,000 production staff in Londonderry. Ford, the US motor group, which has had a presence in Belfast for 30 years, is to invest Pounds 15m in the production of new engine components. Nacco Materials Handling of the US will be investing Pounds 11m at Craigavon, consolidating the plant's position as a source for its new range of Hyster and Yale forklift trucks. More than 100 extra jobs will be created by 1996. British Telecommunications is to invest Pounds 30m in a new office block at Laganside in Belfast and a further Pounds 1.5m in expanding its customer services centre at Enniskillen, providing 113 new jobs. Sir Iain Vallance, BT chairman, said the investment would be in addition to the Pounds 30m BT expects to invest in Northern Ireland in the coming year. Fujitsu, the Japanese electronics group, which is already established in County Antrim, is to build a Pounds 3.5m factory at Springvale Business Park in west Belfast which could create 100 new jobs. A shadow hanging over the conference in the shape of a possible boycott by Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, evaporated when Sinn Fein councillors arrived at the Europa Hotel early yesterday morning and began to lobby delegates over the province's economic future. They subsequently took seats in the conference hall and listened to some of the speeches before walking out. One potential US investor, however, criticised the treatment of Sinn Fein. Mr Alan Hevesi, the New York City comptroller - who controls a Dollars 50bn (Pounds 30.4bn) pension fund - said that Mr Gerry Adams, the president of Sinn Fein, should have been invited to the conference. He said that exclusion of 'a representation of a substantial portion of the population' from the conference was 'a mistake on the part of the British government'. After the conference Mr Major visited the site of the new BT office block in Laganside. He later went with his wife Norma to the centre of Portadown, which was devastated 19 months ago by an IRA bomb. The Majors were given a warm welcome as they walked through the central shopping district. They then visited the local Royal Ulster Constabulary headquarters.

Mr Reynolds will indicate to his British counterpart, during a planned one-hour meeting in Downing Street, that Dublin is likely to make clear its own ideas on the north-south relationship within about a month. This month Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, gave Dublin a check-list of outline proposals for renewed talks aimed at a settlement and asked for the republic's response. Today's meeting comes a week before Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, holds its annual conference near Dublin. With signs that the Irish government remains more optimistic than London of a positive response to the peace proposals, Mr Reynolds is expected to urge Mr Major to be cautious in his efforts to step up pressure on Sinn Fein to renounce violence and take a place at the negotiating table. Downing Street was yesterday playing down the significance of the meeting, saying that no formal statement was expected. One official said it could be seen as 'a visible demonstration of the desire of both governments to be relentless in putting pressure on Sinn Fein and the IRA to declare their hands'. Mr Reynolds is keen to give the meeting more prominence however, and has interviews planned later with the media at the Irish embassy in London after the England and Ireland rugby match. There appears to be a conviction in Dublin that, while a breakthrough may not be imminent, there are nevertheless indications that an IRA ceasefire may be forthcoming soon. Significantly, it is the belief at the highest levels in the Irish government that Sinn Fein and the seven-man army council of the IRA are willing to accept the joint declaration. Last week Mr Reynolds responded by letter to Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, for his request for 'clarifications' of the joint declaration. There have since been further communications via intermediaries, and according to officials in the republican movement Sinn Fein views the Irish government's stance positively. The problem appears to be that lower echelons in the IRA are not willing to go along with the declaration and a permanent ceasefire without further assurances from the British government.

0,FT944-1524 ,"FT944-1524 _AN-ELTDSABYFT 941220   FT  20 DEC 94 / Bomb find poses fresh threat to peace process      By JOHN MURRAY BROWN      BELFAST   The Northern Ireland peace process appeared to be in danger of stalling yesterday, with republicans forced on the defensive after the discovery of a bomb in County Fermanagh. It is the first such incident since the IRA ceasefire three months ago. An explosive device containing 2lb of Semtex explosive was discovered in a furniture store in Enniskillen. The IRA, in a short statement yesterday, denied responsibility for planting it. The possibility that the Irish government would reverse its decision to place a block on the pre-Christmas early release of IRA prisoners was last night thought to depend on whether the IRA denial was accepted by Dublin. The new justice minister, Ms Nora Owen, said she hoped to make a statement in the next few days. The find overshadowed yesterday's second session of exploratory talks between British officials and Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing. It will underscore British demands to see the issue of the decommissioning of arms and explosives resolved before Sinn Fein is invited to engage in full political talks with the government and other constitutional parties. The issue is likely to be high on the agenda at today's meeting between Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, and Mr John Bruton, the new prime minister of the Irish Republic. The find is the first evidence of the use of Semtex since the IRA ceasefire at the beginning of September. The IRA is the only paramilitary organisation believed to possess such material. Mr Martin McGuinness, who led the five-strong Sinn Fein delegation at yesterday's talks, refused to condemn the action. He said: 'It was an incident of no great significance, and it certainly won't affect the peace process.' He suggested the incident might have been part of a 'dirty tricks operation' designed to implicate republicans in violence. Mr Michael Ancram, Northern Ireland political affairs minister, expressed disappointment that Sinn Fein, as a democratic party, had declined to condemn the action. He said Sinn Fein had requested a further meeting in January. Mr Ken Maginnis, the Ulster Unionist MP, described the attempted bombing as 'a carefully orchestrated IRA operation to intimidate the British government into agreeing unjustified concessions'. Mr Bruton, speaking in Dublin before leaving for today's talks in London, said he was 'saddened' by the incident, but he stressed there were 'certain unusual aspects of the incident, which made it unclear who was involved'.

The council's autumn review of the province's economy, which was published yesterday and prepared after the IRA ceasefire on August 31 but before the loyalist cessation, warns of short-term adjustment problems associated with the peace process that will have to be handled 'carefully, sensitively and gradually'. The report says: 'It is important to stress that in the short-term transitional period it is the composition of public expenditure that should change rather than its overall level.' With some local economists concerned that the Treasury is keen to see cuts in the wake of the ceasefire, the review provides support to those opposed to public spending cuts. The NIEC stresses that, with the state accounting for 35 per cent of those in employment, subventions - government subsidies - are 'the most significant determinant of demand in the economy'. The report says that government funding, which is planned at Pounds 7.4bn in 1994-95, helped to damp the recession in a province with the highest number of long-term unemployed. Citing the example of the police and prison services, where employment levels are three times higher than in other UK regions, the council says the peace process calls for redeployment of personnel and the reallocation of public spending towards 'more constructive' economic use. It says: 'Peace, as well as conflict, involves difficult economic adjustment problems. These, however, have to be handled with care and in a sensitive manner to ensure that the 'peace process' is moved forwards rather than backwards.' The NIEC also voices support for the controversial issue of greater north-south economic links, through increased cross-border trade, a more fully integrated island economy and improved policy co-ordination in areas such as energy and transport. The extent of any new all-Ireland institutions is a central issue in the negotiations between London and Dublin on the proposed framework document, which will provide the basis for planned all-party talks on the new political arrangements for the province. London is aware of unionist sensitivity on the issue, however, and is anxious that Irish moves to provide these bodies with executive powers are not seen as a dilution of British sovereignty.

After a day of emergency meetings in Belfast, at which politicians, army and security chiefs tried to assess the impact of the accident, Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland Secretary, stressed that the tragedy would not undermine the government's anti-terrorism drive. Sir Patrick said the accident, on the slopes of the 1,405ft Beinn na Lice on the Mull of Kintyre, was 'a dreadful and tragic event'. However, he emphasised that the 'operational effects' of the crash would be overcome. Mr John Major, prime minister, said those killed would be replaced and the work of the security forces would continue. Among the victims of the crash were Assistant Chief Constable Brian Fitzsimons, head of the RUC special branch, and Colonel Chris Biles, the most senior army officer to be killed while serving in Northern Ireland. Also on the flight were nine other senior and middle-ranking special branch officers, six Northern Ireland Office officials - including members of MI5 - and eight senior military intelligence officers. Four crew members also died. A senior Stormont official with security responsibilities said: 'It is a terrible blow at a time when we have a clear, upper hand. We will double efforts to demonstrate that we intend to stay on top.' Sir Hugh Annesley, Royal Ulster Constabulary Chief Constable, said the crash was as 'a catastrophic loss'. Despite the blow to morale in the security forces, officials believe any disruption to anti-terrorist operations will be short-lived and that the IRA is unlikely to benefit from the setback. Security chiefs have ruled out the possibility that the Chinook fell victim to sabotage. Among the most likely reasons for Thursday's disaster - which happened as the helicopter took its passengers to a security conference in Inverness - are mechanical failure or the poor flying conditions at the time. The aircraft, which had recently been refurbished by Boeing, the helicopter's manufacturers, with new avionics, engines, transmission systems and rotor blades, was not fitted with all-weather radar or a 'black box' flight recorder. Last night Labour challenged the decision to allow a large number of top-rank security personnel to travel together. Dr John Reid, Labour armed forces spokesman, said he hoped the decision was not affected by financial considerations. Dr David Clark, Labour's defence spokesman, claimed there was 'a shortage of helicopters' and that to save money the government delayed ordering new ones. Sir Patrick defended the practice of allowing so many senior personnel on one flight as 'quite normal'. One senior anti-terrorist source said such flights were judged to run the least risk of successful attack by the IRA. Inquiries into the crash will be conducted by the Department of Trade and Industry's air accidents investigation branch, Strathclyde police and by the RAF for the defence ministry.

It scores one definitive hit, yet also includes an abysmal miss. The rest is in between. This mix, along with its topicality, makes it a piece to be seen. Paddywack is the most sympathetic work about Irish republicanism that I have come across on stage. Damien, a young Northern Irishman looking for a job in London, is suspected by his fellow lodgers of working for the IRA. Damien does not deny the suspicion, nor does he overtly confirm it. Instead he puts a thought of his own. 'Why is it,' he says after a spate of London bombings, 'that the only question the British ever ask is how he (the bomber) managed it, and not why he bothered to do it in the first place?' Touche. No-one in the Kilburn lodging house even attempts an answer. Clearly the IRA has still some residual sympathy in Northern Ireland which the British fail to understand. This sympathy may fall short of approving the violence, but it does not run to denouncing it: certainly not in front of the British. Yet Magee has a prejudice of his own. This is his manifest belief that, as a result of the IRA bombings, the British have become more anti-Irish than ever. I know of no evidence for this view. On the contrary, respect for the Irish Republic has grown: British impatience is with the more intransigent leaders of the Ulster Unionists; the IRA is a phenomenon to be contained and, if necessary, lived with. The British tolerance of the disruptions caused by the IRA is remarkable. Magee plainly disagrees with that analysis. He thinks that the average Brit regards 'Paddys' with contempt. 'Paddybashing' was a term coined by British troops in Northern Ireland in the 1970s. It was meant to be a joke. Some of the Irish took it literally, and that is perhaps the republicans' problem. They take themselves over-seriously: more people, especially Irish people, ought to poke fun at them. Paddywack goes some of the way. Irish republicans, Magee suggests, can be more racist than the British. Since there are very few blacks in Ireland, the Irish do not have to live with the problems of a multi-ethnic society. Magee also has a go at an English middle class woman who romanticises violence and a middle class male intellectual whose liberal principles collapse when he is sexually betrayed. Since much of the drama depends on suspense - whether or not Damien is an IRA activist - I shall not give away the plot. On the first night, the direction by Michael Latimer looked a shade under-rehearsed. But it should pick up speed and the subject is electric. James Nesbitt is a quizzical Damien who maintains the suspense till the end. Holly Aird's Annette, the girl who falls for him, is the essence of some female English liberals.

We have  been working with the British Government in the context of the  Downing Street-Northern Ireland peace declaration to bring about  a permanent cessation of violence, and that is not happening.""  Unless there is a permanent cessation of violence there cannont  be any negotation between Sinn Fein and either government.''    Mr. Spring, also the Irish Foreign Minister, said the best  chance of progress might now lie with the communities of  Northern Ireland: ""If people can see over three days what  happens without it, they can convince the men of violence it  should come to an end.""    Irish Goverment aides made it clear that Dublin felt there  was little more they could now do in response to last night's  IRA statement.    Andrew Hunter, chairman of the Tory backbench Northern  Ireland committee, said: ""We're not interested in ceasefires...I  don't think that a tactical pause in murder is something to be  welcomed.""    Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams said the IRA move  ""represents  an important initiative"" and urged Mr. Major to authorise  immediate talks with his party.    Ken Maginnis, Ulster Unionist MP for Fermanagh and South  Tyrone, said: ""This is a tactic that has to do with placing the  IRA and Sinn Fein in a stronger position than they are presently  in.""    John Hume, leader of the nationalist SDLP, said: ""It's a  very  risky road but it's a worthwhile road if the ultimate objective  is a total cessation of violence and therefore no stone should  left unturned.""    Prime Minister Albert Reynolds called it ""a very small step  in the right direction.""     "
0,FT944-5903 ,"FT944-5903 _AN-ELAD8AEIFT 941201   FT  01 DEC 94 / Contacts with IRA reopened after Newry killing      By DAVID OWEN, JIMMY BURNS and Our Belfast Correspondent   The British government reopened secret contacts with the IRA last month after the killing of a Newry postal worker in a raid by republican gunmen. This emerged yesterday as the government looked poised to send a letter to Sinn Fein indicating its readiness to begin preliminary talks with the IRA's political wing before Christmas. These are now thought likely to start either on December 12 or December 16. Sir John Wheeler, Northern Ireland security minister, said he had no doubt exploratory talks would begin 'within a few days'. The government has also promised to start preliminary dialogue with loyalist representatives by the end of the year. It is understood that the government contacted republican leaders immediately after the Newry murder to demand in the strongest terms an explanation for what happened. The demand brought an admission from the republicans that they did not know what had prompted the raid and that they were trying to find out. The government then sent a second message demanding firm answers. The exchange underlines how close the killing - the first since the IRA and loyalist paramilitaries declared ceasefires - came to derailing the peace process. Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, initially accused the Royal Ulster Constabulary of trying to damage the process by blaming republicans for the shooting. But the IRA later acknowledged its members were responsible. Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, said on the day of the killing on November 10 he was 'deeply angered' by the 'callous and wicked' murder. The next day he stressed the peace process was 'on course'. It is believed the secret contacts may have been initiated by Downing Street but were probably carried out by MI5. A Downing Street official said yesterday he had seen 'no evidence' such contacts had taken place. Yesterday's developments came as Mr Adams said the government had reopened its secret contacts with Sinn Fein to advise it to expect a date shortly for exploratory talks. Earlier Mr Adams and Mr John Hume, leader of the mainly Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party, issued their first joint statement since the IRA ceasefire. They urged the government to be more positive in its attitude to the peace process. Mr Adams has also been invited by Mr Anthony Lake, President Bill Clinton's national security adviser, to meet him at the White House next week to discuss ways of advancing the peace process.

But he did not deny that an indication to that effect might  have been given to Mr Martin McGuinness of Sinn Fein at an  unauthorised meeting. The government has acknowledged that two  unauthorised meetings did take place.    Sir Patrick's comments came before a BBC TV programme last  night which claimed a government representative had told Mr  McGuinness at a meeting three days after last year's Warrington  bombing that Britain's long-term intention was to pull out.    Speaking in Northern Ireland, Sir Patrick said: ""Nobody has  ever been authorised to say on behalf of the British government  that the British government intends to withdraw from Northern  Ireland.""    A previously released Sinn Fein account of the meeting --  said to have taken place on March 23 last year -- made no  reference to a signal from the British representative that  Britain might withdraw.    Sinn Fein's account does refer to remarks by the  representative to the effect that ""the final solution is union.""    The representative said that Sir Patrick wanted Sinn Fein to  play a part in achieving a settlement for the province ""not  because he likes Sinn Fein but because it cannot work without  them.""    ""Any settlement not involving all of the people North and  South won't work,"" Sinn Fein's note added.     "

The British  presence in Ireland in incompatible with peace."" Would you  choose the same words again today?    [Adams] Of course, I would. Almost every day one can see  the failure of British politics in Ireland and the frustrated  experiment of division. The division did not work in Germany,  or anywhere else for that matter; certainly not here.    [Alioth] But the Unionist majority in Northern Ireland has  conclusively proven over the past 100 years that it will defy  any solution it does not like, even through the use of force.  Do you really want a united Ireland with 1 million alienated  rebels?    [Adams] One must take into account that the Unionists have  never stood on their own feet, but have always been dependent on  the British. When this state was founded, it was not the  Unionists, but the British who founded it. Consequently, we  Republicans demand that the Unionists stand on their own feet.  The Ireland that we want is not the exclusive miniature state  that we have here in the north, but a comprehensive one, in  which we will replace the terms Catholic and Protestant by  generally accepted civil rights of the island of Ireland on the  basis of equality. This requires the participation of the  Unionists.    [Alioth] In your view, what would change politically and in  everyday life if, tomorrow, the IRA were to publicly renounce  the use of violence?    [Adams] First of all, I regard it as most unlikely that the  IRA will do it. In a conflict one either beats the other side  or reaches a negotiated settlement. The British have admitted  that they are not able to beat the IRA militarily, and during  the past 15 years I have said that this is not a military  problem, which is where there cannot be a military solution, but  that there has to be a political solution. Last year, Sinn Fein  participated in a number of political initiatives, all of which  were aiming at a peace agreement, a negotiated settlement. We  talked to the British Government, there was the initiative  between me and Mr. Hume from the Social Democratic and Labour  Party [SDLP], and we met church leaders and other opinion  leaders in all of Ireland. We reached agreement among Northern  Irish Nationalists, which was supported by the government in  Dublin, and of which the IRA said that it might be a basis for  peace. All that led to the Downing Street Declaration of 15  December 1993, which was described by the British Government as  a first step toward a peaceful settlement. Therefore, it seems  quite unlikely to me that the IRA -- and neither the British or  the Loyalists -- might take unilateral action. The inner logic  of the situation and the development of the past 14 months point  to a multilateral negotiated settlement. Such a solution was  delayed and stopped in the past three, four months and has to be  followed up quickly now. This process will at one point lead to  a demilitarization, that is to say an end to armed activities  from all groups involved, including the IRA. This would, of  course, be a major step ahead, because we would thus be moving  toward a political solution.    [Alioth] In your opinion, what are the political  consequences of the IRA killing yet another policeman in  Northern Ireland?    [Adams] Meanwhile it sounds almost banal, like a cliche: I  think that, in this situation any casualty has to be regretted.  Every single casualty victim, whether it is a Royal Ulster  Constabulary [RUC] officer, a British soldier, or, as quite  recently, alleged members of Loyalist organizations, is  regrettable. We need demilitarization; this is something I have  always worked for. I have asked all parties involved to lay  down their arms -- the IRA, the British, the Loyalists. And I  have not changed my position. Last week we had the death of  Theresa Clinton, the wife of a Sinn Fein member; there were a  number of attacks against Catholics and the homes of Catholics.  The IRA killed a RUC man. And most recently, the IRA killed two  people, claiming that they were Loyalists. The families of all  these victims will feel exactly the same: pain. One could say  that Theresa Clinton had nothing to do with all that. She was a  woman, it was hard luck that she was married to a Republican,  while the RUC man was a responsible, armed voluntary member of  the British Armed Forces, and so on. Yet, I do not think that  such qualifications and half-justifications will bring things  ahead. We must make sure that the chances for peace are not  wasted. Whatever the justification or the circumstances of the  conflict up to the winter of 1993 may have been, in a situation  in which all sides claim to have the solution it is disgusting  that people keep getting killed.    [Alioth] Did you ever consider that the strategy of the IRA  and Sinn Fein of the past 20 years might have been  counterproductive; that Irish unity was delayed through people  becoming alienated with one another within Northern Ireland, and  the North becoming estranged from the South?    [Adams] It has not delayed unification of Ireland, which  would not even be on the agenda without the fight here in the  north. Yet, certain aspects of the IRA campaign were certainly  counterproductive, there can be no doubt. And the lasting --  let us say -- violence is repulsive to the people who live in  the middle of it here, as it is to outside observers. The  sooner armed activities cease, the sooner we will enter a  nonviolent phase of the struggle, which will be all the better  for all parties involved.    [Alioth] What to you tell people who claim that, after 20  years in the political desert, the Republicans had lost the  ability to evaluate their opponents' political room to maneuver.    [Adams] But that is certainly not the case. The mere fact  that the peace process exists at all, and that expectations have  been so high, prove the Republicans' readiness for dialogue with  their opponents, even with their enemies.    [Alioth] In the last five months you constantly asked the  British Government for ""clarification"" of the Downing Street  Declaration. Is this not simply a trick to press for a meeting  with a British negotiator before the IRA renounces the use of  force?    [Adams] Well, the term trick is quite an unlucky word in  this connection. Sinn Fein runs in the election, Sinn Fein wins  a seat. In the last municipal election we won 12.5 percent of  the vote, every third Nationalist supports our party. We are  the party that gets the most votes in Belfast, the country's  second biggest city, and we are the second biggest party in  Derry and elsewhere in the six counties. It is not a trick to  try and win a mandate, to get it, and then represent those from  one received this mandate. I think that this is called  democracy. The other parties asked for clarification and, quite  correctly, got it. Every party did, sometimes even from Dublin  and London. After all, it is our duty first of all to find out  what the declaration is all about, because it can be -- and that  is probably the intention behind it -- interpreted differently.  I did not say anything about it in the past 10 days, and I am  become sick only when I hear the word ""clarification."" I think  that we are now in a crisis. When the British stonewall, reject  any development, then everything will freeze, the Loyalists will  step up their murderous campaign, the British will intensify  military occupation. At Easter, the IRA suspended its  activities for a few days to support a clarification. This was  at a time when the Republicans were trying to be flexible and  facilitate demilitarization, while what we have got is  militarization. Then the IRA will, of course, take action  again, and we are finding ourselves in the situation in which  the entire peace process threatens to disintegrate.    [Alioth] Sometimes you give the impression that you would  like to be more peaceful and conciliatory than you turn out to  be.    [Adams] I would be a fool if I were not seeking peace. All  of us, our children, our neighbors, have the desire to live in  relative peace. I have lived in this conflict all my life.  This is why I think that my longing for peace is maybe greater  than that of others who do not live here. It is easy to make  peace with friends, but it is absolutely difficult to do so with  enemies. I am not interested in a temporary or partial peace.  What we need -- and I am deliberately using the term -- is  lasting peace, a lasting solution. I am convinced that we will  get peace. I am convinced that the entire thrust of the fight  points toward peace. Things are going too slowly, and it is  frustrating to me that we have once more become hostages of the  right wing of the British Conservatives, and that Mr. Major is  prevented from providing clarifications to Sinn Fein. As far as  I am concerned this is unbearable. We have to be patient and  hold out. If John Major did not have his internal difficulties,  how much further would he have gotten? All this indicates that  a more stable British Government would deal with these central  problems more comprehensively than has been the case in the  past. The Republicans have always started from the assumption  that the British will only consider the democratic option  reluctantly, only when every other way out is blocked.     "

The decision emerged yesterday as cabinet ministers involved in the Northern Ireland peace process met in London for the first time since the collapse of the Dublin coalition. The move reinforced the mounting impression at Whitehall that preliminary talks between the government and Sinn Fein are unlikely to start before the conference, which will be held on December 13 and 14 and is to be launched by Mr John Major, the prime minister. The Northern Ireland Office denied that yesterday's decision had any bearing on the starting date for the talks, which the government has promised would begin before Christmas. But Sinn Fein attacked the move, saying it was 'another stalling tactic by the British government in its efforts to reduce the momentum of the peace process'. Meeting at Downing Street, ministers are understood to have discussed both the prospect of talks with Sinn Fein and progress on the so-called UK-Irish framework document which will form the basis for future talks involving Ulster's main political parties. Senior civil servants have continued to make headway on the document in spite of the power vacuum in Dublin. But they are understood to have gone as far as possible with-out further ministerial guidance. Three main sticking points remain: Article two of the Irish Republic's constitution, enshrining Dublin's territorial claim over the province. The so-called 'European dimension' dealing with how relations between the north and south of the island and the rest of Europe are handled. The so-called 'default mechanism' dealing with the handling of reservations about decisions made by the planned Ulster assembly. Dublin is understood to have argued that this mechanism should take the form of a joint committee of the Anglo-Irish conference. London wants both governments to be able to examine such reservations separately. Meanwhile in Dublin, another adjournment of the Irish Republic's parliament seems likely today with political parties still unable to agree terms for a new coalition in the wake of the collapse of the 22-month Fianna Fail and Labour government and the resignation of Mr Albert Reynolds as prime minister. Fianna Fail, the largest partner in the outgoing government, last night seemed close to initiating formal negotiations with Labour. However Mr Bertie Ahern, Fianna Fail leader, is coming under pressure from within his party to take a tough line with Labour.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

0,FT944-16258 ,"FT944-16258 _AN-EJND7ACEFT 941014   FT  14 OCT 94 / The Loyalist Ceasefire: Milestone on the long road to a lasting settlement      By DAVID OWEN   The announcement yesterday of an open-ended loyalist ceasefire was, as Mr John Major said, 'unalloyed good news'. It was widely recognised that the immensely difficult task of forging a durable political settlement in Northern Ireland would be almost impossible unless talks could take place in an atmosphere of peace. Now another big part of the jigsaw has fallen into place. In the words of Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister: 'What is most significant now is we are going to be having negotiations without the fear of violence in the background.' But it would almost certainly be a mistake to anticipate that progress towards agreement on Ulster's future will be anything other than slow and fitful in view of the gulf still separating some of the main protagonists. Many unionists remain convinced that reform can be limited to setting up a devolved assembly with narrowly defined powers. That is a million miles from Sinn Fein's perception of the eventual outcome. As one participant said yesterday: 'Somebody is being deceived in this process.' In view of the caution underlying London's welcome of yesterday's announcement, what looks set to happen next is a relatively brief period of stocktaking. The loyalists' assertion that the 'permanence of our ceasefire will be completely dependent upon the continued cessation of all nationalist/republican violence' will be used to increase the pressure on republican leaders to make clear that their ceasefire is for good. Mr Michael Mates, the former Northern Ireland minister, says the loyalists' decision to emphasise that they will not return to arms unless republicans do likewise means that 'another of the IRA's fig-leaves has been shed'. Mr Mates believes that no unionist 'of any shade' would be prepared to sit down with republican leaders until the question of permanence is resolved. Unionists are also expected to be quick to emphasise that armed republican splinter groups such as the INLA have yet to say that they have laid down their arms. But there are strong signs that the government may shortly adjust its stance on the six-week-old IRA ceasefire in recognition of the fact that it may never be given a pledge that it is permanent. The idea that London should open a 'reversible' dialogue with the IRA's political wing will be considered by Mr Major and cabinet colleagues next week. A staged response - perhaps lifting the exclusion orders on prominent Sinn Fein members first then reopening indirect contacts - would allow the government to be seen to be responding positively while maintaining the option of withdrawing contacts. Until now, the government's position has been that it would start a preliminary dialogue with republican leaders within three months of a permanent end to IRA violence. Public confirmation of any adjustment in the government's position could come in a Commons debate pencilled in for October 26. There is also thought to be a strong likelihood of a summit meeting soon between Mr Major and Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister Mr Reynolds is keen for Sinn Fein to be brought into the political process as soon as possible via his proposed Forum for Peace and Reconciliation. There have recently been signs that this may be delayed until early next month. Once preliminary dialogue starts - which ministers have acknowledged could be under way by Christmas - the focus will quickly move to the question of the paramilitaries' willingness to hand in their weapons. Once again, few believe that these negotiations would be anything other than long-drawn-out and complex. One potential complication about the IRA's weapons arsenals is that a significant proportion of their arms is thought to be stored in the Irish Republic. Moderate unionists would not insist on the surrender of every gun, but they will almost certainly be extremely reluctant to allow Sinn Fein into the full-fledged political talks process until all heavy weapons had been handed in. Another important detail will be whether representatives of the loyalist paramilitaries will be admitted to these talks and, if so, how they are to be represented - bearing in mind that loyalist terror groups are banned. Commenting on this yesterday, Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, said: 'They are very, very anxious that their own political anxieties, their political concerns, should be heeded, should be expressed. Therefore, once we are satisfied that this is for real, we shall want to be considering with them and with other people ways by which it should be possible for their anxieties to be met.' As for the political talks themselves, expectations of when London and Dublin's much-delayed framework document will be published now vary from early next month to not until next year. This should provide a clearer view of what London and Dublin see as the options for developing north-south relations. It should also provide a clear insight into the vital question of whether Dublin is prepared to amend the articles of its constitution enshrining its territorial claim over the province, in return for a commitment by London to amend the 1920 Government of Ireland Act. Bilateral discussions involving the province's constitutional parties on the shape of Ulster's future government are also carrying on, amid signs that Rev Ian Paisley's hardline Democratic Unionist party is considering ending its boycott.

0,FT942-7418 ,"FT942-7418 _AN-EEYDRAGRFT 940525   FT  25 MAY 94 / Survey of Ireland (1): Goal is to be on the fast track to EMU - As recession lifts, Ireland is in a good position to take advantage of the upswing      By TIM COONE   When the Channel Tunnel linking Britain and France was officially inaugurated earlier this month, most Irish newspapers were quick to note that Ireland was now the only EU nation without a land-link to the rest of the member states. They lamented the fact that the tunnel would reinforce Ireland's isolation and warned that Irish goods would find it more difficult to compete with British ones in Europe's populous heartland. What good are Irish Oscars, Booker Prizes and successes in the Eurovision song contest if they do not produce jobs, they asked? Although Ireland has had some outstanding successes in stealing the European limelight in music, literature and film over the past year, the frustration of not being closer to the economic and political pulse of Europe is strongly felt. As the European parliamentary elections approach, there are no powerful Euro-sceptic lobbies or irate backbenchers berating the government for wanting to be in the fast track to European monetary union (EMU). That goal is a cross-party objective. But Irish fears of economic isolation are perhaps overstated. As the clouds of recession show signs of breaking up, the country appears to be better positioned than many of its EU partners to take advantage of the upswing. The Fianna Fail-Labour coalition, now in its second year, has maintained the central thrust of the economic policy pursued by two previous governments since 1987 - reduction in the debt/GNP ratio and securing price stability. A measure of that policy's success is that inflation in 1993 fell to 1.5 per cent, one of the lowest in the EU. The crisis in the European exchange rate mechanism towards the end of 1992, putting pressure on several European currencies including the British pound, forced the incoming coalition government to accept a 10 per cent devaluation of the punt within weeks of taking office. Despite the turbulence at the time, this has had a salutary effect. Interest rates are now at record lows and heading lower; foreign currency reserves are higher than before the crisis; exports look likely to hit record new levels and consumer demand is showing strong signs of recovery. The fiscal deficit is well under control - Mr Bertie Ahern, the finance minister, felt confident enough to give away IPounds 333m in tax reliefs to the lower-paid in last January's budget, equivalent to 1.1 per cent of GNP. Indeed, the budget's underlying assumption of a 3.8 per cent growth rate in GNP this year is now looking conservative. The latest spate of economic forecasts from independent analysts put the figure closer to 5 per cent, a level which is expected to be sustained up to the end of the century. On that basis, the current budget deficit will be eliminated by 1996, and the EMU target of reducing the debt/GDP ratio to 60 per cent appears attainable by the end of the decade. Provided that inflation is not stoked up again, Ireland has thus positioned itself well to take the fast track to Europe. Yet there remains a fundamental problem at the heart of economic policy-making, as Mr Han de Jong, chief economist at Goodbody, Dublin stockbrokers, points out: 'In conducting exchange rate policy, the authorities are using a basket of currencies with sterling and the DM as heavyweights. The foreign exchange market, on the other hand, has effectively relinked the punt to sterling . . . the perceived poor quality of economic policy-making in the UK is the core of the problem for the Irish authorities and constitutes the paradox of Irish policy intentions,' he said. While the Irish authorities want Ireland to be among the first to participate in monetary union, they are being held hostage to the political fortunes of a UK Conservative party in disarray over Europe. According to Mr de Jong: 'UK politics is a constant potential threat to (economic) stability.' In other economic policy-making areas - notably the deregulation of state enterprises - Irish freedom of action is subject to internal rather than external constraints, but still the process has had successes. Aer Lingus, the state-run airline, has managed to emerge from a big restructuring, aimed at returning it to profitability, without a crippling labour dispute. Unions at An Post, the state postal service, have accepted radical changes to work practices. Both companies are searching for overseas partners. The rail unions are proving more reluctant to accept change at Iarnrod Eireann (Irish Rail), the heaviest government loss-maker, but as practically all of Europe's railways are heavily subsidised, most of the attention will now focus on Telecom Eireann, the state telecommunications company, and on whether a proposed link-up with British telecommunications group, Cable  Wireless, will get the go-ahead from the government. Telecom unions have indicated that they will support a joint venture with a foreign partner - but are opposed to one with Cable  Wireless. The importance of telecommunications to the economy cannot be over-estimated. Over the past 10 years Ireland's telecommunications services have improved dramatically. The recent entry of competitors into the international segment of the market is rapidly bringing down the cost of calls, adding to the continuing tax attractions of setting up business in Ireland, not least in the financial service industries. More than 150 offshore funds totalling some Dollars 9bn are now managed out of the International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) in Dublin, a sector which has grown rapidly in the past two years. A growing number of funds is also being listed on the Dublin stock exchange, which itself is attracting an increasing amount of overseas attention. Inward industrial investment is also continuing to notch up successes. Several new projects - in the health care sector, in telemarketing and in electronics, among others - have been announced since the beginning of the year. (Generous grants and a low tax regime have helped to attract these, despite intense competition from, for example, Scotland and Wales.) Ireland's profile - and its hopes of attracting further investment in both manufacturing and services - will be raised further next month when its team travels to the US to play in the finals of football's world cup in Orlando and New York, accompanied by tens of thousands of supporters. A flood of Italian tourists to Ireland followed Ireland's participation in the 1990 World Cup in Italy. A similar effect is hoped for in the US, traditionally Ireland's main overseas tourist market. An increase in numbers from the US will be especially welcome in the west of Ireland, which is having to come to terms with the reform of the EU's common agricultural policy. This is forcing change in the traditional dairy and beef farming sectors in favour of new industries such as tourism and forestry. Planting of new woodlands and forests has accelerated in the past five years, encouraged by generous grants and incentives which are scheduled to be increased again soon. A forest products industry is already undergoing expansion. This is expected to be as important to the economy, in 20 years, as the food industry is now. So Ireland's position at the edge of Europe is not the disadvantage it is frequently made out to be. Its comparative advantages have been recognised and economic and political stability is fostering a positive climate for inward investment by companies positioning themselves for growth in the European market. Much more would be possible, too, given a satisfactory resolution of the island of Ireland's most intractable problem - Northern Ireland, an issue which has absorbed large amounts of ministerial time over the past year. While prospects for peace in the province have come tantalisingly closer than at any time in the past 25 years, as a result of talks with the UK government leading up to the Downing Street Declaration, the government has had to accept that its suggestion last year that 'peace by Christmas' was possible was wide of the mark. It may be some way down the road yet. Nevertheless, even on this issue, there are signs of the same movement, which, in other areas, is leading to hopes of a more prosperous and stable future for Ireland in the twenty-first century.

0,FT934-5857 ,"FT934-5857 _AN-DK1ACADCFT 931127   FT  27 NOV 93 / Reynolds wants summit plan for an end to Ulster violence      By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor   Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, yesterday set the creation of a joint UK-Irish framework for a permanent end to violence in Northern Ireland as the priority of his forthcoming summit with Mr John Major. His emphasis on securing an end to terrorism came as Mr James Molyneaux, the Ulster Unionist party leader, said it was possible that there could be 'significant developments over the weekend with regard to the terrorist situation'. He offered little explanation, but told his party executive in Belfast that more detailed information would be available early next week. As Mr Reynolds stepped up his campaign to reassure unionists in Northern Ireland of their veto over constitutional change, an opinion poll showed a majority of people in the Irish republic would support dropping their country's constitutional claim on the province. The poll, reported in the Irish Times, found that 51 per cent of those surveyed would agree to replace the claim with an aspiration, with 28 per cent against. Meanwhile, the UK government continued to hesitate over the timing of the summit, although Irish officials appeared confident that it would go ahead on Friday. There were also signs of important differences in the approach of the two governments to the summit. Mr Reynolds, who sent draft proposals to Mr Major on a possible framework for peace, wants the summit to concentrate on providing the background against which the IRA might declare an end to violence. That would involve a post-summit statement by the two leaders combining pledges to unionists on the constitutional integrity of the province with recognition of the legitimacy of the nationalist aspirations of the Catholic minority. It would also imply a further offer to Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, of an eventual place at the negotiating table in return for an end to violence. But Mr Reynolds' focus on the short-term possibilities for a halt to the IRA's military campaign conflicts with the much greater emphasis being placed by Mr Major on the need for a comprehensive political settlement. The UK prime minister has indicated that he is taking seriously the possibility that Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein leader, might be serious about ending the violence. However, amid growing alarm among moderate unionists about the direction of negotiations with Dublin, Mr Major wants the summit to provide the springboard for all-party talks on a political settlement. Mr Reynolds believes that should take second place to the peace process. Peace deadline, Page 7   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.     IEZ  Ireland, EC.

0,FT934-1941 ,"FT934-1941 _AN-DLPC5ADLFT 931216   FT  16 DEC 93 / Light in vale of tears: Philip Stephens asks whether the Ulster accord will end violence      By PHILIP STEPHENS   History is against them. But Mr John Major and Mr Albert Reynolds are attempting to jettison the past. It is a brave endeavour. It could end in more tears. But they might, just might, succeed. After 25 years of bloodshed, the provisional IRA has been offered the best chance it may get to extricate itself from its campaign of violence. Some among its leaders will be tempted to take it. The joint declaration by the UK and Irish prime ministers, announced in the wood-panelled splendour of the state dining room in Number 10 Downing Street, does not square the circle between the fears of Northern Ireland's unionists and the aspirations of its nationalists. But then language, no matter how carefully crafted, cannot disguise the realities which divided Ireland and then divided the community in the north of that island. Nobody looking at the history of Ulster since 1968 - stained by the killing of about 3,000 people and littered with failed political initiatives - could say confidently that Mr Major and Mr Reynolds have found the philosopher's stone. Nor could anybody listening to the thundering venom of Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the hardline Democratic Unionist party, underestimate the hatred and mistrust which seeps through the political pores of the province. When men speak easily of blood and God in the same breath, the normal rules of political judgment must be suspended. There are already mutterings of a backlash by the Protestant paramilitaries against Mr Major's 'treachery'. Then there is the IRA, an organisation which seems to have all but lost its raison d'etre during the past 25 years in an ever more brutal and random killing spree. Behind the synthetic charm of Mr Gerry Adams, the leader of the IRA's political wing, Sinn Fein, are terrorists who will find it hard if not impossible to kick the habit of murder. So it is not difficult for cynics to place the Downing Street accord among all those other failed attempts to find a political solution to a tribal war. Even some of his cabinet colleagues are not quite sure whether the prime minister has been naive in falling for what one described this week as the 'peace bandwagon'. But Mr Major and Mr Reynolds believe that this time the public mood is running in their favour. Even if the IRA cannot be coaxed quickly to the negotiating table, there is an opportunity to break the acquiescence of the law-abiding nationalist community upon which the gunmen depend. Sinn Fein kept its counsel yesterday. But producing a document which won the acquiescence of Mr James Molyneaux, the moderate Ulster Unionist leader, and applause from Mr John Hume, leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party, which is mainly Catholic, was of itself no mean achievement. The declaration is a tortuous document, showing all the awkward joins inevitable in any paper subject to literally hundreds of hours of word-by-word bargaining. Its central message, however, is relatively straightforward. Both the London and Dublin governments offer a guarantee that the unionists in Northern Ireland will never be coerced into unification with the republic. As part of an overall political settlement Mr Reynolds is ready to renounce his government's constitutional claim to the north. London, for its part, acknowledges it is neutral about the aspirations of the Irish nationalists. It has no selfish, strategic or economic interest in remaining in Northern Ireland. It will not stand in the way of unification if a majority in the province so decides. But the document is more than simply a synthesis of past public statements or a rewriting of the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement. In his recognition of the unionist veto, Mr Reynolds has become the first Irish prime minister to accept publicly the reality of partition. In return for the entrenchment of the constitutional guarantee for Ulster, Mr Major has gone further than any British prime minister before him in speaking the language of the Irish nationalists. To take one sentence from the most hard-fought section of the statement: 'The British government agree that it is for the people of the island of Ireland alone, by agreement between the two parts respectively, to exercise their right of self-determination on the basis of consent, freely and concurrently given, north and south, to bring about a united Ireland, if that is their wish.' The wording is deliberately labyrinthine. The demonology demanded it be so. But the message is clear. In return for Mr Reynolds's implicit acceptance of Irish partition, Mr Major has reinforced the studied neutrality of the British government over the ultimate future of Northern Ireland. The government will not join the ranks of the nationalist 'persuaders', but nor will it stand against such persuasion. The door has been opened to those in the Republican movement who want to exchange the bullet for the ballot box. Sinn Fein could have a probationary place at the negotiating table within three months of an end to violence. British intelligence reports suggest there is a power struggle within the IRA army council between those who want to end the terror campaign and those who are determined to fight on. Neither Mr Major nor Mr Reynolds is sure which side will come out on top. Mr Molyneaux may find it hard to offer grudging support for the initiative if Mr Paisley succeeds in his aim of mobilising hard-line unionist opinion against the declaration. The Protestant gunmen lurk in the background. The planned talks designed to shape a political settlement will be a hazardous and protracted affair. There is no guarantee that the statements of principle agreed by the two governments can be turned into new political structures for Northern Ireland. But Mr Major and Mr Reynolds joined yesterday in insisting that there was no moral alternative to the course upon which they had embarked. Now it is up to the IRA.

Publishing a report on the commission's findings in Dublin yesterday, Mr Pat Doherty, Sinn Fein vice-president, said: 'We will have to take on board the views of people who spoke to us. It has certainly informed our attitude, and we would not have involved ourselves in dialogue with so many people if we were to ignore it. It would have an influence on our thinking . . . as to how we should proceed in the weeks and months ahead.' He said Sinn Fein would make a detailed response to the Downing Street declaration before the end of next month, probably before the proposed Anglo-Irish summit - pencilled in for the latter part of the month. A document had already been drafted by the party's national executive, he said, which must be discussed with party members first. 'But this will not unduly delay our response,' he said. The report published yesterday is a summary of the 280 submissions made to the commission from across Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic during the five hearings. It does not make any specific recommendations, but it does highlight two points which are likely to be central to Sinn Fein's response to the Downing Street declaration, namely the so-called 'unionist veto' and the issue of demilitarisation. The report notes: 'A huge range of submissions felt . . . that the declaration had fudged the issue of self-determination' and says that 'the need to remove the veto' should be subject to 'further debate and discussion'. Mr Doherty insisted that majority consent in Northern Ireland to constitutional change, as embodied in the Downing Street declaration, was distinct from the unionist veto. He added: 'The Irish nation is bigger than the unionist population . . . consent means (unionist) involvement and maybe even more than that, but there cannot be a veto.' He said Sinn Fein was also looking for a means to achieve 'a total demilitarisation of the conflict' rather than focusing on just one aspect of it, namely the IRA. Sinn Fein thus appears to be moving towards proposing an extended IRA ceasefire, as opposed to the total cessation of violence as demanded by the two governments. This would be in the hope firstly of shifting the political pressure on to the loyalist paramilitaries.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P8651 Political Organizations.

It said clearly that a continuation of the IRA military campaign was an obstacle to progress in the peace process. The refusal by Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, to rush into a response to December's Downing Street declaration may smack of pedantry, procrastination and downright deviousness. But if the message that was repeatedly stated at the latest hearing of its 'Peace Commission' has found its target, then the wait will have been worth it. The Sinn Fein Peace Commission consists of a series of public hearings in Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic, in which written and oral submissions on the peace process and the Downing Street declaration are being invited from the public. The first was held in Londonderry two weeks ago. The second was held this weekend in a Dublin hotel and two more are scheduled to be held in the republic before Sinn Fein's annual congress at the end of this month. Somewhat surprisingly, the submissions made in Dublin were neither acrimonious diatribes from opponents, nor eulogies of regurgitated republicanism from sympathisers. For the most part they were carefully argued presentations, coming from people as diverse as Jesuit priests, trade unionists, community associations, civil rights activists, peace groups hostile to Sinn Fein, writers and even musicians. One of the most cogent presentations came from Mr Michael Farrell, a solicitor and civil-rights activist who is widely respected in republican and nationalist circles. He started by arguing that the joint declaration and the British government had failed to address nationalist fears adequately. But he went on to say that Sinn Fein had been 'unconvincing' in trying to draw a distinction between the joint declaration's guarantee to respect the majority wishes in Northern Ireland - described by Sinn Fein as the unionist 'veto' - and the Hume-Adams statements which the IRA supports, which speak of the need for unionist consent to any new political settlement. Moreover, continuation of the IRA campaign while clarification of the Downing Street declaration was being sought 'is irresponsible and inconsistent with (the IRA's) own support for the Hume-Adams proposals' he said. 'Whatever the situation in the past, the means are now in place to allow republicans to secure their objectives by political action. I do not believe the IRA's armed struggle could achieve anything more. Indeed I think it is counter-productive,' he said. Most of the 25 submissions carried a similar message. The British government should be pressed to offer guarantees to protect the civil rights and Irish identity of the nationalist minority in Northern Ireland, to balance the 'fulsome guarantees offered to the unionists'. But in spite of this weakness from a nationalist point of view, the Downing Street declaration had opened up new opportunities. Most importantly, a ceasefire should be declared. Mr Michael Nugent of the New Consensus movement, a long-time opponent of the IRA and Sinn Fein, called for the party to 'test the bona fides' of the joint declaration and for the IRA to declare 'a temporary and indefinite ceasefire'. This, he said, 'would open up an entirely new situation'. The Sinn Fein convener of the commission said: 'We are taking the submissions very seriously indeed.'

As Mr Major - who is to visit Washington this month - moved, officials were desperately trying to limit the damage to British interests caused by the almost unchallenged access to the US media which the Sinn Fein president enjoyed for 48 hours. But the government was unable to conceal its dismay at President Bill Clinton's decision to issue a visa for Mr Adams. Publicly, Downing Street put on a brave face. A senior official said the Anglo-US relationship was 'alive and well and extremely vigorous'. In private ministers and senior officials were bitterly disappointed at President Clinton's decision to overrule his most senior advisers. One senior minister said the president appeared to have put UK/US relations and the future of the Northern Ireland peace initiative at risk to placate the US's vocal Irish-American lobby. The government was also upset by the largely sympathetic coverage given to Mr Adams by the US media, and by the lack of balancing comments from Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary. A Downing Street official said: 'Douglas Hurd worked his arse off to get himself on American television screens. He has been pushed off the networks by programmers who have decided that Gerry Adams is more interesting.' The mood in Downing Street is unlikely to be improved by a broad hint from Mr Raymond Seitz, the US ambassador to London, that he advised Mr Clinton not to allow Mr Adams into the US. Officials disclosed that Mr Seitz was called to Downing Street for talks on Tuesday as part of a diplomatic drive to persuade Mr Clinton to distance himself from Sinn Fein. 'There was a big tussle in my government about this,' Mr Seitz added. He hoped Mr Adams' experience in the US would 'act as an encouragement for him to renounce violence and condemn it when it occurs. We will have to wait and see'. The British position was also put to Mr Al Gore, the US vice-president, by Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, and by Sir Robin Renwick, British ambassador to Washington. Downing Street said the flurry of diplomatic activity bore fruit in Mr Clinton's statement on Tuesday which supported the Anglo/Irish joint declaration on Northern Ireland and abandoned the idea of a US 'peace envoy' to Belfast.

The move, announced after yesterday's meeting of the convention's executive committee, follows the general election in which the Tories increased their total of Scottish seats to 11 while receiving 25 per cent of the vote north of the border. It comes less than a week after the Labour party in Scotland challenged Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, to hold such a referendum. Leaders of the convention, which includes Labour and the Liberal Democrats, will make fresh overtures to the Conservatives and the Scottish National party, both of which have boycotted the convention since it was founded in 1989. Canon Kenyon Wright, executive committee chairman, said the convention's model for a devolved parliament within the UK with limited tax-raising powers has been 'put on one side for a while'. Canon Wright suggested Mr Major's appointments to the Scottish Office indicated he was trying to be accommodating. What would most endanger the union would be an attitude that present constitutional rules were unbreakable, he said. Earlier, Sir David Steel, the former leader of the Liberal party, urged the government to consult other parties about holding a referendum, saying Mr Lang had not ruled this out. Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, prepared the ground for restarting 'round-table' talks on the province's future yesterday with leaders of the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party and the cross-community Alliance party. He will meet Irish ministers in the next two weeks, after which a gap in Anglo-Irish conferences is expected to be announced - paving the way for the resumption of the talks which were suspended before the UK general election. The Earl of Arran, formerly junior armed forces minister at the Ministry of Defence, is to become a junior minister at the Northern Ireland Office, it was announced yesterday. He is replaced at the ministry by former Tory MP Viscount Cranborne, who becomes a life peer. His appointment completes the prime minister's post-election ministerial shuffle. Mr Malcolm Bruce, the Scottish Liberal Democrat leader, is to stand down from the post. Nominations for the election of his successor close on May 15.  The Financial Times   London Page 4  "

Tempers became so frayed that at one point Mr Major banged the  declaration down on the table in front of him. But officials  fiercely denied Dr Paisley's claim that Mr Major was ""throwing  papers around.""    It was the kind of rowdy setback to the Downing Street  declaration that everyone expected. In fact, some observers  were astonished that the meeting ran its full 30 minute course.  They assumed Dr Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionists,  would have stormed out within the first few minutes.    And there was plainly no prospect that the Prime Minister  could influence Dr Paisley's implacable stand against the  declaration and the peace process, which he had already  denounced as ""a sham and a deceit.""    The meeting was destined to be a shouting match from the  moment Dr Paisley, and his colleagues, Peter Robinson and  William McCrea, strode into the Prime Minister's study. It was  the first ""formal"" meeting between Mr Major and Dr Paisley since  the declaration was proclaimed on December 15.    The versions of the stormy encounter from Downing Street and  from Dr Paisley did not tally in all respects -- but what was  clear from both accounts was that this was the biggest row  Downing Street has seen for years. Their reports left the  impression that Dr Paisley was roaring like a bull -- and that  the Prime Minister's own voice was more than once untypically  raised in anger. Although this was not the sort of  confrontation the Prime Minister relishes, there is a widespread  feeling that he was well-prepared for an onslaught. It will  make not the slightest difference to his faith in the  Declaration.    In other developments today:     -  Northern Ireland Secretary,  Sir Patrick Mayhew, repeated there could be no negotiations in  return for a temporary IRA ceasefire;    -  Foreign Secretary Douglas  Hurd, speaking in Dublin, underlined that all-party talks on the  Province's future still offered the best path to peace, despite  the Unionist threat to boycott any new discussions.    But the Downing Street row dominated. Afterwards, Dr Paisley  said that Mr Major was ""very, very angry.""    ""It was a very rough meeting. I have never seen the Prime  Minister more angry. I had to raise my voice in order that the  Prime Minister could hear because he was shouting so loudly,"" he  said.    Dr Paisley said he urged Mr Major to abandon the declaration  and made clear he would make it the main issue at the  Euro-elections in June. The Prime Minister, he said, was  ""throwing papers around -- he must have thrown them around three  or four times or more.""    ""We served notice on him that we were seeking a mandate from  the people of Northern Ireland against the joint declaration in  June,"" said Dr Paisley. ""He said he wanted to have peace. We  told him that you don't have peace with surrender. He was very,  very angry. He refused even to listen to the points we were  making. He abandoned the meeting and said we would have to meet  again.""    Dr Paisley described the declaration as ""a rotten, sinking  vessel which is going down now in confusion.""    Junior Northern Ireland minister Michael Ancram confirmed  that the meeting was ""very frank"" and Mr Major made his views  known ""forcibly."" He added: ""The Prime Minister took Mr Paisley  to task for misrepresenting the declaration on a number of  occasions.""    Downing Street said Dr Paisley handed over a submission, ""a  printed piece of paper about his view of things."" Officials  said he denounced the declaration as ""iniquitous"" and utterly  rejected it as a ""farce"" -- a description the Prime Minister  called ""rubbish.""    And as Dr Paisley continued to condemn the declaration, the  Prime Minister took the opportunity to point out that he had a  mandate from the people of the United Kingdom. Mr Major said  they wanted all the constitutional parties to take part in the  talks.    Dr Paisley and Mr Robinson continued expressing their  hostility to the declaration ""in rather loud terms.""    The Prime Minister said he had been very patient with Dr  Paisley but had had enough of listening to his misrepresentation  of the declaration. ""Dr Paisley continued to misrepresent the  declaration and Mr Robinson then accused the Prime Minister of  giving way to violence. The Prime Minister retorted by saying  how could he justify that statement when the Government  maintained nearly 20,000 troops in Northern Ireland.""    Mr Major was said to have been ""very calm, very firm,  extremely tough and vigorous."" But officials afterwards claimed  it was probably salutary that Dr Paisley had been given a  ""correct interpretation"" of the declaration.    Mr Hurd, said after hour-long talks in Dublin with Irish  Foreign Minister Dick Spring that fresh talks were ""the only way  in which progress was going to be likely."" He said: ""We all  know this is a difficult path and that it will not be easy.  That has been proved over and over again. But the status  quo...is not acceptable either. We all have a duty to find ways  of making progress. And we -- the two governments -- believe  the talks offer the best way. So we intend to pursue that path.""    Mr Hurd said the peace declaration was not a ""bargaining  offer.""    And Sir Patrick repeated that there could be no negotiations  in return for a temporary IRA ceasefire. A temporary ceasefire  carried the risk that the terrorists would start their campaign  again, he said in Newcastle, Co [County] Down.     "
0,FT932-2825 ,"FT932-2825 _AN-DFQCFACCFT 930617   FT  17 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Scots water privatisation plan rejected      By DAVID OWEN   THE OUTRIGHT privatisation of the Scottish water industry has been rejected by the government, at least until after the next general election. But ministers remain keen for private capital to be injected into the sector by franchising, competitive tendering for services and possibly allowing management to buy a stake in the industry. With a white paper on the future of Scottish water expected within a month, ministers are grappling with how to ensure - in the absence of an outright sale - that as little as possible of the extensive capital spending the industry requires in the next decade will come from public funds and hence count towards the public sector borrowing requirement. An estimated Pounds 5bn in capital spending is needed in the next 15 years, half to improve water quality and half for the maintenance and replacement of infrastructure. One favoured option is for a handful of publicly owned water authorities to be set up under the administration of a soon-to-be-created network of 25 to 35 unitary authorities. Under this model, private contractors could be encouraged to get involved in financing big capital projects through the offer of long-term franchises to provide services such as sewage treatment and water purification to the authorities. With about Pounds 240m a year already earmarked by the Scottish Office for capital spending over the next three years, ministers would have scope to offer public money for such projects, possibly on a joint-venture basis. The Treasury would be anxious for private investors in such cases to take responsibility for commercial risks such as cost overruns, enabling public liabilities to be fixed. This blueprint would have the further advantage of restructuring the industry in such a way that would allow it to build up a financial track record, easing the path to a possible sale after the next general election. Scottish water is currently owned and administered by regional councils, with the result that 100 per cent of the industry's liabilities must come out of the public purse. A bill covering the reorganisation of both the local authorities and the water industry is expected to be introduced in the next parliamentary session beginning in November. Ministers are also keen to drum up private-sector interest in proposals to build a Pounds 1.5bn pipeline to enable Scottish water to be exported to England. While they believe there is a widespread acceptance among consumers that water prices in Scotland will have to rise, ministers see the opportunity of selling water profitably to English water companies as a way of containing these increases. Two months ago it emerged that Scottish Enterprise, the development body in Scotland, is considering studying the feasibility of building a pipeline to carry water from southern Scotland and northern England to the south of England. The government's original decision to consider outright privatisation among a range of options for Scottish water has ignited a political storm in Scotland. Opinion polls have indicated that a large majority of Scots are against it. In April, the government angered Scottish MPs by shelving the privatisation of Northern Ireland water until after the election for 'technical reasons'. Labour and the Scottish National party seized on that decision to demand that the possible privatisation of Scottish water should also be postponed.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

0," LA090689-0007   103633    September 6, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition      Metro; Part 2; Page 6; Column 1; Editorial Writers Desk      479 words      INTERVENING IN ULSTER      There is something about Ireland that makes politicians, particularly  Americans, take leave of their senses. Usually the results of these flights of  fancy are harmless or merely vulgar. Occasionally they are mischievous and,  potentially, dangerous.    Such is the case with the California Legislature's ill-considered passage of a  bill that would compel the state's public employee and teachers' pension funds  to ensure that the companies in which they invest conform to the so-called  MacBride Principles when doing business in Northern Ireland. All that stands  between this irresponsible and pointless gesture and the statute books is the  veto we believe Gov. George Deukmejian should exercise.    The measure at issue, AB 2443, was introduced by Democratic Assemblyman John  Burton of San Francisco. If signed, it would force the two retirement funds to  report yearly on what the companies in which they invest had done ""toward the  achievement"" of the nine points in the MacBride program.    That program takes its name from one of its authors, the late Irish statesman  and jurist, Sean MacBride, a Nobel Laureate, co-founder of Amnesty  International and one-time chief of staff of the Irish Republican Army. Some of  its principles are inarguably anti-discriminatory, others -- including those  that seem to demand quotas -- are illegal under British law, while at least one  -- a requirement that employers be responsible for their workers' security as  they travel to and from their jobs -- is patently silly.    For those reasons, none of the 25 U.S. firms operating in North Ireland has  agreed to sign the MacBride Principles, which are opposed not only by the  governments of Great Britain and the United States, but also by the Social  Democratic and Labor Party to which the majority of Ulster's Catholics belong.  Unlike the promoters of the Burton bill, they understand that the American  companies, which provide 11% of all Ulster's manufacturing jobs, are regarded  as the province's leaders in ensuring equal opportunity.

Editorial    "," LA090689-0007   103633    September 6, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition      Metro; Part 2; Page 6; Column 1; Editorial Writers Desk      479 words      INTERVENING IN ULSTER      There is something about Ireland that makes politicians, particularly  Americans, take leave of their senses. Usually the results of these flights of  fancy are harmless or merely vulgar. Occasionally they are mischievous and,  potentially, dangerous.    Such is the case with the California Legislature's ill-considered passage of a  bill that would compel the state's public employee and teachers' pension funds  to ensure that the companies in which they invest conform to the so-called  MacBride Principles when doing business in Northern Ireland. All that stands  between this irresponsible and pointless gesture and the statute books is the  veto we believe Gov. George Deukmejian should exercise.    The measure at issue, AB 2443, was introduced by Democratic Assemblyman John  Burton of San Francisco. If signed, it would force the two retirement funds to  report yearly on what the companies in which they invest had done ""toward the  achievement"" of the nine points in the MacBride program.    That program takes its name from one of its authors, the late Irish statesman  and jurist, Sean MacBride, a Nobel Laureate, co-founder of Amnesty  International and one-time chief of staff of the Irish Republican Army. Some of  its principles are inarguably anti-discriminatory, others -- including those  that seem to demand quotas -- are illegal under British law, while at least one  -- a requirement that employers be responsible for their workers' security as  they travel to and from their jobs -- is patently silly.    For those reasons, none of the 25 U.S. firms operating in North Ireland has  agreed to sign the MacBride Principles, which are opposed not only by the  governments of Great Britain and the United States, but also by the Social  Democratic and Labor Party to which the majority of Ulster's Catholics belong.  Unlike the promoters of the Burton bill, they understand that the American  companies, which provide 11% of all Ulster's manufacturing jobs, are regarded  as the province's leaders in ensuring equal opportunity.    They also know that the burden of living up to the unworkable MacBride  guidelines could deter the job-creating foreign investment desperately needed  in Northern Ireland, where unemployment is more than 15%, and Catholic men are  more than twice as likely as Protestants to be jobless.

The dramatic announcement that 25 years of violence, which has engulfed the UK and several European countries, is to end with 'a complete cessation of military operations' was warmly welcomed in Dublin and Washington, and more hesitantly in London. At the same time the IRA's failure to comply with British and Irish demands to declare openly a permanent end to its armed campaign triggered an immediate note of caution from Mr John Major, the British prime minister. Mr Major, whose standing will be enhanced by an enduring peace, made clear the government would not contemplate allowing Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, into talks on Ulster's future until three months after it had become clear that violence had been renounced for good. 'I don't mind how it is expressed. . . but I do need to know that violence has ended for good and that it isn't a temporary ceasefire,' Mr Major said. Dublin, however, did not share Downing Street's caution. Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish premier, said he accepted the bona fides of the IRA. 'As far as I am concerned the war is over,' he said. 'There is now an historic opportunity to take the gun out of Irish politics for ever and to achieve a new and far-reaching political accommodation in a transformed atmosphere.' Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, brushed aside Downing's Street's reservations and called on Mr Major and unionist leaders to 'seize the moment'. The IRA leadership had 'courageously created an unprecedented opportunity which brings Anglo-Irish relations to a decisive point'. Mr Adams indicated it was up to the British government to make the next move. And he urged Britain to start the 'demilitarisation of the situation' by releasing Irish nationalist prisoners and withdrawing troops from Ulster. Republican sources were suggesting last night that, whatever London's view, the ceasefire was intended to be permanent. It was not clear, however, how or if this would be signalled. The prime minister acknowledged that the IRA decision represented 'a great step forward' but he moved to reassure unionists that there had been 'no secret deals, no secret understandings'. He added: 'Northern Ireland is part of the United Kingdom for so long as people in Northern Ireland wish to remain part of the UK. They will do so with the support of this government and I hope future governments.' The IRA announcement comes nearly nine months after the British and Irish governments signed the Downing Street declaration, which brought together the two countries in an unprecedented attempt to establish common ground for a political settlement in Ulster. The declaration, made shortly before Christmas 1993, followed talks between Mr Adams and Mr John Hume, leader of the mainly nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party. Mr Hume said he believed the republican movement wanted an end to the conflict which has claimed more than 3,000 lives in the last 25 years. Since December, both governments have insisted that the republican movement could be fully involved in the political process but only if it renounced violence for at least three months. Mr James Molyneaux, Ulster Unionist leader, echoed London's suspicions by calling on the IRA to take the 'modest but very vital step' of confirming a permanent end to violence. In spite of the government's public hard line on the IRA's omission of the word 'permanent' from its declaration, there were strong indications at Westminster last night of an early lifting of the broadcasting ban on representatives of Sinn Fein, including Mr Adams. US president Bill Clinton, who described the IRA statement as a 'watershed announcement', also called on the IRA to ensure that its violent campaign ended permanently. The US president yesterday spoke to both Mr Major and Mr Reynolds. Mr Clinton made clear his government's intention to assemble an additional aid package to help the peace process along. Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, said the British government intended to stick to its three-month 'probation' period before talks could begin on how to admit Sinn Fein to the political process. 'This is so important a matter that it ought not to be left at large or able to be the subject of discussion and argument,' Sir Patrick added. He said it was crucial that any future talks involving the IRA's political wing did not take place under the implied threat that violence could resume. Ministers will be hoping to avoid the threatened backlash by loyalist extremists. There were no signs last night that the loyalists intended to stop their campaign. Shots were fired in three separate incidents in Belfast and County Fermanagh shortly before the start of the ceasefire last night. There were no reports of injuries. Meanwhile, Ulster police were hunting a loyalist gang who murdered a 37-year-old Catholic after abducting him from a house in Antrim just hours before the IRA's ceasefire declaration. The outlawed Ulster Volunteer Force has claimed responsibility for the killing. The IRA ceasefire, Pages 10-11 Editorial Comment, Page 23   Countries:-  IEZ  Ireland, EC.

Nevertheless, intense talks between Mr John Major and Mr Albert Reynolds at the Dublin summit still left the two governments without a detailed formula to bridge the gap between the aspirations of Irish nationalists and Britain's guarantee to Ulster Unionists of a veto over a united Ireland. After what both leaders admitted had been a 'frank' exchange over Britain's contacts this year with Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, they acknowledged that it might eventually prove impossible to bridge differences over the future of the province. 'We cannot be certain we will resolve those difficulties,' Mr Major said. He and Mr Reynolds discussed different texts in detail, and said they remained committed to further talks. That raised hopes that a joint statement could be agreed when they meet in Brussels next week or during a session in London pencilled in before Christmas. Balancing the two leaders' caution, Mr Reynolds said: 'We got through quite a lot of very serious work, very productive work.' The Irish prime minister insisted during the talks that agreement on the joint declaration was essential to secure an end to violence by the IRA and set the stage for detailed talks with the political parties in Northern Ireland. He said afterwards: 'At the end of the day, peace is paramount.' It is understood that the draft of the declaration includes a renewed offer to Sinn Fein of a place in negotiations in return for an end to terrorism. Mr Major also refused to dismiss the possibility of further bilateral contacts with Republican leaders. But he insisted that the IRA could not dictate the terms of any agreement. 'There is no question of bargaining for an end to violence,' he said. Earlier Mr Major had faced sharp criticism from Mr Reynolds over the London government's covert contacts with Sinn Fein for much of this year. The Irish leader said their sharp exchanges on the issue had 'cleared the air' and paved the way for further negotiations. At the heart of the day-long talks was an attempt, so far unsuccessful, to find language that would recognise both the right of the Irish people to determine their own future and the insistence of the Ulster Unionists that nothing should be done to undercut Northern Ireland's place in the United Kingdom. Mr Reynolds repeated his pledge that the Republic accepted that the consent of the Unionist majority was essential to any change in the constitutional status of the province. He confirmed that he wanted referendums in both the north and south of Ireland to endorse any agreement reached by the two governments. Mr Major will now seek to reassure Unionist leaders that he has not agreed anything to undermine Ulster's place in the UK. Mr Reynolds appeared determined to maintain the pressure on Mr Major to agree language that would give the IRA an excuse to call a permanent end to violence. The Irish leader believes that such a cessation could transform the atmosphere in both north and south and pave the way for a durable political settlement.

0,FT944-3553 ,"FT944-3553 _AN-ELNDJACCFT 941213   FT  13 DEC 94 / Some careful planning in Belfast: John Murray Brown on the work behind the event opening tonight      By JOHN MURRAY BROWN   Like generals plotting a battle, the 'operations room' staff of Northern Ireland's Industrial Development Board were yesterday making final arrangements for Belfast's International Investment Conference, which Mr John Major, the prime minister, is due to open tonight. Surrounded by clocks showing the time in seven of the world's capitals they put final touches to the seating plan for tonight's opening dinner, which will be attended by Mr Ron Brown, US commerce secretary. Mr Maynard Mawhinney, director in charge of promotions at the IDB, said: 'It's not just an exercise in putting bums on seats. It's about sensitivities. Imagine you put two competitors on the same table. And if you do, is that a problem?' The conference is described as the biggest and most extravagant corporate event in Northern Ireland's recent history. About 250 delegates are expected, including executives from 70 businesses from the rest of Europe, the US and the far east. Given that the conference was only announced in October, the IDB is pleased with the turnout. Mr Mawhinney said: 'Germany would normally be our target market in Europe. But December is an impossible month. German companies are all holding their AGMs.' The venue for the conference is the Europa hotel. Mr Billy Hastings, head of the eponymous Ulster company which acquired the Europa from Stoy Hayward, the administrators, 15 months ago, said: 'If Northern Ireland can turn itself around as quickly as we did, things will really be happening.' The hotel, which used to be sealed off like a fortress, was bombed more than 40 times in the 25 years of violence. On the last occasion Mr Hastings was still in negotiations with the administrators. After a Pounds 6.5m refurbishment it is a potent reminder of the change that peace can bring to the city. 'We were doing a function here the last time a bomb went off,' said Ms Claire Faulkner, whose company Project Planning has been contracted to devise the conference. 'We then didn't know whether it was just a matter of sweeping up glass, or something more serious.' The real challenge on this occasion has been to get the conference ready on time. For an event of this size, the IDB would normally have sought commercial sponsorship. On this occasion there was just not time. At the weekend, replies were still coming in from businesses around the world. 'We have one person whose sole task is to cope with the late replies,' said Ms Faulkner. Delegates coming from Heathrow will travel on a British Airways Concorde which will have to fly out over the Atlantic to reach supersonic speeds - its flight time will be longer than the regular shuttle. A team of 'meeters and greeters' will be at Belfast's Aldergrove airport, with a tailor from Parson  Parsons, dress hire specialists, to measure up any male delegate who arrives without the required black tie evening dress for the dinner. The mood is celebration mixed with remembrance. A boy soprano from the city's St George's Choir will sing grace before dinner - a song entitled 'A Grateful Heart'. 'I don't know whether that will help the dinner go down or not,' said Mr Mawhinney. But no one is going to argue with the sentiment. The menu will feature Northern Ireland produce. The 370 guests will be able to drink Antrim Hills water with their North Down lamb, the renowned 'Comber' potatoes, Irish salmon and a 'Causeway' souffle. The wines are French - a Macon Blanc Villages and Chateau Canada - but liqueurs include St Brendan's cream liqueur and a Hennessey cognac, which some would describe as another Irish brand name. Before dinner, Black Velvet is on offer - a mixture of Moet  Chandon champagne and Guinness, another household name, although a southern one. Even in deciding the decor for the conference hall, politics is never far away. 'In Northern Ireland, you have to remember colours are very important. You don't want red, white and blue and equally you don't want just green, white and orange,' said Ms Faulkner referring to the union jack and the Irish tricolour, the flags of the two traditions of the province. So what is the conference's chosen colour scheme? 'A mix of terracotta and purple.'   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P9611 Administration of General Economic Programs.

Its stance underlined the differing emphases of the two governments over the next step to be taken in the Ulster peace process. Dublin is not planning an immediate response to the British government's latest proposals to renew round-table talks in Northern Ireland, but will make its own suggestions 'for additional areas of discussion' in the coming weeks. Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, described Sir Patrick's proposals as 'a checklist of relevant points in relation to the recommencement of talks', and emphasised that any new talks must be on the basis of the joint declaration and the three-strand talks that broke up without agreement in November 1992. Unease with the latest British proposals, which outline the creation of a new assembly in Northern Ireland, was underlined by a Dublin spokesman who said the Irish government 'will be making suggestions for additional areas of discussion'. Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, said that next week's UK-Irish summit in London will review progress on the joint declaration. The British and Irish prime ministers are due to meet on February 19 to attend the England-Ireland rugby match at Twickenham, and it is expected that Sir Patrick and Mr Spring will also be involved in the discussions. Ulster unionists last night reacted angrily to the news that Sir Patrick had already provided Dublin with the ideas he wants pursued.

Armistead Maupin's Tales of the City (Tuesdays, C4) has earned golden opinions as a faithful adaptation of a book with the status in Britain of being a minor classic of 20th-century American fiction. Interestingly, Maupin is not nearly such a phenomenon in the US where he is seen principally as a gay writer for a 'niche market'. Tales of the City originated in 1976 as a daily serial contributed by Maupin to the San Francisco Chronicle - not exactly a heavyweight but a family paper all the same. Running Maupin was a bold editorial decision, and some of the book's pleasure lies in imagining the impact that its light-hearted description of bath-houses, gay bars and cruising supermarkets must have had on the newspaper's more uptight readers. Inevitably, that piquancy is missing now that Tales of the City has been translated to the small screen. However, my disappointment with the TV version arises from the great virtue of the book. Maupin's chapters are only a page or so long and written with such clarity that it is impossible not to wolf one of his books down in one gulp. In Richard Kramer's respectful screenplay, the scenes are correspondingly short and the result is dialogue so sparse that it sags like an old curtain. Tales of the City started off like a somnolent alternative soap. Only into hour three has it picked up speed as the charm of Maupin's characters takes effect. Acting ranges from fair to terrific. There is a problem with DeDe Day, the spoilt little rich girl, who even by California standards hardly seemed fat enough to make sense of her crash diet to win back Beauchamp, the tomcat husband. Olympia Dukakis and Donald Moffat play a touching autumnal romance as Anna Madrigal and Edgar Halcyon, the advertising executive living on borrowed time. If you have not guessed Mrs Madrigal's secret, it is safe with me. Plain Tales from Northern Ireland (Thursday, BBC 2) is an outstanding documentary series about the people of County Fermanagh, a beautiful region of pastures and lakes that borders the Irish Republic. It is essential viewing for anyone who has ever wondered gloomily what kind of an insane society Northern Ireland must be. Writer and director Carlo Gebler is an outsider who has chosen to live and work in Ulster. As Gebler explained in a particularly illuminating programme earlier in the series, he chose to move to Enniskillen, Fermanagh's principal town. Imagine telling them in New York that a sane person might actually choose to raise a family in the place sometimes described as the British Bosnia. One objective of the series is simply to show that life in the province is not as bad as outsiders think. 'Such an appealing place to raise a family', Gebler calls Northern Ireland. 'An unspoilt world . . . crime is low . . . children can play in the street.' Nonetheless, the knowledge is inescapable that in this redoubt of old-fashioned family values, families are destroyed and blighted by violence every new day. Gebler went to Enniskillen as a resolutely impartial outsider and yet he admits that as time has gone by, it has become harder not to be affected by the tug of ancient allegiances which lie 'like an old magnet in a drawer' beneath the attractive surface of life in the province. It would be wrong to give the impression that Plain Tales from Northern Ireland is just another of those all too familiar television ego-trips for writers. Gebler's real subject is the people of Fermanagh. Without sentiment or prurience, Plain Tales evokes the stoicism of Fermanagh people and their matter-of-fact way of dealing with shock and tragedy. In one programme we met the affable proprietor of a chain of drapery stores, preparing to move back into premises destroyed by an Easter fire-bomb. A former lieutenant-colonel of the UDR, he never knows when he may not again stare into the eyes of the gunman. Last time, it was at point-blank range as he arranged a shop-window. As is the way of the place, he knew his assassin. In 15 years, three of his staff have been widowed by the Troubles. 'It's just part of the game,' he commented. Northern Ireland conforms to what a visitor expects when there are armoured cars in the streets, flags are flying and kerbstones are painted out in sectarian colours. The puzzlement comes in the towns and villages, which outwardly lack the tribal markings. Outsiders are misled by the signs and symbols, warns Gebler, who intentionally does not point out whether it is Catholic or Protestant who is speaking. This week's programme about 'The Impartial Reporter' was the most subtle so far and could have seemed a trifle dull to anyone who had not watched the rest of the series. A Unionist newspaper, The Reporter, has been owned by four generations of the Trimble family of Enniskillen. Everyone in Fermanagh reads it, Catholic and Protestant, and it makes a profit for its proprietress. The paper prides itself on impartiality but more than that, its editor pursues a policy of stimulating debate. As Gebler points out, in a society where each side is convinced it knows what the other one thinks, even to point out that there are legitimate grounds of debate requires courage. If you have not been watching Plain Tales, there is just one part left. Anyone who has will surely agree that this series has made a significant contribution to helping outsiders see the people of Ulster more clearly and sympathetically. As everyone knows, Hitler was an incorrigible showman. This week's fascinating Timewatch: The Mother of All Battles (BBC 2, Wednesday), provided yet another example of Hitler's extraordinary propensity to turn life into theatre. A German general recalled the meeting with Hitler on July 1, 1943, four days before the start of the epic Battle of Kursk in the Ukraine. It was a conflict months in the preparation that was to claim more casualties than the entire British losses during the second world war. The generals stood in a semi-circle, waiting for their Supreme Commander to discuss the battle plan. Hitler strode in and stared each man in turn full in the eye and then, without a word, strode out. The stunned generals could only think that Hitler must have been reenacting a famous painting of Frederick II, addressing his commanders on the eve of battle.

Mr Harry Rogers, who reversed Aitch into Munton Group in 1988, has left the board and paid Pounds 681,000 for Naughty Clothing, which designs, sources and imports ladies clothes. In the year to November 30 they incurred a loss after all charges of Pounds 1.2m. Aitch said that the sales would release the substantial working capital. The group will concentrate on developing its shirt and ladies leisurewear businesses. Some Pounds 5.3m of the group's overdraft has been converted into a three-year loan and the IDB of Northern Ireland has put up Pounds 500,000 of new money. The group made an Pounds 8.87m write-off of goodwill as part of a Pounds 10.16m extraordinary charge. As a result, the company will be seeking a reduction of capital. Turnover for the year was Pounds 36.5m, of which Pounds 19.7m related to continuing activities generating a pre-tax loss of Pounds 4.08m. Total losses per share were 10.03p.

But the Ulster Unionist party leader coupled his remarks with a surprisingly upbeat assessment of the prospects for agreeing a form of devolved government for the province. Downing Street welcomed Mr Molyneaux's support for efforts to agree on government structures for Ulster and said his criticism of the Major-Reynolds initiative was 'understandable'. Its discussions with the Irish government would continue. Mr Molyneaux's strongly worded Commons statement, which cast a further pall over next month's planned Anglo-Irish summit in Dublin, came as Mr John Major signalled his determination to test the IRA's willingness to agree to end its use of violence for good. Mr Major also gave his first public acknowledgment of 'suggestions' that the IRA may be considering an end to violence. Intelligence reports seen by Mr Major, who will today meet Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionists, have supported the view that Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein leader, may be ready to call a halt to the violence. Under the gaze of Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, Mr Molyneaux said London and Dublin appeared to have made 'no progress whatever' in their talks on Dublin's territorial claim over the province. He said there was no reason to question the judgment of Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, that he would be defeated if he submitted the claim to a referendum in the republic. 'Nor should anyone assume that the approval of his electorate would be given in return for a British surrender to the demands of Mr Adams.' He went on: 'The disastrous juxtaposition of discussions on political progress with the price demanded by the IRA in return for a halt to murder means in effect that Her Majesty's government is being required to do a deal, not with Mr Reynolds, but with Mr Adams.' Dublin, he said, 'is merely the conduit'. Later, he appeared to call for London and Dublin to halt their talks, saying there was a connection between Mr Adams' plans and last week's leaked Dublin draft position paper. But Mr Molyneaux said he was confident a plan for a 'durable accountable democracy' could be accepted, just as it was 'widely agreed' during last year's failed talks involving the province's four non-violent political parties. The government's efforts to secure agreement on a devolved government for the province could supply 'the essential ingredient which will stabilise a dangerously volatile situation'.

As Mr Major -- who is to visit Washington this month --  moved, officials were desperately trying to limit the damage to  British interests caused by the almost unchallenged access to  the U.S. media which the Sinn Fein president enjoyed for 48  hours.    But the government was unable to conceal its dismay at  President Bill Clinton's decision to issue a visa for Mr Adams.    Publicly, Downing Street put on a brave face. A senior  official said the Anglo-U.S. relationship was ""alive and well  and extremely vigorous.""    In private ministers and senior officials were bitterly  disappointed at President Clinton's decision to overrule his  most senior advisers.    One senior minister said the president appeared to have put  UK-U.S. relations and the future of the Northern Ireland peace  initiative at risk to placate the U.S.'s vocal Irish-American  lobby.    The government was also upset by the largely sympathetic  coverage given to Mr Adams by the U.S. media, and by the lack of  balancing comments from Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary.  A Downing Street official said: ""Douglas Hurd worked his arse  off to get himself on American television screens. He has been  pushed off the networks by programmers who have decided that  Gerry Adams is more interesting.""    The mood in Downing Street is unlikely to be improved by a  broad hint from Mr Raymond Seitz, the U.S. ambassador to London,  that he advised Mr Clinton not to allow Mr Adams into the U.S.    Officials disclosed that Mr Seitz was called to Downing  Street for talks on Tuesday [1 February] as part of a diplomatic  drive to persuade Mr Clinton to distance himself from Sinn Fein.  ""There was a big tussle in my government about this,"" Mr Seitz  added.    He hoped Mr Adams' experience in the U.S. would ""act as an  encouragement for him to renounce violence and condemn it when  it occurs. We will have to wait and see.""    The British position was also put to Mr Al Gore, the U.S.  vice-president, by Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, and by  Sir Robin Renwick, British ambassador to Washington.    Downing Street said the flurry of diplomatic activity bore  fruit in Mr Clinton's statement on Tuesday which supported the  Anglo/Irish joint declaration on Northern Ireland and abandoned  the idea of a U.S. ""peace envoy"" to Belfast.

0,FT931-432 ,"FT931-432 _AN-DC3CGAD5FT 930330   FT  30 MAR 93 / National Grid plans Pounds 300m cable link with Ireland      By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor   THE National Grid and Ireland's Electricity Supply Board are planning to build a Pounds 300m high-voltage link under the Irish Sea. The cable - with a proposed capacity of 600 megawatts - would connect the Irish grid to the rest of Europe for the first time. It could also provide a much-needed export opportunity for the UK's coal-fired power stations in the future. If the interconnector ran full-time at full capacity from Wales to Ireland, it would consume power approximately equal to the coal produced by one mine. In real operation, it is likely to account for about half the output of one pit. National Grid and ESB have just completed an economic appraisal and engineering study of two possible routes. Surveys of the sea bed show the cable could run from Dublin to Anglesey in north Wales or from Wexford to Pembrokeshire in south Wales. The next stage will be to arrange financing. According to the provisional timetable, the project could be approved within a year; construction would then start in 1995 and electricity would flow in 1998. The two parties expect the EC to make substantial funds available, in keeping with its policy of encouraging a Europe-wide transmission network. Earlier this month the EC agreed to contribute Pounds 61m towards the cost of a smaller 250MW link between Scotland and Northern Ireland. The electricity systems of Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic have been isolated since the 1970s when the cross-border interconnector was taken out of commission after repeated attacks by the IRA. It is unlikely to be reopened unless the overall security situation improves. ESB is keen to end its isolation because Ireland's electricity consumption is still growing steadily and an international link is a much cheaper and more flexible way of meeting peak demand than building power stations. The proposed connection with Wales would expand Ireland's present generating capacity of 4,000MW by 15 per cent. The link would be able to send power in either direction, depending on the relative price and demand for electricity in the UK and Ireland. But Mr Steve Drummond, head of interconnections at National Grid said: 'We are predicting that it will be used mainly to export to Ireland. There will be an opportunity for coal to provide an extra 600MW of electricity in the late 1990s.' Whichever route is chosen for the link, National Grid faces heavy expenditure to minimise the impact on the Welsh landscape. Rather than build an obtrusive line of pylons, the company is likely to bury the cable underground from the point where it comes ashore to the substation where it joins the grid.

0,FT942-6123 ,"FT942-6123 _AN-EFAEIADZFT 940601   FT  01 JUN 94 / Leading Article: Tangled yarn in Ulster   Northern Ireland has the highest unemployment rate in Britain, an economy unhealthily dependent on public support and an image which can deter foreign investors. Any private sector manufacturing project which promises to create hundreds of jobs there should normally be welcomed. However, such a welcome can only be extended with confidence when there is clear evidence that the project stands a reasonable chance of success. It is difficult, on the basis of the public information available to date, to form such a judgement about the plan by Hualon, a Taiwanese industrial conglomerate, to build a Pounds 157m synthetic fabrics plant in Belfast. Too many unresolved questions surround the background of some of the individuals involved, the economics of the project and the manner in which it has been dealt with by both British authorities and the European Commission. These questions take on particular importance because the plant is being assisted with Pounds 61m of public money. It is surprising that the government proposes to give these funds to a company, two of whose top managers have been charged - and one of them convicted - in connection with an alleged financial fraud. Ministers have declined to say whether they knew of the charges and, if so, why they considered it proper to back the project. Inquiries have been referred to Northern Ireland's Industrial Development Board, which conducted the negotiations with Hualon. The IDB's response has also been unsatisfactory. Shrinking market Lack of clarity also surrounds the plant's proposed operations. The market it is being set up to supply is already shrinking, and will face further pressures as the EU lifts controls on imports from developing countries with far lower labour costs. The IDB says Hualon plans to compete by using highly automated capital-intensive production methods. Yet it claims the plant will employ 1,800 people. Not only is that figure regarded as high by others in the textiles industry; but the European Commission says it was able to approve state aid for the plant only because its technology is so basic that it will not threaten other EU producers. Just where the truth lies is impossible to say, since the IDB refuses to disclose any details of Hualon's business plan or of the procedures used to vet the project. Nor is there any evidence that the business plan was scrutinised by independent experts before the go-ahead was given. It is difficult to imagine any prospective private investor not taking such an elementary precaution. The IDB's apparent failure to do so hardly encourages confidence in the plant's viability. UK lobbying A different set of issues arises from the conditions in which the project was approved by Brussels. The UK government's energetic lobbying for approval - against competition objections from commission experts - is inconsistent with its repeated criticisms of other countries' industrial subsidies. Nor has the Commission's apparent readiness to yield to political entreaties enhanced its reputation for impartiality. Beyond that, the case highlights a deeper dilemma in EU policy. In principle, its efforts to encourage the transfer of resources to Europe's poorer regions are to be commended. In practice, the result has too often been rivalry between governments to woo mobile investments with large financial inducements. These penalise other producers and distort markets, particularly in sectors such as synthetic fibres where there is chronic excess capacity. Such policies also risk attracting marginal investment projects which cannot raise funds elsewhere. Above all, governments' overriding desire to create jobs can too easily impair their judgment. A memorable consequence was the De Lorean car venture in Northern Ireland, which collapsed in the early 1980s. There is no evidence to suggest the Hualon plant will suffer a similar fate. But taxpayers and the people of Belfast need more information about the project. The political accountability of the IDB also needs to be clarified. If ministers will not provide answers voluntarily, the newly-formed Commons Northern Ireland committee should require them to do so.   Companies:-  Hualon Corp.

0,FT932-4865 ,"FT932-4865 _AN-DFGB7ADZFT 930607   FT  07 JUN 93 / The Week Ahead: BAA flies in on upgraded forecasts - Results due   BAA, the airport operator, has enjoyed upgraded forecasts in recent weeks ahead of its full-year results today. Traffic growth has meant more revenues from landing fees and retail trade. Pre-tax profits could approach Pounds 300m against Pounds 192m. A Pounds 30m gain on the sale of its electrical distribution network will be offset by provisions on property. Northern Foods is expected to report on Wednesday pre-tax profits for the full year a shade above Pounds 150m, up from Pounds 126.2m a year earlier. The forecast increase reflects a strong performance by short shelf-life foods, notably the convenience meals supplied to Marks  Spencer, and continued gains from post-acquisition rationalisation of the Express milk operations. However, biscuits and other grocery products are expected to show the impact of recession, while high beef and pork prices have offset the benefits of efficiency improvements in the processed meat businesses. Unigate, the food and distribution group, is expected tomorrow to announce profits almost unchanged at Pounds 93m for the year to March 31. Analysts will be watching to see whether the company has recovered from a disappointing first half, and also at Unigate's gearing levels. Last month the company postponed an initial public offering of its US restaurant business, which had been designed to reduce net borrowings. Pilkington, the glass group which announces results on Thursday, is expected to announce a sharp fall in profits from Pounds 77m to Pounds 37m for the year to March 31. But attention is likely to focus on Pilkington's cash flow and the dividend, which the company maintained by raiding reserves at the interim stage. Analysts will also be keen to hear more about Pilkington's plan to make a joint bid to acquire Societa Italiana Vetro from the Italian authorities. Vodafone, the cellular telephone network spun off from Racal, has benefited from a sharp increase in new subscribers. Pre-tax profits for the year to March, to be announced tomorrow, are forecast at about Pounds 320m against Pounds 272m a year earlier. PowerGen, the smaller of the two main electricity generators, has seen a small erosion of its market share during the year but cost cutting will have helped it life pre-tax profits to about Pounds 415m from Pounds 359m. Christian Salvesen, the distribution group, is expected to report pre-tax profits for the year to March of around Pounds 75m.

0,FT933-6512 ,"FT933-6512 _AN-DH0CBAB2FT 930827   FT  27 AUG 93 / Patten rejects fears of university shortages      By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent   THE number of school leavers unable to find university places is likely to be much lower than feared, Mr John Patten, the education secretary, forecast yesterday. Mr Patten, who has returned to work after a six-week illness, said the outlook was 'going to be nothing like as gloomy as some people have predicted'. Commentators have suggested that thousands of students will fail to win places on arts courses because of a 30 per cent cut imposed by the government in tuition funding Mr Patten said many universities still had vacancies on arts courses, including English places at 27 universities and geography at 26 universities. He also advised students to consider attending one of the 350 colleges of further education, 131 of which offered degree courses. He defended the funding cut, which was intended to encourage students to switch from arts to science courses. Speaking on BBC radio he said: 'Can we afford to be a country which has too few people going into science? That strikes me as the major problem at the moment.' He was concerned that only 64,000 students took mathematics at A-level - the main examination for 18-year-olds in England, Wales and Northern Ireland - this year, compared to 82,000 in 1989. Only 34,000 took physics at A-level, compared to 47,000 in 1989. Mr Patten said: 'That is a pretty substantial problem. It's not purely a political problem, it is a marketing problem - trying to persuade children that science is interesting and rewarding.' He rejected suggestions that his political credibility had been damaged by a series of retreats on policy issues following protests from teachers. He said his strategy had received full support in the recent report by Sir Ron Dearing, who heads the government's review of the national curriculum. Following the report the government abandoned detailed curriculums for most subjects and withdrew plans to publish league tables of schools based on pupils' performance. Mr Patten congratulated pupils and teachers on a record number of high grades in GCSE passes - in contrast to his suggestion last year that improved results were a reflection of lower standards. Examination results released yesterday showed that more than half the 5m entrants in England, Wales and Northern Ireland achieved A, B or C grades. The percentage of these grades - the equivalent of the former O-level pass - rose by 1.1 per cent to 52.4 per cent. Mr Patten said pupils and teachers could 'take particular pride in the fact that this year's papers have been marked against the much more stringent standards laid down in the code of practice for the examining boards which I announced last January'.

He told MPs that he knew nothing of what had been agreed by the two nationalist leaders. The prime minister also delivered a scarcely veiled rebuke to Mr Albert Reynolds. He said the Irish premier's announcement that he was to have talks on the initiative with Mr Major in Brussels next week was 'uncleared with me'. If Mr Reynolds wished to raise matters that he believed would bring violence to an end in Northern Ireland, 'then I am compelled to listen', Mr Major said. He emphasised again his government's refusal to negotiate with terrorists. 'We do not negotiate with people who deal with bullet and bomb and we do not surrender to their violence either now or in the future,' he said in comments which brought cheers from the Ulster Unionist party benches. His remarks came just two days after Mr James Molyneaux, the Ulster Unionist leader, dismissed the Hume-Adams initiative as 'sheer lunacy'. Mr Major is under pressure to take account of the Ulster Unionist position because of the precariousness of his 17-strong Westminster majority. His meeting with Mr Reynolds is expected to take place two days after the next scheduled meeting of the Anglo-Irish conference in Belfast next Wednesday. Mr Major's comments came as the Institute for Public Policy Research, the left-of-centre think-tank, published a plan for a new constitution for the province in which sovereignty would be shared by its people and the British and Irish governments. Mr Kevin McNamara, Labour's Northern Ireland spokesman, said the IPPR model deserved 'considered examination' but the party had no plans to change its policy of unity only by consent.

0,FT923-1803 ,"FT923-1803 _AN-CIUDDAECFT 920921   FT  21 SEP 92 / Survey of Northern Ireland (4): The cost of containing terror - With cash scarce, efforts are focused on improving intelligence      By TIM COONE   A FAVOURITE game among journalists in Northern Ireland is to try to trap a minister into defining what is an 'acceptable level of violence', the point being that if the IRA cannot be defeated by military means as the security forces experts say, then at what level can the violence be contained until such time as the paramilitaries can be defeated by economic, social and political means? The ministers have their standard reply prepared. 'There is no acceptable level of violence,' they say. Government statistics hint in numbers at what ministers are unable to define in words. Last year there were 499 shooting incidents, 367 bomb incidents and 237 incendiary devices which exploded or were defused, all relating to paramilitary activity. Over the past four years shootings have oscillated between 500 and 600 - the bombings between 300 and 450. In 1991, 94 people died as a result of the violence, 75 of them civilians - many of those sectarian murders. Murders by Loyalist paramilitaries are now running almost as high as those by the IRA, and last month's banning of the Ulster Defence Association (UDA) is a recognition of the growing threat they also pose to political stability in the province. Criminal injuries and damage expenditure, paid by the government as compensation to the victims of the violence, is running at over Pounds 40m per year. This caused the government to temporarily suspend its capital investment programme in Northern Ireland earlier this year. So what more can be done to contain the violence? When paramilitary activity showed an upturn at the end of last year, two more army battalions were flown into the province. In addition, 400 more Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) officers have been recruited bringing RUC strength up to 8,500. Total army strength is now around 18,500 including 6,000 from the Royal Irish Regiment (formed by merging the Ulster Defence Regiment and the Royal Irish Rangers). Troop levels are now the highest since 1979. On the streets of Belfast and the country lanes of Armagh, there is a now a highly visible army presence. Random checkpoints are set up to make more difficult the movement of weapons and explosives. The incessant judder and whine of the round-the-clock helicopter patrol over Belfast, adds an Orwellian flavour to the city's already militarised atmosphere. Locals say they no longer notice it. Mr Michael Mates, the new minister responsible for security in Northern Ireland, while fighting for more resources, is concerned that any higher level of troop presence could prove counter-productive. He says turning Belfast into a 'fortress' would be to hand the IRA a propaganda victory. Other considerations are cost and manpower limitations. The planned defence cuts in the armed forces will sharply deplete the number of regular army troops available for Northern Ireland. Already several battalions there are understrength and additional companies are having to be seconded in from the mainland. Expenditure cuts are also being felt at the RUC. In his annual strategy statement made at the beginning of the year the RUC chief constable Sir Hugh Annesley said 'the uncertainty of future major capital expenditure and insufficient technical staff continue to be major problems'. With no blank cheque available to help bring down the level of violence, the security forces are therefore focusing their resources on improving their intelligence activities and in targeting the finance and munitions flows to the paramilitary organisations. The RUC's new anti-racketeering squad claims to have had considerable success in drying up numerous sources of finance of both IRA and Loyalist paramilitaries in the past year, and new legislation is in the pipeline to make it easier for the police to investigate and prosecute businesses and organisations suspected of channelling funds. The Libyans are under pressure from the United Nations to give hard intelligence to the UK government which might lead to a breakthrough in locating the remaining 100 tons or so of weapons supplied in the mid-1980s to the IRA, most of which is thought to be still hidden in the Irish Republic. However, cross-border co-operation is improving and, significantly, Mr Mates and Mr Padraig Flynn, the Irish justice minister, met privately in Belfast recently, the first such meeting outside the formal structure of the Anglo-Irish talks. A new area of concern is the sourcing of weapons from the former eastern European states which are undergoing fragmentation and civil war. 'We are very much alive to the danger, but there is no evidence yet of any new arms supplies,' a senior RUC source said. The RUC views its intelligence-gathering operations through penetration of the paramilitary organisations as a priority area of its work. Sir Hugh said pointedly, in his strategy document: 'Public co-operation and understanding in this difficult task is crucial if we are to succeed.' Equally as crucial are moves to improve liaison between the Army and the RUC. A new body called the Province Executive Committee (PEC) was established during the summer, which will co-ordinate intelligence gathering and sharing at the top level. The PEC is chaired by Mr Blair Wallace, the deputy chief constable of the RUC. In principle the RUC is in charge of all security operations in Northern Ireland, including intelligence gathering. MI5, however, has run its own operations independently in the province for two decades, some of which have come under intense criticism for alleged involvement in Loyalist paramilitary activities. Earlier this year MI5 was given overall responsibility for intelligence operations against the IRA on the mainland, replacing the Metropolitian Police Special Branch. This in effect confers and confirms a similar role for MI5 in Northern Ireland.  The Financial Times   London Page 14  "

0,FT942-4350 ,"FT942-4350 _AN-EFJCMABYFT 940610   FT  10 JUN 94 / Research funding to favour commercial use      By JOHN AUTHERS   University research which is directly relevant to commerce and industry is to receive more funding, under government plans published yesterday. The quangos which control funding for universities - the higher education funding councils for England, Scotland and Wales and the Department of Education for Northern Ireland - said they wanted to address complaints by employers that funding was skewed towards basic or academic research. They also intend to implement proposals to improve technology foresight published in last year's white paper from the Office of Science and Technology. The new rules will be applied to the university research assessment exercise which starts in 1996. The judgments it then makes on the quality of research will determine research funding from 1997 onwards. Total government research funding for that year has not yet been decided but this year's budget from the Department for Education, for English universities alone, was Pounds 618m. Mr Bahram Bekhradnia, head of policy for the Higher Education Funding Council for England, said the council hoped to appoint industrialists to the panels which will judge the university departments. They would work jointly with the leading academics who currently control funding. Requirements that departments submit only published academic research will be dropped. Now patents, and the results of industrial research undertaken for companies, will be judged on the same basis. This means a university doing only industrial research could still attract a top allocation of research funding if the research is of high quality. However, Mr Bekhradnia stressed that the aim was only to 'redress the balance', after criticism that industrial research had been ignored. The funding councils will not attempt to force universities out of more abstract basic research. The English funding council has also stopped the requirement that departments should submit lists of all articles each researcher has published. This follows claims that this had led to a 'publish or perish' attitude, with lecturers publishing work which was incomplete, or trivial. The grading system has also been made more detailed, with seven quality grades instead of five. The Scottish funding council has the power to steer extra funds to specific subjects if they are important to the local economy. It is still discussing whether to do so.

I believe that this is now the case and, although I have done nothing improper, the daily leaking of letters and so-called quotes from unknown sources - most of them wildly inaccurate - is causing such cumulative damage to the important work of government that I must do what I can to bring it to an end. I therefore wish to go. The past 14 months have been the happiest and most fulfilling of my political life. Working for Paddy Mayhew, a wise and brave secretary of state, and being part of a government facing huge challenges which we are starting to overcome, has been an unforgettable experience. Thank you for giving me the chance to serve. I shall now do what I can to put my part of the turmoil to rest. You need and deserve the staunch support of the whole party. It goes without saying that you have mine: now and for the future. In retrospect, I rather wish I had sent the watch with its now famous message to you. Yours ever, Michael John Major's reply: Dear Michael, Thank you for your letter today. As I explained when you asked to see me, I fully accept that you acted with complete propriety in raising with the attorney-general the concerns that had been put to you about Mr Nadir's case. I made it clear, as I have done in parliament, that I have no criticisms of your actions on that account. I do, however, understand the reasons why you have decided you must stand down from the government, and I respect them. I am most grateful for all the work you have done in the Northern Ireland Office since the election. You have handled the very difficult security portfolio with great fortitude and skill, as well as dealing with finance and personnel issues. It is a job that makes immense demands, which you have met fully and effectively. I know that Paddy Mayhew shares that view. I am sorry that you had to stand aside from the government in circumstances like this. But I am sure that you took the right decision with your usual sense of duty.

While firmly restating London's insistence on a permanent cessation of IRA violence, Sir Patrick aimed to encourage republicans to enter the peace process in a speech to the Foreign Policy Association in New York. He said an end to the armed conflict in Ulster was 'not going to require any surrender'. The recent three-day ceasefire was not enough, said Sir Patrick, and he made clear that any similar gestures - hinted at by Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president - would also be dismissed. He stressed that if Sinn Fein renounced its support for violence and delivered an end to armed action it would within three months join exploratory talks leading it to a full role in the democratic process. His remarks were being seen last night as recognition of the need to enable the republican movement to extract itself from violence without having to concede defeat. Downing Street insisted they did not change government policy 'one iota', however. The Downing Street declaration did not require any party to give up its aspirations or beliefs but simply to renounce violence as a means of pursuing them, it said. Sir Patrick's measured comments, in which he also acknowledged Sinn Fein's electoral mandate in the province, drew condemnation from unionists. Mr David Trimble, Ulster Unionist MP for Upper Bann, said the speech undermined the government's integrity and would create 'confusion and alarm' among Ulster's law-abiding majority. Mr James Molyneaux, the UUP leader, said the remarks were 'ill-judged'. Mr Nigel Dodds, secretary of the Democratic Unionist party, said he was alarmed that Sir Patrick should send signals to terrorists saying they need not surrender. 'It confirms our view that the government is not in the business of seeking to defeat the IRA at all,' he said. The speech was given a qualified welcome by Mr Tom Hartley, national chairman of Sinn Fein, who said it appeared to recognise 'the reality that there will be no unilateral surrenders by any side'. Mr Seamus Mallon, deputy leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party, also welcomed Sir Patrick's remarks, saying they were in accordance with the declaration. Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, said he had always maintained there was no question of a military victory or a military defeat for either side. The road to a just solution could be 'long, slow and painful,' he acknowledged. The Commons Northern Ireland committee meets today for the first time and is expected to elect Sir James Kilfedder, leader of the Ulster Popular Unionist party, as chairman.

0,FT942-8442 ,"FT942-8442 _AN-EETCSADUFT 940520   FT  20 MAY 94 / Limit to Irish waiting game      By JOE ROGALY   Sinn Fein will squeeze much propaganda out of the 20 questions it sent to the British government last Friday. The answers will be treated in the same fashion. That was the purpose of the exercise. The political front of the Irish Republican Army will derive raw material for its constant public relations offensive from the commendably robust reply prepared for it in London yesterday. As expected, Britain restated its known position. The government could not afford to show any give, nor did it. If Sinn Fein/IRA is true to form, questions and British commentary alike will be deployed as evidence of the 'reasonableness' of the armed republicans' cause and methods. Then the terrorists will carry on shooting and bombing as usual. Wait a minute. The above prognostication jars. It is not in tune. It differs from the conventional wisdom. Officials and ministers in London, Dublin and Belfast have recently begun to sing a familiar song. There is an evident longing for peace, they warble. We are at last reaching the end of the period of terrorism that began a quarter of a century ago. The Northern Ireland secretary, Sir Patrick Mayhew, exudes confidence in the peace process. The Irish prime minister, Mr Albert Reynolds, has long spoken as if an early ceasefire was probable. His foreign secretary, Mr Dick Spring, talked yesterday morning of clearing the logjam within the next few days. Even the president of Sinn Fein, Mr Gerry Adams, speaks as if we had reached the end-game. Perhaps we have, but there is no telling how long the final agony will last. The IRA could lay down its arms tomorrow, if it chose. Equally, it could continue the 'armed struggle' for the rest of this year, or another five years, or another generation. In a new book* on the province published on Monday Kevin Boyle and Tom Hadden, academics born in Ulster, suggest that the security forces 'now appear to have moved towards a strategy of containment pending the achievement of some form of political accommodation'. Equally it might be said that the IRA has set itself the limited objective of maintaining its present level of operations in the hope of securing an eventual British withdrawal. 'Seen in these terms, both sides appear to have the capacity to continue indefinitely,' say Boyle and Hadden. Much de-pends on how long it takes for the message implicit in the Irish-British declaration of December 15 1993 to sink in. Its essence is that the prime ministers of the two countries, Mr Reynolds and Mr John Major, have determined that if Sinn Fein wants to be treated as a constitutional political party it must first renounce violence. As Mr Reynolds said on Sunday, 'it also requires acceptance that, where you have two communities, political structures cannot be based on simple majoritarianism'. The IRA/Sinn Fein will doubtless search for differences between Mr Reynolds's 'clarifications' of the joint declaration and last night's British commentary on its 20 questions. It is not clear how assiduously the two governments have worked to compare notes in advance, but the assumption must be that their responses do not deviate from the principles of the December declaration. Just one of the IRA's 20 questions seemed to Sir Patrick to be on a point of genuine textual ambiguity. It was answered accordingly. The rest were grouped under various tags, such as whether they sought to reopen negotiations on the declaration, or whether they were mere repetitions of previous positions. If the optimists are right, the armed nationalists will now perceive that their only hope of achieving anything like a united Ireland lies in the peaceful persuasion of a majority of the people of Ulster. This argument is doubtless being deployed in smoke-filled rooms in the six counties, but it is anybody's guess as to when, or whether, it will prevail. No one pretends that a referendum now would produce any result other than a defeat for the concept of a united Ireland. This position may change as the Catholic proportion of the population increases. Unionists won 62 per cent of the votes in the elections to the Northern Ireland assembly in 1973. In last year's local elections their score was down to 49 per cent. The nationalist vote rose from a quarter to a third over the same period. Yet this is a slow process. The IRA/Sinn Fein is being asked to do a deal from which it cannot hope to profit for another generation. It will only acquiesce if it is convinced that there is no other way - that however much a section of the British public may long to be detached from Northern Ireland, it will not do so under duress, nor against the will of the people of the province. In London and Dublin this may seem like a statement of the obvious. There may be a long, bloody wait before it is accepted in Belfast. This does not mean that the Irish and British governments need do nothing. Once next month's elections to the European Parliament are out of the way, they should try once again to get the constitutional parties in the province to talk about a new settlement for governance of Ulster. The Boyle and Hadden book lists a variety of possibilities, some based on the ethnic separation that has evolved as Catholics and Protestants have moved to areas safer for themselves. The authors explore the power-sharing option, but their charts, particularly when set beside a Flemish-Walloon map of Belgium's provinces, speak for communal self-government. A 'preferendum' is proposed, based on the experience of Newfoundland in the 1940s. The options suggested for Ulster include continued direct rule, but not immediate unification with the south. There would be 'little point' in asking about that, say Boyle and Hadden. They propose that the Irish constitution and British law be altered, so that both promised to legislate for a united Ireland if at any time in the future a majority of the people of Ireland and Ulster voted in favour. It may seem fanciful to talk of preferendums and new internal arrangements for Ulster while the terrorist outrages continue. Unification, if it ever comes, is for well into the next century. But the two governments cannot wait forever for the IRA to make up its mind. As Mr Reynolds, quoting Edmund Burke, said at the weekend, 'there is a limit at which forbearance ceases to be virtue'. *Northern Ireland: the Choice, Penguin, Pounds 6.99   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

0,FT943-9252 ,"FT943-9252 _AN-EHLDRACAFT 940812   FT  12 AUG 94 / Efficiency measures fail to help energy trust      By DAVID LASCELLES   Measures to encourage more efficient electricity use are included in the price controls, although they will not help the government's beleaguered Energy Savings Trust. Electricity companies have an incentive to sell as much electricity as possible because their profits are directly related to volume. In future volume will account for only half the 'revenue driver' which determines a company's profits. The other half will be based on the number of customers the company has. Prof Littlechild argues that this will reduce the volume incentive while encouraging companies to go out and seek new customers. He will also allow companies to keep more of the profits made from reducing power losses, which amount to 7 per cent of the electricity passing through the system. Prof Littlechild expects these measures to produce savings equivalent to the electricity used by a city the size of Nottingham. However, he decided against introducing fresh measures to curb demand for electricity. Last year he approved an allowance in the price controls that will raise Pounds 100m in four years for electricity companies to spend on energy efficiency projects. He said yesterday that he was unwilling to increase this because the full costs and benefits of demand side measures have not yet been established in the UK. He also believed that it was not the regulator's job to impose what was essentially a tax on consumers, even if it was for a worthy cause. This marks a further blow for the government-sponsored Energy Savings Trust, which is supposed to raise several hundred million pounds from gas and electricity users for domestic energy efficiency work. Ms Clare Spottiswoode, the gas regulator, has already said that funding for the trust is a matter for parliament, not her. Mr Andrew Warren, director of the Association for the Conservation of Energy, said he was 'deeply disappointed' by the review because it 'reversed the regulator's position on the Energy savings Trust'. He also said that the reduction of the volume component of the revenue driver to 50 per cent was not enough to cut the profligacy of the electricity companies. 'It's 25 per cent in Northern Ireland and 10 per cent in the gas industry because that is what the real costs are,' he said.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Just hours after the Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick  Mayhew said he believed there could still be a positive response  by the provisionals to the Downing Street declaration, the man  who leads the political wing of the IRA said he was prepared to  go ""the extra mile.""    An end to the violence was now his personal and political  priority and he added: ""I am willing to seek to persuade the IRA  to make a definitive decision on the conduct of its campaign.""    Earlier at an Anglo-Irish Conference meeting in Dublin Sir  Patrick said there was still a chance of peace.    He said: ""We believe we may yet see a positive response from  the provisionals. There are rational grounds for hope because  it is so much the will of, and the demand of the people of this  island.""    Although Mr Adams did not renounce the use of IRA violence  --  the White House has sought that assurance before the State  Department allows him in to America to attend a major conference  in New York on Tuesday [1 February] -- the tone of his remarks  tonight were the most conciliatory since Mr Major and the  Republic's premier Mr Albert Reynolds signed the historic peace  initiative six weeks ago.    Mr Adams said: ""I want to see an end to all violence and an  end to this conflict. I do not advocate violence. It is my  personal and political priority to see an end of the IRA and an  end to other organisations involved in armed actions.    ""This means an end to the British Army presence and the  disbandment of the IRA. It means an end to Loyalist death  squads. In other words a demilitarisation of the situation.    ""I am willing to seek to persuade the IRA to make a  definitive decision on the conduct of its campaign.    ""I have said on a number of occasions my willingness to go  to  the IRA with a proposition when such a proposition is  forthcoming from the peace process.""    Pressure on Sinn Fein mounted today when the U.S. government  effectively refused party president Adams his visa.    A statement in Washington said the White House would only  consider his application if he publicly renounced violence and  threw his support behind the Downing Street declaration.    At the same time, the first of four Sinn Fein ""peace  commission"" hearings to gauge reaction to the London-Dublin  statement within the republican movement was being held in  Londonderry.    Sir Patrick -- speaking after a meeting in Dublin of the  Anglo-Irish intergovernmental Northern Ireland Conference --  also appeared to offer greater scope than before for  clarification for the republicans of the December 15 document  signed by Prime Minister John Major and his Irish counterpart  Albert Reynolds.    Sir Patrick claimed that a letter sent by Mr Adams to Mr  Major amounted to a request for negotiation rather than  clarification.    He emphasised: ""We will continue to make clear what the  document does and does not do. We continue to make speeches  that do just that.    ""I do not believe there is anything between the two  governments on this and I certainly don't wish to see anybody  under any genuine misapprehension as to what the declaration  says.    ""What I am not prepared to do is to negotiate. I am not  prepared to unravel something that has taken as long as this has  to put together, and which is very clear and comprehensive.""    The conference meeting, initially set to end early this  afternoon, went on for more than six hours.    In a joint statement afterwards, Sir Patrick and joint  chairman Dick Spring, Ireland's deputy premier and foreign  minister, condemned recent violence in Ulster and said a range  of issues had been reviewed.    Sir Patrick relayed British disappointment at the Irish  government's recent decision to scrap a 20-year-old ban on  broadcasting interviews with members of the IRA, Sinn Fein and  other groups with paramilitary links. A similar ban continues  to operate in the UK.    Mr Adams said he was now actively engaged in developing an  unarmed strategy.    The Sinn Fein president added: ""It should be encouraged, not  discouraged. Indeed, despite all the difficulties, Sinn Fein  has now moved to a position where our main function as a  political party is to build a peace process.""    He said the development of that process, which included the  Downing Street declaration, was a response to his party's peace  strategy and the initiative undertaken between him and SDLP  leader John Hume.    Sinn Fein, he said, was committed to a peace settlement.    He added: ""I am concerned, I am indeed anxious to be  persuaded that the Downing Street declaration can provide a  basis for us. And even if this is not the case, even if there  is a gap between what is required and what is on offer then we  should all move to bridge that gap. I am persuaded to go the  extra mile.""    Apart from the Downing Street declaration, Mr Adams tonight  clearly had America on his mind when he spoke.    The White House is seeking a form of words which would  enable  President Clinton to issue a waiver of a long-term visa ban  imposed by the immigration authorities because of the Sinn Fein  president's alleged involvement in violence.    Mr Adams has been invited to address a conference in New  York  on Northern Ireland next Tuesday. It is being organised by the  National Committee on American Foreign Policy.    Senators Edward Kennedy and Christopher Dodd are among those  campaigning for a lifting of the ban, but the Speaker of the  House of Representatives, Mr Tom Foley, one of the most powerful  Irish Americans in Washington, is apparently opposed to it and  there is pressure from the British as well to resist any moves  to allow the Sinn Fein president in.    The leaders of the four main constitutional parties have  been  invited but it is understood the two Unionist leaders, Mr James  Molyneaux and the Rev Ian Paisley, have declined.     "
0,FT934-2173 ,"FT934-2173 _AN-DLOCPAECFT 931215   FT  15 DEC 93 / Leading Article: Jaw-jaw in Ulster   The meeting between the British and Irish prime ministers planned for today should result in an agreed statement on the way forward to a peace deal for Ulster. It is always a mistake to be unduly optimistic about Northern Ireland, as the latest IRA 1,000lb bomb, discovered and defused in Belfast yesterday, indicates. Yet there is evidence of a strong desire for peace in both the north and south of Ireland. More to the point, the possible outlines of an eventual peace agreement that should command support from all but the most recalcitrant extremists can now be discerned. One element might be some form of devolved assembly for the governance of the province. Its exact composition and functions would have to be negotiated with the legitimate political parties of Ulster. Once the IRA has convincingly turned away from violence Sinn Fein will doubtless be invited to join those negotiations. Mechanisms for co-operation between Dublin and Belfast might be included in the eventual package. Such constitutional details are of secondary importance to the Anglo-Irish declaration of intent on which Mr John Major and Mr Albert Reynolds spent so much telephone time yesterday. In this delicate area every word is potentially lethal. Both prime ministers propose a guarantee that the constitutional status of Ulster will not be changed without the consent of its people, but agreement on everything else has been difficult. Referendum The IRA, which should not be permitted to call the tune, might, it appears, accept a northern veto on Irish unity, but only if the proposition is first approved by a referendum of all the people of the island of Ireland, north and south. That is unacceptable to many unionists. Mr Reynolds has offered to relinquish the articles in the republic's constitution that claim the territory of Northern Ireland, in return for a British statement recognising as legitimate, and promoting, the aspiration for Irish unity. Mr Major has had to consider the possibility of setting off a new outburst of violence by loyalist paramilitaries if he appears to lean too strongly in the republican direction. In marches and opinion polls the people of Ireland and Ulster have expressed their desire for the talks between the two prime ministers to succeed. Business leaders concur, as the FT's survey of senior business opinion in the province indicates. The poll, taken on Thursday and Friday of last week, reflects the views of chief executives of leading firms. Of 80 companies approached, 56 responded. This suggests an unprecedented willingness to express a business view of the politics of Northern Ireland. It is a measure of the economic damage that the troubles have done. Opportunities Perhaps it is not so surprising that 90 per cent of those who replied to the FT questionnaire said that an agreed political settlement that achieved an end to the violence would have a 'very' or 'fairly' positive effect on business and economic opportunities. The chief executives were, however, evenly split on the prospects. Most of them do not believe that terrorism can be defeated by military means. Some 70 per cent believe it impossible to defeat the IRA; the corresponding figure for the loyalist paramilitaries is 64 per cent. In the nature of things in the province business leaders are more likely to be Protestants than Catholics. It is striking that 61 per cent of them accept the notion of separate referenda in both parts of the island, albeit on the assumption that the purpose would be to affirm a deal guaranteeing a majority veto in Northern Ireland and leading to an end to the Republic's constitutional claim to the north. There is also a remarkable degree of support for negotiation with Sinn Fein  -36 per cent at once, or as soon as the IRA announces that it will abandon violence, and 59 per cent after the IRA has kept to a peaceful path for a period of time. Just over half the respondents favoured stronger devolved power structures in the province, and a third thought business would prosper if there were north-south links. This survey reflects moderate opinion. Today's statement of intent should challenge terrorists on both sides to lay down their arms.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.     IEZ  Ireland, EC.

0,FT943-4614 ,"FT943-4614 _AN-EIHDIABSFT 940908   FT  08 SEP 94 / Diplomacy reigns in the unarmed struggle: The advance of peace in Ireland      By KEVIN BROWN, TIM COONE and JIMMY BURNS   As the smoke of battle clears following the IRA's ceasefire announcement, the peace strategy being followed by the British and Irish governments is emerging through the haze. It looked as though the process had gone awry on Tuesday when London dismissed as 'premature' a historic meeting in Dublin between Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, and Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president. While Mr Reynolds eagerly accepted Mr Adams' assurance that the IRA had ended its terrorist campaign, Mr John Major continued to demand guarantees that there would be no return to violence. Meanwhile, in a theatrical confrontation in Downing Street, Mr Ian Paisley, Ulster's single most popular Unionist leader, was ejected from the cabinet room for refusing to accept that Mr John Major does not tell lies. The dramatic series of events prompted reports of renewed tensions between London and Dublin amid speculation that Mr Reynolds wishes to move much faster towards all-party talks on Northern Ireland than Mr Major thinks wise. There are clear differences of perspective between London and Dublin, not least because most of the carnage inflicted by the IRA has been within the UK's borders. The view from Dublin is also coloured by the historical fact that all the Irish political parties except Labour are descended from the old Sinn Fein party which campaigned for independence from Britain. Perhaps because of these links the Irish government is more convinced than London of the permanence of the Sinn Fein leader's change of heart, and less concerned about a possible slide back to violence. In spite of their differences the two governments are moving in tandem towards the dual objective of entrenching Sinn Fein within the democratic process while demolishing unionist suspicions of a sell-out to the IRA. The British government was obliged to deprecate the speed with which Mr Reynolds moved to meet Mr Adams because of the widespread distaste for the Sinn Fein leader among unionists and Tory rightwingers. But ministers are aware that the ceasefire declaration was opposed by a hardline faction in the IRA, and that it could collapse unless Mr Adams is able to show results from the so-called 'unarmed struggle.' For the same reason the government has reduced security in Northern Ireland, and would not be greatly unhappy to see Mr Adams make a second propaganda visit to the US, although it would formally urge President Clinton not to grant a visa. Mr Major also accepts that Mr Adams cannot deliver the guarantee of a 'permanent' end to violence that London originally demanded because that would be regarded by the hardliners in the IRA as tantamount to surrender. Ministers remain hopeful that a form of words can be agreed, although leading republicans say that further clarification is unlikely in the near future. Mr Major's pre-planned confrontation with Mr Paisley was intended to isolate his hardline Democratic Unionist party by demonstrating that threats and bluster will achieve nothing. Mr Major also wanted to provide a contrast between the DUP and the more constructive role played by Mr James Molyneaux's Ulster Unionist party. There were signs yesterday that the strategy was working. Mr Paisley compared Mr Major to Adolf Hitler, but ruled out taking his struggle to the streets. Mr Ken Maginnis, a senior UUP MP, accused Mr Paisley of 'harming the cause of unionism', confirming that the UUP will continue to go along with Mr Major. The big prize, however, is the prospect of a reciprocal ceasefire by the loyalist terrorist organisations. British ministers hope Mr Major's brusque rejection of Mr Paisley's attack on his integrity will reinforce the government's insistence that no secret deals have been done with the IRA. The indications are that the loyalist paramilitaries would probably call a halt to violence if fears of a 'sell-out' could be assuaged. Unionist leaders with paramilitary links warned yesterday that Tuesday's nationalist summit in Dublin was being interpreted by some as evidence of IRA influence. Officials in both capitals say that the peace process is at an extremely delicate stage and warn that an upsurge in loyalist violence or a republican refusal to clarify the ceasefire could cause a breakdown. Nonetheless, work is continuing on an inter-governmental 'framework' agreement, expected in the autumn, which will make detailed proposals for the future. If the ceasefire holds, that will be when the real tough talking starts. Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, told members of the Orange Order last night that there was no question of the British and Irish governments imposing a solution on the people of the province. He said in Belfast's Comber Orange Hall, that joint authority against the people's will would be incompatible with the principle of consent. A crowd of protesters gathered outside but the meeting ended without incident.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.     IEZ  Ireland, EC.   Industries:-  P9721 International Affairs.

Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, said: 'We are not insisting on a particular form of words. We just need to have an unequivocal assertion that they intend it should be over for good.' Sir Patrick's remarks appeared to indicate that a response based on republican intentions rather than specific wordings could be sufficient to open the door to exploratory talks with Sinn Fein. Referring to the British and Irish governments' differing interpretations of the IRA statements to date, he said he did not doubt Dublin's sincerity in accepting that the IRA had ended its campaign, but 'we have to be satisfied from what these people say themselves about their own intentions'. Sir Patrick met Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, last night at Hillsborough, the Northern Ireland secretary's official residence. The meeting was an attempt to agree a common response to the ceasefire and to discuss progress on a framework document on new constitutional arrangements for the province, due to be tabled at inter-party talks later this year. After the meeting, Sir Patrick said: 'Both of us share the common hope of seeing . . . a permanent end to violence.' However, the two ministers appeared to be no closer to agreeing on whether the IRA ceasefire was already a permanent cessation of violence. Mr Spring said: 'There is a desire by the republicans to be part of the democratic process . . . I would hope we can move on from here - that there will be no more violence from the republican side in Northern Ireland, and what is expected now is that there will be a reciprocation from the loyalist side.' He added: 'I personally believe that we can overcome any differences that have arisen.' Downing Street officials yesterday played down suggestions that Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein leader, was about to receive permission from the US authorities to make a tour of American cities. Leading Sinn Fein officials confirmed that they were examining the possibility of a visit to the US by Mr Adams and other senior republicans, including Mr Martin McGuinness, a member of Sinn Fein's executive. A Downing Street spokesman said the US government had given no formal indication to London that it was prepared to give visas to Sinn Fein officials. However, the spokesman made clear that Mr John Major, the prime minister, would prefer the US to refrain from granting Mr Adams a visa until Sinn Fein and the IRA had stated that the ceasefire would be permanent. Reacting to Sir Patrick's demands for a statement on republican intentions, Mr Tom Hartley, Sinn Fein's national chairman, complained the British were 'piddling about'. He said: 'The Irish government are taking the process forward. Will the British government not run with it. They're making the problem worse by just prevaricating.' Last night, speculation continued that the Ulster Volunteer Force, one of the main loyalist paramilitary groupings, might call its own ceasefire. Mr Chris Hudson, a Dublin trade union official who held talks with UVF representatives last week, said that among unionists 'there was definitely cautious optimism . . . that they were beginning to feel convinced there was no sell-out, no deals done, no secret agenda'.

0,FT941-9654 ,"FT941-9654 _AN-EBNCXABCFT 940214   FT  14 FEB 94 / Republicans' turn at the wheel: The next moves in the Northern Ireland peace process depend on Sinn Fein and the IRA declaring their hands      By MICHAEL CASSELL   Lasting peace - or the threat of descent into a paramilitary-led bloodbath? With the British and Irish governments keeping up the pressure on Sinn Fein and the IRA to declare their hand in the push for a 'new beginning', the people of Northern Ireland await the next decisive turn of events in their troubled history. Try as they may to convince the republican movement that no group will be allowed to hold to ransom those searching for progress in Northern Ireland, both governments have to acknowledge that the movement also holds the key to a real breakthrough. Impatient politicians north and south refuse to set deadlines, although they have been trying gently to push for a republican decision on the Downing Street declaration by the time of Sinn Fein's annual conference in two weeks. Yesterday, however, Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, slapped down the idea of an early response. In Ulster there are those who believe that, whatever his movement does or does not say in the short term, the historic tide has turned and that the peace process is now unstoppable. But others invoke history to predict failure and an unprecedented armed struggle. But if Sinn Fein's holding position becomes untenable and it is forced into making the next move, what are its options? If it were able to deliver an unequivocal 'yes' to the joint declaration - regarded as the least likely scenario by both governments - the immediate path ahead is clear. After a three-month ceasefire, Sinn Fein can join an exploratory dialogue covering security questions, participation in the political talks process and a start to demilitarisation in the province. But a 'yes' would require the British government to move quickly to reassure moderate unionists - who have accepted but never endorsed the declaration - that their position within the union remains secure. Their stance might certainly be tested to breaking point as Sinn Fein paid its first official call on Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary. For its part, Dublin would at once invite Sinn Fein to join the proposed all-Ireland Forum for Peace and Reconciliation. Mr Ian Paisley and his hardline Democratic Unionists would be even further out on a limb, maintaining their boycott of the talks process and standing aside from a 'treasonable sell-out'. The DUP is demanding that Mr John Major, the prime minister, abandons the declaration, although its attempt last week in a Belfast by-election to seek a mandate for its uncompromising stand failed badly. A more probable development, however, is that Sinn Fein might deliver qualified acceptance of the declaration, perhaps involving a temporary ceasefire. The gesture would switch the political initiative back to the two governments, again casting Sinn Fein as the party set on the search for peace and further probing any fault lines in the relationship between Dublin and London. Although both administrations have insisted that only a permanent ceasefire will do, there have already been hints that Dublin might see a respite in violence as sufficient grounds for allowing Sinn Fein to join the proposed forum. Sinn Fein would then have prised open the door marked 'concessions' a little further. But if Sinn Fein, for the sake of retaining republican unity, says 'no', Dublin - which has wanted the joint declaration to take priority over the talks process until Sinn Fein declared its hand - will be obliged to join London in pursuing the widest possible dialogue on the political way forward. The Irish government has set itself firmly against a return to the 'the bad old days of Stormont domination'. The unionists' priority will be for a devolved assembly along the lines set out during the 'three-stranded' talks. Mr James Molyneux, the Ulster Unionist leader, now says it could be up and running before the end of next year. The Social Democratic and Labour party, however, is deeply suspicious of what it can expect from an assembly. Sir Patrick and Mr John Hume, the SDLP leader, would have to work hard on relationships between the people of north and south in order to get the party to participate in a new chamber. The chances of making much progress, however, against a background of continuing violence might not be high. But while the political options ahead are aired, it is the reaction of those who have engaged in the tit-for-tat war of atrocities which is least predictable and most critical. Some believe that, if the latest initiative fails, the IRA will not be able to return to the old levels of violence without alienating many republicans brought to the brink of peace. 'They might be content to give people an occasional reminder, maybe on the mainland, that they are still in business', said one security source. But another warned: 'Any IRA 'no' in the form of new atrocities will see the loyalist paramilitaries go berserk. It could be the bloodiest year ever. And if republican violence ends, will loyalists put away their own arms and watch Sinn Fein at the negotiating table? They have their own agenda as well'. In spite of the talk of a security 'crackdown', the reality is that there are no secret weapons in the security forces' locker and they know they must be careful not to give the IRA any new opportunities for building fresh support. On Saturday, Mr Major and Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish premier, will meet before watching the England-Ireland rugby match at Twickenham and declare that the peace process continues. The reality will be that, off the pitch, the waiting game goes on.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.     IEZ  Ireland, EC.   Industries:-  P9721 International Affairs.

The Lynx helicopter was hit in the tail  and disabled by a Mark 15 mortar bomb as it hovered 100-feet  above the security force base at Crossmaglen in south Armagh.  Yet with supreme skill the crew managed to crash land the  aircraft inside the base -- avoiding private housing nearby.  They baled out in the dark during the terrifying incident on  Saturday night -- then went back to the helicopter as it began  to turn into a fireball. Despite their own injuries, they  rescued a seriously injured policeman who had been travelling  with them. Seconds later the helicopter exploded, sending a  fireball shooting into the sky.    At a press conference in Co [County] Armagh today, RUC  [Royal  Ulster Constabulary] Deputy Assistant Chief Constable Bill  McCreesh said that but for the skill and professionalism  displayed by the pilot and helicopter crew there could have been  a major tragedy. And he furiously condemned the IRA mortar  attack on the helicopter, launched over a residential area, as  ""lunacy.""    Although the helicopter was badly damaged, the pilot managed  to land it within the security force base. ""Had it come down in  the town itself many lives would have been put at risk,"" he  said. The mortar had been fired from the town square 150 yards  across local property into the base, he added.    It was the first time a mortar had been used to down a  helicopter and investigating officers were uncertain whether it  or the base was the target. There have a series of mortar bomb  attacks on the heavily-fortified joint Army and police border  station.    He slammed the IRA for an indiscrimate, reckless and  ruthless  attack which could have had horrendous consequences and again  displayed the terrorists' utter lack of human and Christian  feeling.    ""This mortar attack was not just an attack on an Army  helicopter but on the complete community of Crossmaglen. For  any bomber to launch a mortar from, and over, a residential  area, is a complete act of lunacy,"" said Mr McCreesh. [passage  omitted]    Local MP Seamus Mallon (Newry and Armagh) launched a verbal  broadside on Sinn Fein and the IRA for carrying out the attack  when they were spending their time talking about peace. The  Social and Democratic Party deputy leader said: ""I am very  angry. God knows how many people could have been killed in that  attack -- thankfully they weren't."" He said Northern Ireland  had gone back to the syndrome ""where we have Sinn Fein and their  spokesmen talking peace in the morning and carrying out these  murderous attacks through the IRA in the evening.""    ""I think that is what is revolting many people within this  country,"" Mr Mallon declared. [passage omitted]     "
0,FT934-5487 ,"FT934-5487 _AN-DLACFABOFT 931130   FT  30 NOV 93 / The IRA Connection: Mayhew chronicles the years of secret contact      By ROLAND RUDD   A chain of communications existed between the IRA and the British government for some years, and messages were conveyed indirectly in secrecy, Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, told the Commons yesterday. 'Clearly such a chain could only function if its secrecy was respected on both sides,' he said in a statement. In February a message from the IRA stated that it wanted a ceasefire so that it could begin a dialogue with the government, leading to peace. But it said it could not make such a move public - it argued that to do so would lead to confusion for the IRA volunteers, as the press would interpret it as a surrender. 'We cannot meet secretary of state's public renunciation of violence, but it would be given privately as long as we were sure that we were not being tricked,' it said. Sir Patrick said the government had a duty to respond to the message as it came from Mr Martin McGuinness, Sinn Fein's chief of staff. The government responded on March 19, confirming that if violence had 'genuinely' been brought to an end, whether or not that fact had been announced, dialogue could take place. The government had also made clear in the same message that 'no political objective which is advocated by constitutional means alone could properly be excluded from discussion in the talks process'. It said Sir Patrick had 'no blueprint' and that the government wanted an agreed accommodation, not an imposed settlement. In his statement, Sir Patrick said the government had accepted that the outcome of such a process could be a united Ireland, but only with the consent of the people of Northern Ireland. 'Should this be the eventual outcome of a peaceful democratic process, the British government would bring forward legislation to implement the will of the people here,' he said. However, unless the people of the province came to express such a view, Sir Patrick made clear that the government would continue to uphold the Union. He insisted: 'It is clear that this message was consistent with our declared policy: namely that if such people wanted to enter into talks or negotiations with the government they first had genuinely to end violence - not just temporarily, but for good.' Sir Patrick said the IRA's reply on May 10 'did not constitute the unequivocal assurance of a genuine end to violence on which we had insisted'. A temporary ceasefire would not do. Substantive contact resumed on November 2, when the IRA sent a message warning that Northern Ireland could be 'at the point of no return' and asking when dialogue would be opened. Sir Patrick said yesterday that the government's reply sent on November 5 said: 'Your message of November 2 is taken as being of the greatest importance and significance.' He said it repeated the government's insistence that there could be 'no secret agreements or understandings between governments and organisations supporting violence as a price for its cessation'. He said the reply insisted dialogue could only follow a permanent end to violent activity. Then a meeting could take place within a week of parliament's return in January. 'It is for the IRA and their supporters to explain why they have failed to deliver the promised ending of violence. They should do so at once.' Sir Patrick concluded by saying that if an end to violence was promised, the way would still be open for Sinn Fein to enter the political arena 'after a sufficient interval to demonstrate that they mean it'.

0,FT944-14548 ,"FT944-14548 _AN-EJWA8ABIFT 941022   FT  22 OCT 94 / Ulster Peace Process: Paisley calls move 'fresh IRA victory'      By JOHN MURRAY BROWN   The Rev Ian Paisley condemned Mr John Major's speech yesterday and accused the British prime minister, not for the first time, of reneging on his word. In contrast to the warm welcome from across the community for Mr Major's initiative to bring Sinn Fein into exploratory talks, a statement by Mr Paisley - issued from the DUP's Belfast headquarters even before the prime minister had made his address at the Europa Hotel  - described the speech as 'another victory for the IRA'. If Ulster's jigsaw is ever to be complete, Mr Paisley and his Democratic Unionist party represent one piece that still has to find a home. There are no doubt some people in the province's isolated rural communities who share this analysis. But as the peace process has inched forward, the perception grows that it is Mr Paisley, rather than hardliners on the nationalist side, who remains the obstacle to an agreement on a lasting peace. Mr Paisley has warned, often in apocalyptic terms, that the Downing Street declaration and the ensuing peace process has put the union under threat. He, more than other Protestant politicians, is implacably opposed to any suggestion that Dublin has a role to play in Northern Ireland - the basis for the cross-border institutions envisaged under the framework document now under discussion between London and Dublin. As for reform of the 1920 Government of Ireland Act, this is almost an article of faith. There are some who believe that Mr Paisley's deputy, the MP Mr Peter Robinson, may yet emerge as the voice of reason in broking a way to bring Mr Paisley in from the cold. But if that is the case, Mr Robinson's response to yesterday's announcement did not suggest a change of heart. Increasingly Mr Paisley appears out of step. While Mr Major has assiduously courted the support of Mr James Molyneaux's Ulster Unionists, he has made little effort to win over Mr Paisley, whose intemperate outbursts, culminating in his expulsion from Number 10 on September 7, have made him appear increasingly isolated. The tacit backing of Mr Molyneaux has been crucial in determining the pace at which Mr Major has proceeded. Even yesterday, in a statement aimed largely at nationalist opinion, Mr Major held out something for the unionists, with the proposal to restore what he called 'local accountability'. Dublin welcomed the proposal, but emphasised that this would be part of an overall agreement. Exactly how Mr Major's proposed assembly will be different from, and more durable than, earlier failed experiments in local administration is hard to imagine. Here again, unionists are split. The DUP has long favoured a complete devolution of powers, but is boycotting the talks being held with Mr Michael Ancram, the Northern Ireland minister. Mr Molyneaux on the other hand has long argued that devolution is a dilution of the union and a step towards separation. The road to a successful agreement is still strewn with pitfalls. If the main challenge for both Dublin and London is to get the Ulster Unionists and the moderate nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party together, moving ahead without Mr Paisley is fraught with danger. It is doubtful that Mr Paisley and his supporters can cause the massive union disruption of the 1970s strike. But the heady Paisley cocktail of unionism and fundamentalist Protestantism still commands considerable popular support, particularly in rural areas of Antrim and North Down, his stronghold. In Dublin at least, officials believe the next big hurdle to peace is to win the acquiescence, if not the explicit support, of Mr Paisley. The danger for Mr Molyneaux is that with Mr Paisley outside the process, Mr Molyneaux will face a barrage of attack. If the peace talks fail, Mr Paisley could once again emerge as the surviving stalwart of unionist interests.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P9711 National Security.

0,FT944-64 ,"FT944-64 _AN-FAAACADDFT 941231   FT  31 DEC 94 / Travel: Signs of hope under the wall - War and Peace (Travelling in Troublespots) / Jimmy Burns visits the Belfast front line      By JIMMY BURNS   It was at the far end of Cupar Street, West Belfast, in 1990 that I had first set eyes on Europe's last remaining political wall: a 20ft barrier of concrete and reinforced steel, zig-zagging through housing estates, churches, and factories, separating communities from each other on account of religion. The 'peace line' was erected 25 years ago by the security forces, with the support of both Protestant and Catholic residents. It still stands, a poignant symbol of political failure. The peace line cuts across the back garden of Colette Mcferran's small terraced house in Cupar Street and still blocks out the light from her sitting room. And yet, when I visited her, she sat talking of hope, a Catholic living in protestant-dominated Belfast. 'You know it's really strange but I'm not afraid to go out at night any more,' she said. 'You have to give it time, but the mood is changing. People are talking about the houses they would like to live in, and the schools they would like their children to go to, and the lottery.' Mcferran plays both the Irish and the British lotteries. It is this war-weariness, this desire to experience the ordinariness of life without bombs and bullets, that is making life difficult for the men of arms. For as the ceasefire continues, the collective sense of fear is gradually lifting. When I last visited Mcferran four years ago, she described at length how she and her Catholic neighbours felt harassed by the British army. She told me about the day three drunken soldiers had ripped the flowers from her garden and called her an Irish slut. Now she had a different story to tell, more in keeping with changing political realities. She described how her house had been taken over by the IRA. 'My daughter Sinead, who was then three, was sitting on my knee in the sitting room when these three IRA men kicked in my door and ran up the steps. They then started shooting from my upstairs window at the protestants across the wall.' Sinead was traumatised by the experience and had to undergo psychiatric treatment. Even now, at the age of seven, she still suffers from recurring nightmares and wets her bed. Whenever news about Northern Ireland comes on the TV she goes up and switches it off. The IRA has fewer friends than it once did in Catholic West Belfast. One of the greatest challenges facing the peacemakers of Northern Ireland is to change the attitudes of the children and young people, who have never known any other life than that dictated by political violence and sectarian hate. No one knows this better than Mina Wardle, a stress counsellor, who lives on the Protestant side of the peace line, a few blocks away from Mcferran, off the Shankhill Road. Wardle's life reflects the Troubles in microcosm. During the last 20 years, she has been the victim of armed robbery and death threats; she has tended to the mutilated victims of bombs, and seen a taxi driver shot dead outside her front door. Her first husband, an alcoholic, unable to cope with it all, beat and abused her until she had no option but to call in a friend in the Royal Ulster Constabulary. When I met Wardle in 1990, she was pessimistic about the future of Northern Ireland. As many local residents were being killed by paramilitaries as she was recruiting to her community workshop. She admits that such pessimism takes time and effort to erode, but she too feels a psychological change is taking place. 'After the IRA ceasefire, my son rang and asked what I thought about it. I told him I didn't think it was going to last. He said 'mum, don't be so cynical, you've got to give peace a chance. I just want to savour it. I want it to happen in my lifetime.' Then he broke down crying. That really touched me.' Wardle believes something fundamental was changing in Northern Irish society well before the ceasefire: the demoralising effect of so much of the violence and the sense of impotence that this generated among ordinary people, was giving way to a conscious effort to end tribal warfare. It was the IRA bomb attack on a political meeting above a fish shop in Shankhill Road in October last year (it left nine bystanders as well as the bomber dead and led to the inevitable retaliatory killings of another group of innocent Catholics in a pub near Derry) that cut through sectarian bigotry and provoked a catharsis. Neither the IRA nor their loyalist counterparts had any option but to consider suspending their military operations. 'Everyone involved in those killings felt they were in some way responsible and it generated a new way of thinking. All of a sudden people were united in wanting to claw back the value of life,' Wardle said. But wasn't the situation still fragile with both sides still holding back from handing in all their armoury, I asked? 'We have to believe that this is the end of it and that we cannot go back to a situation where people are prepared to kill themselves over a wee bit of land. You have to believe that tomorrow is going to be better than yesterday, otherwise you're never going to wake up,' she answered. Faith in a better, less violent future, the tentative thought - unimaginable a few weeks ago - that 1995 could be the year of peace in Northern Ireland has yet to break down the peace wall. But it is beginning to be shared by those whose minds were once set on protecting their kind by killing others. Twenty-one years ago Paddy Wilson and a woman friend were victims of a killing quite appalling even by Northern Ireland standards. Wilson, the then agent of the Catholic Gerry (now Lord) Fitt, and the woman were stabbed to death and mutilated. John White, the man charged with their murder and recently released after serving part of a life sentence, now sits in a recently furnished office off the protestant Shankhill Road, on the other side of the peace line from Cupar Street. He is a spokesman for the loyalist paramilitaries who have declared a ceasefire. The man responsible for what Lord Fitt describes as 'one of the most vicious murders in Northern Ireland history' looks fit and healthy, with his paramilitary tattoo on his right arm, and little repentance for past actions. White wants to talk only about the future. 'If I've changed my mind about violence, its not because of my prison experience but because of my analysis of the changing political situation - I realised that killing people was getting neither side anywhere and that it was futile. It was only alienating us from the community.' Yet change still has its parameters. Ask White about taking a bulldozer to the peace line and he will reject such an option, at least for now. He remembered the day it was put up. People were throwing petrol bombs at each other. He would be in favour of cutting a small door in the wall to allow people to move in and out during the day. It would close at nightfall. For he believes there remains a chilling threat of a return to violence. 'If rioting did break out again, it would degenerate into full-scale warfare. Stones would turn into guns, and violence would begin all over again. There needs to be compromise, but we have to move gradually,' he said. That night, I drove to Bombay Street, another Catholic ghetto which backs on to the peace line. I knocked without warning on the door of a local resident, who I knew was a political activist. Through a window I saw a youngish man, who had been sitting with his children, rise quickly and hide in the background. Only later, after extensive introductions through a family member, did he come forward. Martin McIlwee is leading a campaign to stop the peace line being taken down. His language remains unchanged as if the events of recent months were simply a cosmetic interlude in an ongoing process of ethnic cleansing. 'The day that wall gets taken down, the prods will be across, shouting 'Let's get those Fenian bastards'. If London is gearing up for another onslaught when the ceasefire breaks down, why shouldn't we.' So the collective catharsis has touched White, but not McIlwee. Quite how many fall into one camp or the other is impossible to say. Yet when I left Belfast this time it was neither White nor McIlwee that stuck in my thoughts, but Mcferran and her daughter Sinead. I remembered what parent and daughter had said about some British soldiers they had seen. Clutching her school books, Sinead butted in on our conversation and said: 'You know the soldiers make me laugh. They have pom poms on their hats which go round and round.' Her mother had a more ordinary explanation. 'It's very strange, you know, seeing soldiers without helmets. They look human.'   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

0,FT944-15807 ,"FT944-15807 _AN-EJQD5AB7FT 941017   FT  17 OCT 94 / Molyneaux backs further peace talks      By JAMES BLITZ and JOHN MURRAY BROWN      LONDON, BELFAST   Mr James Molyneaux, the leader of the Ulster Unionist party, has endorsed the prospect of negotiations between Sinn Fein and the British government. Amid clear indications that London will drop its insistence that an IRA ceasefire should be declared 'permanent', Mr Molyneaux said yesterday that negotiations between the British government and Irish nationalists would be a 'very, very important development'. The move came as the Irish government prepared in the light of the IRA and loyalist ceasefires to end a state of emergency that has existed in the republic since 1939. The UUP leader, speaking for the first time since the declaration last week of the loyalist ceasefire, said he did not see the word 'permanent' as an essential obstacle. Instead he told the BBC that the start of negotiations 'will mean that Her Majesty's government will be represented by intermediate-rank civil servants with a mix of intelligence officers to verify, to obtain from the IRA assurances . . . that their command structure has been disbanded'. His comments come amid strong expectations that Mr John Major will announce his government's readiness to initiate talks on the constitutional future of Northern Ireland in the next two weeks. A decision on such talks could be taken by the cabinet's Northern Ireland committee later this week. There is speculation that the government will make its intentions clear before a Commons debate on Ulster expected on October 26. Mr Molyneaux made clear yesterday that he did not expect the UUP to hold talks with Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein leader. Asked whether he would shake Mr Adams' hand, he replied: 'I don't quite see that happening for a long time because I don't see that we're going to be in the same company.' The remarks implied that Mr Molyneaux would like to see the peace process restricted to bilateral London-Sinn Fein talks. Speaking to the UUP conference at Carrickfergus on Saturday Mr Molyneaux also restated his party's misgivings about the peace process. He attacked as 'unworkable' the principle that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed. The republic's move to scrap the state of emergency, introduced in the second world war to deal with IRA activities, was described yesterday by Mr Dick Spring, the Irish deputy premier, as 'a powerful and symbolic way of saying that the national emergency is ended, and that a national nightmare is over'. Mr Spring told a meeting in Cork he would table proposals to revoke the 1976 Emergency Powers Act, introduced following the IRA murder in Dublin of British ambassador Christopher Ewart-Biggs and reinforcing earlier emergency powers, which allows the detention of terrorist suspects for a week without being charged. In the wake of the loyalist ceasefire Mr Martin MacGuinness of Sinn Fein raised the prospect of an early meeting with Mr David Ervine, representative of the loyalist paramilitaries.

0,FT944-17325 ,"FT944-17325 _AN-EJIA1AD7FT 941008   FT  08 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: Power but no glory      By MICHAEL SMITH   Did the electricity regulator get it right after all? Professor Stephen Littlechild drew strong criticism two months ago when he announced a set of price controls on regional electricity companies that sent share prices soaring to record levels. The view among politicians was that he had been too soft and even the City acknowledged he was less tough than he could have been. In the past six weeks or so, however, the shares have under-performed. In some cases, they have sunk to levels below where they were immediately before Littlechild's announcement. So, after three years of largely uninterrupted growth, has the bubble burst? The question will have particular concern for shareholders in Scottish Power and Scottish Hydro-Electric. When price controls were imposed on them last week, shares fell immediately as the market judged they had been given a tough time by the regulator. National Power and PowerGen, and Northern Ireland Electricity, have been feeling the breeze, too. Although not subjected to regulatory reviews recently, they have been hit by falls in the sector and the market. So what, then, are the prospects for electricity companies? In general, they remain at least reasonably good but there are some clouds around. The Labour party is perhaps the biggest threat. Although it seems to have ruled out re-nationalising the companies, it could impose a windfall tax on the profits of privatised utilities - a possibility confirmed this week by Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor. Although change is much less likely under the Tories, it cannot be ruled out. The government appears increasingly sensitive to criticism that the utilities, particularly electricity, are not policed tightly enough, and a cabinet committee is examining regulation. Politics apart, there is plenty of potential to keep shareholders smiling in the medium to long term, so reinforcing the arguments of Littlechild's critics. Some of the uncertainty surrounding most of the companies recently will lift in the next few months, particularly in the case of the regional electricity companies (RECs) in England and Wales. The main doubts for REC shareholders have centred on the National Grid, the transmission company which the companies plan to float next summer. The RECs are putting considerable effort into minimising the capital gains tax they will have to pay. The outcome of talks with the Inland Revenue could make a difference of up to Pounds 1bn in their bill, although most analysts believe the market has made allowance already for the worst scenario and that share values will grow when the details of flotation have been decided. Sorting out the National Grid will allow the companies to press ahead with other ways of improving share earnings. Most have started share buy-backs but completion will, in most cases, have to wait until after the results season, which starts next month and ends in mid-December. Analysts expect the results, from the first half of the year, to produce pleasant surprises. With Littlechild's review over, dividend growth is more likely to exceed expectations than disappoint them. Indeed, the City is expecting at least 6 to 8 per cent real growth a year from all RECs for the rest of the decade. For all of these reasons, analysts view the shares as good value. But there is less enthusiasm for the Scottish companies. Privatised later than the RECs, they have always been squeezed by tougher controls. Hopes that the regulator might ease these significantly in his review were dashed. The Scots have no National Grid to sell and no immediate plans to buy back shares. Most analysts think they have less scope to increase dividends, even if real growth is likely to be 5 per cent minimum a year. Even so, some analysts feel the Scottish shares have fallen too much since the review; they point out that both companies have potential to increase their unregulated earnings by exporting power to the rest of the UK. Nonetheless, the companies - Hydro, in particular - are struggling to overcome the feeling that their prospects are less exciting than those of the RECs. National Power and PowerGen are considered to have better basics although their shares have been unsettled recently. One reason was the uncertainty created by the government's sale next February of its remaining 40 per cent stakes in the companies. Another is the revival in the dash for gas by rivals: the more independent gas-fired stations that come on stream, the less room there is in the market for the two companies' older, coal-fired stations. A further problem is that they have agreed a deal with the electricity regulator under which they will try to sell off 6,000mw of capacity by the end of next year. Failure to do so could cause them to be referred to the Monopolies Commission, although that seems unlikely. But the two companies do have strong balance sheets and above-average dividend growth is expected of both: indeed, some analysts believe they can increase dividends by more than 15 per cent a year. Northern Ireland Electricity's image as sector star has been dented following the reviews involving the mainland companies. While these were under way, some investors bought NIE as a hedge against tough price controls in England, Scotland and Wales. Still, NIE continues to be regarded highly and, as it was privatised only last year, many of the rewards of cost-cutting lie ahead.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                          ELECTRIFYING FACTS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                     Market     Dividend                                 Pre-tax profits       Value      yield                             Year end    Pounds m    Pounds m    percent  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- East Midland Electricity       3/94        51.2      1,562.3       3.96 Eastern Group                  3/94       176.8      1,912.7       3.87 London Electricity             3/94       186.5      1,493.7       4.11 Manweb                         3/94       126.3        904.5       3.99 Midlands Electricity           3/94       195.4      1,514.0       4.06 National Power                 3/94       677.0      5,995.1       3.34 Northern Electricity           3/94       128.7        931.6       4.10 Norweb                         3/94       178.3      1,300.6       3.82 Northern Ireland Electricity   3/94        74.9        597.5       3.92 Powergen                       4/94       476.0      4,173.7       2.98 Scottish Hydro-Electricity     3/94       164.2      1,207.9       5.02 Scottish Power                 3/94       351.1      2,717.3       4.65 Seeboard                       3/94       131.7      1,013.2       3.64 South Wales Electricity        3/94       104.0        780.3       4.17 South Western Electricity      3/94       116.8        910.7       3.97 Southern Electricity           3/94       222.0      1,937.7       3.97 Yorkshire Electricity          3/94       149.0      1,447.8       4.23  -----------------------------------------------------------------------   Companies:-  Scottish Power.

The Lynx helicopter was hit in the tail  and disabled by a Mark 15 mortar bomb as it hovered 100-feet  above the security force base at Crossmaglen in south Armagh.  Yet with supreme skill the crew managed to crash land the  aircraft inside the base -- avoiding private housing nearby.  They baled out in the dark during the terrifying incident on  Saturday night -- then went back to the helicopter as it began  to turn into a fireball. Despite their own injuries, they  rescued a seriously injured policeman who had been travelling  with them. Seconds later the helicopter exploded, sending a  fireball shooting into the sky.    At a press conference in Co Armagh today, RUC [Royal Ulster  Constabulary] Deputy Assistant Chief Constable Bill McCreesh  said that but for the skill and professionalism displayed by the  pilot and helicopter crew there could have been a major tragedy.  And he furiously condemned the IRA mortar attack on the  helicopter, launched over a residential area, as ""lunacy"".    Although the helicopter was badly damaged, the pilot managed  to land it within the security force base. ""Had it come down in  the town itself many lives would have been put at risk,"" he  said. The mortar had been fired from the town square 150 yards  across local property into the base, he added.    It was the first time a mortar had been used to down a  helicopter and investigating officers were uncertain whether it  or the base was the target. There have a series of mortar bomb  attacks on the heavily-fortified joint Army and police border  station.    He slammed the IRA for an indiscrimate, reckless and  ruthless  attack which could have had horrendous consequences and again  displayed the terrorists' utter lack of human and Christian  feeling.    ""This mortar attack was not just an attack on an Army  helicopter but on the complete community of Crossmaglen. For  any bomber to launch a mortar from, and over, a residential  area, is a complete act of lunacy,"" said Mr McCreesh. [passage  omitted]    Local MP Seamus Mallon (Newry and Armagh) launched a verbal  broadside on Sinn Fein and the IRA for carrying out the attack  when they were spending their time talking about peace. The  Social and Democratic Party deputy leader said: ""I am very  angry. God knows how many people could have been killed in that  attack -- thankfully they weren't."" He said Northern Ireland  had gone back to the syndrome ""where we have Sinn Fein and their  spokesmen talking peace in the morning and carrying out these  murderous attacks through the IRA in the evening"".    ""I think that is what is revolting many people within this  country,"" Mr Mallon declared. [passage omitted]     "
0,FT934-5536 ,"FT934-5536 _AN-DLACFAABFT 931130   FT  30 NOV 93 / UK open to Sinn Fein talks: Optimism for peace grows as documents suggest IRA may lay down arms      By PHILIP STEPHENS, JIMMY BURNS and TIM COONE      LONDON, BELFAST, DUBLIN   The government last night declared it was ready to reopen contacts with Sinn Fein as hitherto secret documents suggested the IRA had been on the brink of ending its 25-year campaign of violence in Northern Ireland. An unapologetic defence by Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, of extensive contacts this year reinforced the impression at Westminster that Mr John Major believes the IRA may still lay down its arms. The optimism was echoed by Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, who said last night that there had already been a marked de-escalation of violence in recent weeks. Papers released by the Northern Ireland Office suggested there had been no large-scale IRA attacks since November 12 and Downing Street indicated that a declared cessation of violence lasting for two months or so might provide the background for formal talks with Sinn Fein. That in turn raised hopes that Mr Major and Mr Reynolds might inject momentum into the peace process at a summit which might take place as early as this Friday. However continuing differences between the two governments over the drafting of a joint communique at the summit were underlined last night by Mr Reynolds who said 'lots of progress will be required for a successful summit at this stage'. Government officials explained that Mr Reynolds was considering not holding the summit if progress could not be made on the communique beforehand. Sir Patrick's comments came after the startling disclosure that the government would have opened a dialogue with Sinn Fein as early as January 1994 if the IRA had kept an apparent pledge in November to end its campaign. But the government's account of the messages passed to and fro between the two sides from February to November - which Sir Patrick insisted did not amount to negotiations - was challenged vigorously by Sinn Fein. Mr Martin McGuinness, the leading Sinn Fein member involved in the contacts, accused Mr Major of fabricating some of the 30 or so pages of documents released in London. Most of the messages conveyed by what the documents refer to as 'the Provisional Movement' also suggest the IRA has not shifted from its position that Mr Major must accept that Ulster will eventually be part of a united Ireland. Sir Patrick, who weathered with relative ease a storm of criticism from hard-line unionists, told a crowded House of Commons that if the IRA ended the violence permanently 'the way would still be open for Sinn Fein to enter the political arena'. He insisted that the government's basic conditions for bringing Sinn Fein into the political process had not changed. The IRA would have to offer a permanent end to terrorism and the British government would not drop its constitutional guarantee on the status of Northern Ireland. That meant 'the key to peace is in the hands of the IRA'. But if current efforts failed, the government would keep exploring 'the opportunities for peace'. Downing Street said his statement had been approved by Mr Major and senior members of the cabinet at an emergency ministerial meeting earlier in the day to agree a response to the weekend revelations about the contacts. The Reverend Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionists, was suspended from the Commons after accusing Sir Patrick of lying. But his outburst was brushed off as a theatrical display by moderate unionists. Conservative MPs offered support for the government strategy and there was only muted criticism from Ulster Unionists. The most revealing document, dated November 5, sets out detailed arrangements under which the IRA would halt its campaign and start 'preliminary dialogue' with the government in mid-January. Sir Patrick said the offer had been in response to an explicit commitment to peace from the IRA, which was denied by Sinn Fein. Despite its insistence that basic conditions for Sinn Fein participation in talks had been as strong in private as in public, the documents revealed the government was prepared to offer considerable flexibility to Sinn Fein in arranging an end to hostilities. It told Sinn Fein that a declaration of a cessation of violence could initially be kept private. The government would then be ready to enter into a 'dialogue' within two or two-and-half months. Both offers appear considerably softer than Mr Major has yet admitted in public.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P9721 International Affairs.

0,FT933-13353 ,"FT933-13353 _AN-DGTCCACEFT 930720   FT  20 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Lib Dems split over Maastricht strategy      By RALPH ATKINS   A DIVISION among Liberal Democrat MPs last night over tactics for Thursday's Maastricht debate offered the government a possible lifeline in its efforts to avoid a defeat at the hands of Euro-sceptic Tories. Sir Russell Johnston, the Liberal Democrats' Europe spokesman, suggested his party's MPs might vote with the government to save the Maastricht treaty if Labour failed in its attempt to force Britain to accept the social chapter. A final decision by the 21 Liberal Democrat MPs will not be taken before tomorrow or possibly pending fresh legal advice on the implications of defeating the government. Sir Russell said, however: 'If the Labour amendment is defeated I think that the likelihood is that we will vote with the government - but it's not 100 per cent.' His comments were at odds with aides to Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, who said the party would vote against the government on both of Thursday's votes: the first on Labour's amendment backing the social chapter and the second on the government motion noting its opposition to the social chapter. The importance of the apparent rift is that Liberal Democrat support for the government on the second vote would force Tory Euro-sceptic MPs to concentrate on the first vote if they want to inflict a defeat on the government. They would have to vote for the social chapter rather than just against the government. The clash came as Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, again urged Unionist MPs to back the government, saying the province needed the social chapter 'like a hole in the head'. He is expected to meet Unionists on Thursday and appeared unwilling to rule out attempting to strike a deal. The three Democratic Unionist party MPs led by the Rev Ian Paisley announced they would vote against the government - except possibly if the government made a complete U-turn and abandoned the 1985 Anglo-Irish agreement. But the nine Ulster Unionist MPs will not decide how to vote until Thursday. They have not agreed tactics and although some want to back the Tory Euro-sceptics, others want to use the chance to force government concessions on Northern Ireland policy. Liberal Democrats want to put maximum pressure on the government to reverse Britain's social chapter opt-out but also do not want to wreck the treaty. Thus the party would be in a quandary if Labour's amendment were defeated. To then vote against the unamended government motion could mean no resolution being passed - possibly preventing ratification. Mr Ashdown wrote to Mr John Major, the prime minister, yesterday saying Liberal Democrats 'would use our votes in whatever way we felt would give Britain the best chance of being inside the social chapter'. He said that was the only way that Britain would be able to influence the development of the European social and employment policies.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

0,FT941-4712 ,"FT941-4712 _AN-ECJDQACCFT 940310   FT  10 MAR 94 / Peace slips further from grasp: A look at the damage to the talks process      By DAVID OWEN and MICHAEL CASSELL   British and Irish ministers will meet in London today in the aftermath of last night's failed IRA mortar spectacular. They will be even more determined to demonstrate that there will be no let up in the search for peace in Northern Ireland. Privately, however, they concede they face a long hard haul. The window of opportunity, opened with December's Downing Street declaration, appears to be creaking shut. The early hopes of imminent peace, today even more difficult to sustain, have become bogged down in political diversions which threaten to derail the two governments' initiative. For London and Dublin, the challenge more than ever is to keep the show on the road, to build on the genuine consensus which now exists between the two governments and to insist that their broader, bolder objectives will not be sidetracked by mortars or sub-plots. It is not going to be easy. The wave of mass killings last autumn, which gave impetus to intensified Anglo-Irish efforts to forge a durable settlement, has subsided, lowering the sense of urgency which underpinned a renewed readiness among the province's political parties to compromise. On the political front, the European elections beckon. As a result, the province's main political parties are already adopting a markedly more aggressive tone in discussing the prospects for a settlement. The Ulster Unionists are particularly mindful of the need to protect their flank against the Rev Ian Paisley's hardline Democratic Unionists. London has all but abandoned hope of reaching the stage where round-table talks between Ulster's main non-violent parties and the two governments can be resurrected until the elections are out of the way. In Dublin there is also, in the words of one Northern Ireland Office official, 'an acute awareness of the Ulster calendar'. In addition, the lengthening silence from Sinn Fein - punctuated by potentially murderous assaults - is increasingly being seen in both capitals as the republican movement's way of saying no to the declaration. A surprise acceptance or semi-acceptance, even now, has not been completely ruled out. But few expect anything from Sinn Fein that would enable any significant headway to be made this side of Euro-polling day on June 9. Not surprisingly, both governments are playing down expectations for today's session. All the more so since attention is expected to focus on strand two of the three-stranded process: relations between Dublin and the north. This, by common consent, is the most difficult circle the talks process will have to square. As Lord Fitt, the former leader of the Roman Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party, told his fellow peers last week: 'It is strand two that will cause all the difficulties. It has done so in the past and will undoubtedly do the same again in the future.' Today's meeting will take stock of the position, which was in effect done at last weekend's meeting in Dublin between Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland Secretary, and Mr Dick Spring, Irish Foreign minister. It will also discuss progress made by the liaison committee, set up after last month's so-called Twickenham summit between Mr John Major, the prime minister, and Mr Albert Reynolds, his Irish counterpart, in reaching a common position on the way ahead. But it is thought too early for significant progress to have been made, making it difficult to publicly demonstrate that the initiative is gathering momentum. Today's meeting will not attract the fanfare that surrounded the Downing Street declaration or the publicity generated by last night's airport raid. But, although peace is apparently as elusive as ever, the intervening two months has done nothing to undermine the quiet determination in London and Dublin to try to finish what they started in September.

0,FT923-3580 ,"FT923-3580 _AN-CIKCNAB5FT 920911   FT  11 SEP 92 / Arts: A place where history is not forgotten - Northern Ireland's museum trail      By PATRICIA MORISON   TO describe Northern Ireland as off the normal beat for arts writers is perhaps an understatement. However, an unusual promotion, a brochure entitled Museums of Ulster, The European Connection, sponsored by the European Arts Festival, hopes to change that. Nine museums in Ulster have collaborated in the making of the brochure which is funded by an EEC grant of Pounds 10,000. Their aim is to put their permanent collections on the tourist map. From any other region of the UK, such a modest initiative would appear worthy but dull, but because this is Northern Ireland, matters looked more promising. For a start, given the perception of the province in the wider world, an invitation to 'take a voyage through the history of Ireland and Europe' appears more in the nature of a challenge. And then there are the interesting questions such a voyage raises. How is history to be packaged for presentation amid a population bitterly divided by memories, grievances, prejudices, and bloodshed? The brochure picks up the European theme of the Festival by highlighting exhibits which illustrate Ireland's cultural links to continental Europe. A visit to Derry brought education in treacherous place-names. The 'London-' on the roadsigns along the road to the city has been painted out, and the brochure referred to the new Tower Museum at Derry in County Londonderry. So in at least one official circle, it looks as though the use of Londonderry for the city has been dropped, in deference to the nationalist view that it is an indefensible, unhistorical Anglicisation. The Tower Museum, opening at the end of this month, surveys the history of Derry, one of the oldest cities in Ulster. It dates back to the 6th Century in the eyes of those who see its founder as St Columba. Derry's more recent history that has blackened its reputation. In the Troubles in the 1970s, one-third of Derry's city-centre was destroyed. However, since the mid-1980s there has been much rebuilding and a determined attempt, using funds from the EEC, to promote the city's heritage to attract tourism. The plan deserves to work. Except for its bad days, mercifully rare in the past four years, Derry appears as a charming and congenial place. The old city, up high overlooking the valley of the River Foyle, has streets of well-restored Georgian town-houses, the only intact city-walls in Ireland, and an exuberant arts scene which leaves Belfast looking decidedly stodgy. Brian Lacey, director of Derry's museums, sees his task as made easier for having one world-famous event to promote: the Siege of Derry of 1689. At the siege, King James II and his Catholic army (including troops sent by Louis XIV) were frustrated by the dogged endurance of the Protestant defenders of Derry, who for 105 days held the city for William III. It needs tact and a certain courage to make a museum display out of an event which rates with the Battle of the Boyne as sacred moments in the annals of Protestant Ulster. Lacey himself is from the Republic, something not at all uncommon in the museum world, where cross-border links are getting closer. The majority of the inhabitants in Derry is Catholic and nationalist, so Lacey had no idea what to expect when he mounted an exhibition in 1989 devoted to the Siege. On the day of the opening, the Provisional IRA blew up a pub by the museum car park. It was a warning: this could have been your museum. Since then, Lacey's feeling is that the atmosphere in Derry has improved considerably. The Tower Museum itself is a curious structure, built in the 1980s as a symbol of Derry's renewal. The finale remains to be settled. It may come up as far as the late 1970s, and include rubber bullets, posters and letters written on lavatory-paper by Bobby Sands, the republican hunger-striker who died in 1981, and smuggled out of prison. But a video made about the Troubles has already fallen foul of the politicians. Some of them urge that the subject be dropped altogether, a solution Lacey reprehends as 'dishonest and lopsided'. Even without it, local sensitivities could always be inflamed, very probably by the effigy of Lundy. A 'lundy' in Northern Ireland parlance is a traitor. According to the Protestant version, Robert Lundy was the governor who during the siege treacherously betrayed King William's trust by shinning down a pear-tree which grew beside the city wall and disappearing. Until recently, Lundy was a - literally - explosive symbol of Protestant supremacy, because every December the Apprentice Boys used to stuff his effigy with fireworks and hang it from the Walker Pillar. Down in the mean, terraced streets of the Bogside, the Catholic population returned the fire - metaphorically on this occasion - by setting their chimneys alight. Nine years ago, the Provos blew up the Walker Pillar, so Lundy now meets his annual fate on the steps of the court-house. At the charming Ulster Folk and Transport Museum at Holywell, County Down, pains are being taken to get the denominational mix correct in reconstructing historic churches in the expanding 'village' which is the centrepoint of the museum. Museum staff talking as if simply to get Catholics and Protestants under the same roof to enjoy the same experiences, marks a victory - whether it be jewellery from the famous Armada wrecks at the Ulster Museum in Belfast or wildlife videos at the recently refurbished Fermanagh County Museum at Enniskillen. On this simplest of criteria, museums hardly need to tackle difficult subjects. Their justificiation for seeking larger grants from local authorities, central government, and the EEC is their contribution to 'Education for Mutual Understanding', or Emu. At Down County Museum in Downpatrick, staff regularly teach children from Protestant and Catholic schools, folk-traditions, such as the rituals for St Brigid's Day. On March 17, St Patrick's Day, a strange medley of events, from pipe bands to tractor clubs, brings over 3,000 visitors to the museum, a stone's thrown from the legendary burial place of the saint. Director Brian Turner demurred at my suggestion that he was bringing the two communities together. For him there is just the one community, and no reason whatsoever why it should not take pride in the mysterious, but mercifully ecumenical, figure of St Patrick, 'one of the few things in Northern Ireland which is a world attraction.' In all these museums, one senses a particularly strong emphasis on reaching out to children. In 1991, a survey conducted in Northern Ireland on public attitudes towards museums showed that four in 10 adults said they never went and 'most of the remainder' visited only once every two or three years. Protestants went more than Catholics. However, the survey also showed that Protestants and Catholics alike see museums as a vital resource for preserving the province's history and cultural traditions, and that they consider museums give an unbiased presentation of history. In terms of Emu, then, school outings seem to be the crux of the relationship between museums and their public. On the other hand, time alone will tell whether taking children to museums has any lasting impact on the social stereotypes, incomprehension, and hatred. Meanwhile, at the Ulster Museum in Belfast, an astoundingly profitable exhibition bought in from the US has pulled in more than 150,000 visitors this summer, mostly children, to gawp at lunging, roaring dinosaurs. Director John Nolan's gamble has paid off and this expensive show have wiped out seven years of accumulated debt. He answers critics by pointing out this blockbuster also plays its part in contributing to Emu by attracting so many people, often first-time callers, to the museum. The problem is the pressure on space which means masterpieces of the museum's fine art collection, such as Turner's The Origin of Christianity, are put in store. There is pressure for a separate art gallery to be built in Belfast. This month, the Museum offers compensation with a large exhibition of its own drawings and watercolours, previously seen in the US, and Sir James Lavery's bequest of his paintings goes on show in November. But for the genuinely curious visitor from abroad, even dinosaurs make their point about life in Northern Ireland. On a damp August morning, there was not a soldier to be seen as queues waited for the museum to open. Inside, the dinosaurs' lair was a pandemonium of children screaming with delight. Every day people had been asking me, 'So how do you find the place?'. Right then - but not for the only time - my answer would have been 'just like anywhere else'.

Amid pessimism in Whitehall about the prospects for an end to the violence in Northern Ireland, it was clear last night that the government would go no further than to restate the principles underlying last December's declaration. Ministers agreed that the response should not be open to charges that it was obstructing genuine peace overtures from Sinn Fein. Downing Street is also anxious to avoid a serious rift with Dublin in spite of irritation at comments in the US earlier this week by Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister. Good relations with Dublin are vital if, after next month's European elections, the government is to relaunch its efforts to secure a political settlement in Northern Ireland and a successor to the 1985 Anglo-Irish agreement. But ministers agreed that the government could not be seen to be 'sitting an examination paper' set by the IRA. Mr Major believes the government cannot pre-empt any decisions or agreements reached in discussions with the province's constitutional parties, which would give Sinn Fein an advantage while the IRA continues its campaign of violence. In spite of Mr Reynolds' apparent hopes that Mr Gerry Adams still wants an end to the conflict, British ministers are sceptical about the Sinn Fein president's intentions.

0,FT934-12079 ,"FT934-12079 _AN-DJ1C4ADGFT 931028   FT  28 OCT 93 / Leading Article: Bombed out in Belfast      BOMBS AND REVENGE killings in Northern Ireland prompt   once again - rhetoric and political introspection in London. The British government has a two-pronged strategy: use the security forces to combat the IRA and protestant terror gangs, and keep talking to the Irish government and Ulster politicians, but not to terrorists or their apologists, such as Mr Gerry Adams. A desired outcome of the talks, conducted within the framework of the Anglo-Irish agreement, is a comprehensive political settlement, including devolution of administrative authority to a locally-elected assembly in Belfast. Tragically, this strategy is not working. The IRA bomb in the Shankill road and this week's reprisals by 'loyalists' have raised the spectre of a growing civil war in the streets of Belfast. It is dismally clear that the conditions have not yet been found in which the province's main political actors are prepared to make the sacrifices of compromise. In this situation, the British government has limited powers of persuasion, but it is time to re-examine the approach both to security and political negotiation, as well as opening up a third dimension, the use of economic leverage. On the security front, there are no new ideas, but an old one which continues to exert attractions, namely internment without trial of 'known' terrorist leaders. Last time this was tried, as the Northern Ireland secretary, Sir Patrick Mayhew, has pointed out, it was counter-productive. Locking up killers keeps them from their grisly work, but others would do some of it for them while the IRA's overseas friends would have a field day. Internment might, however, be a worthwhile weapon of counter-insurgency if deployed at the right moment and in the right political context. It would require that action be taken against terrorists on both sides of the religious divide and would be effective only if the Irish government simultaneously detained IRA activists living within its own boundaries. Such a package would at least show determination by both the British and the Irish governments to co-operate on security. Although unionist leaders applaud the idea of internment for IRA activists, they would probably see double-edged internment as a tilt towards Dublin. It would be for the prime minister to convince them that such a move could be an effective accompaniment to a decisive political step, involving the transfer of substantial powers of government from Westminster to Belfast. The message could be pressed home by making it clear that, without such political progress, London will not tolerate the continued massive drain of public funds into Ulster at a time of acute budgetary constraints. The idea of Mr Major getting tougher on these matters may seem fanciful when he depends upon the Ulstermen to bolster a shaky Commons majority of 17. If the prime minister cannot rise above this political constraint, he will see no end to Ulster's sea of troubles.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Sinn Fein  cannot complain that the declaration has not been clarified. It  has been explained time and time again by political leaders in  Ireland and Britain.    Today, in the Irish News, British Prime Minister John Major  makes an impassioned plea to Sinn Fein to accept the declaration  as the basis for a settlement of the problems facing this  country. It is one of the most significant contributions to the  debate since the declaration was unveiled in London in December.    Mr Major is not alone in hoping the Sinn Fein ard fhets [as  published] will take a permanent and courageous step towards  democracy. The declaration has gained the support of the  overwhelming majority of people in Ireland and in Britain; and  it is seen as the basis for peace with honour in other countries  sympathetic to the Irish cause.    The thrust of the party's policies over the past decade  makes  the final step to full democracy inevitable, its leaders realise  that; now its members must accept that their party can only play  a full and vital role in Ireland when their policy direction  reaches its logical conclusion.    One of the most important paragraphs in Mr Major's article  is  addressed directly to Sinn Fein. He says:    ""Sinn Fein claims not to understand the place of the  declaration in the `peace process'. There is nothing obscure  about this... The declaration is not a peace plan, it certainly  isn't a solution on its own. It is simply the view of the two  governments about the principles involved in a process leading  to an agreed outcome. Those central principles are democracy,  and an absence of coercion -- in other words consent, no outside  interference and an end to violence.""    The message to Sinn Fein is clear. No agreed outcome has  been pre-ordained by either government; and, if it rejects  violence, it will be able to play a full and unfettered part in  the debate which leads to that agreed outcome.    Today's article by Mr Major is couched in the language of  friendship and reconciliation. And he does not shy away from  some of the key concerns of the Sinn Fein leadership. He is  blunt on the issue of what he means by exploratory talks.    In his January 8 interview with the IRISH NEWS Mr Adams  asked  for clarification on what the exploratory talks would involve.  He asked if it meant more than just a discussion with Sinn Fein  about how the IRA could hand over its weapons. Mr Major says  clearly today that these talks would be meaningful.    ""We would be ready within three months of an end to violence  to begin an exploratory dialogue with Sinn Fein. Its aims would  be to discuss how Sinn Fein would become involved in the  three-stranded political talks, how they could be brought fully  into normal political life in Northern Ireland, and what the  consequences of ending violence would be... I believe this  amounts to a substantial exploratory agenda. Those exploratory  discussions would themselves be part of the process of bringing  Sinn Fein back into normal political life, in developing a  normal political dialogue between the government and other  parties, on matters like education, housing, health care, crime  and fair employment.""    That is a clear and positive statement which should  encourage  Sinn Fein to become involved, Mr Major is not just offering  talks on a narrow agenda.    Mr Major has also been unambiguous about the meaning of  self-determination, as he sees it. He re-emphasises his  government's position that it has no ""selfish, strategic or  economic interest in Northern Ireland"", and he goes on to say:  ""we would have no wish to frustrate the democratically expressed  wishes of the people.""    The primary policy objective of the British government, he  says, is ""to see peace, stability and reconciliation established  by agreement among all the people who inhabit the island.""    Britain wants to encourage agreement -- agreement which  would  include an input from Sinn Fein if it enters the democratic  process fully. And he pledges to introduce any legislation  necessary to give effect to that agreement which ""the people who  live in Ireland may themselves freely so determine without  external impediment.""    No Sinn Fein president could disagree with his comment ""it  is  not the government's job to tell the Irish people what they  should think or to dictate to them where their future should  lie.""    Rightly, Mr Major has said that the political talks -- on  the  three-strand basis which protects Irish interests -- must  continue. The opportunity for Sinn Fein must continue. The  opportunity for Sinn Fein to become involved is there. And he  takes up the theme of partnership both within Ireland and  between the British and the Irish. This aspect is critical if  we are to copper-fasten any agreement with economic  regeneration; and is particularly important in the context of  the two nations' membership of the European Union.    Calling for an end to violence, Mr Major spells out the  consequences: ""we shall in time be able to manage without  British soldiers in support of the RUC [Royal Ulster  Constabulary] and without emergency legislation""; greater  protection of civil rights; new institutions ""reflecting the  common interests in the island""; and closer partnership.    He does not try to limit or dictate the scope of agreement.  ""Whatever may be the shape of final agreement in the talks, it  will not be imposed on anyone. It will be the people who will  have decided.""    His acknowledgement that ""dreadful deeds have been done by  all"" is generous, as is his regret. His plea that ""our  generation must look to the future"" is one which should be the  motivating force for all those capable of advancing the cause of  peace in Ireland.     "

The most recent in the latest spate of terrorist outrages just 24 hours later underlines the depths of the morass from which they are seeking to lift the province. Both sides are aware that as long as the political vacuum remains then the spiral of violence will continue, and quite possibly escalate. But after more than 20 bloody years neither can be confident that the political initiative on which they have embarked can avoid the roadblocks which have halted so many of its precursors. The lengthy communique released after the talks in Brussels renounced terrorism, declared that there could be no place at the negotiating table for those who used violence to further political aims, and underlined the central role of the Ulster constitutional parties in any settlement. This might seem to represent no more than a statement of the obvious, but the very fact of its release sent an important message: that Mr Major and Mr Reynolds were ready to expend political capital in a resumed effort at permanent peace, and that in the process both were prepared to own up to some obvious realities. From Dublin the message was that it was now ready to remove what Mr Major saw as two of the most foremost obstacles to peace. As part of an overall settlement, Mr Reynolds would be ready to ask the voters of the republic to remove from the Irish constitution its claim to jurisdiction over the north, and the republic would recognise explicitly the veto over change in the province exercised by supporters of the union. For its part London would now state publicly what had always been obvious but never admitted so explicitly by a British government: that if the IRA ceased its military campaign a place would be found at the negotiating table for Sinn Fein. Behind the scenes Mr Major has also acknowledged that the quid pro quo for changes in the republic's constitution would be a significant increase in administrative co-operation between north and south. Over the next few weeks the two governments will seek to build on that agreement, starting at the meeting on Wednesday between Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, and Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary. Mr Major and Mr Reynolds will seek to strengthen it further at a UK-Irish summit in Dublin within six weeks. The aim is to create an atmosphere which will persuade the constitutional parties - above all the unionists - to return to the negotiating table to thrash out an internal political settlement. Reassurance for the unionists ran right through the Major-Reynolds statement: in the promise that there would be no secret deals; in the joint disavowal of the initiative launched by Mr John Hume, the SDLP leader, with Mr Gerry Adams of Sinn Fein; and in Dublin's implicit acknowledgement of the unionist 'veto'. In practice, the two governments are reversing the order of negotiations in the three-strand peace process which stalled at the end of last year. Then the priority was an agreement between the Northern Ireland parties before moving on to the second and third strands - relations between north and south in Ireland and an agreement between the republic and Britain on Ulster's constitutional status. Now the aim is to secure a broad measure of agreement on strands one and two as an umbrella for negotiations on strand one. But if the logic of a London-Dublin accord providing a catalyst for the restart of talks between the parties in the province is obvious enough, its chances of success are precarious. The unionists, whose self-importance is bolstered by Mr Major's reliance on their votes at Westminster, must be persuaded that the talks offer something better than the status quo. Mr James Molyneaux, leader of the Ulster Unionist party, is now the most important player in the game. Without a positive response from him, the latest initiative will go nowhere. Mr Hume, badly bruised by the rejection of his initiative, must also be brought back within the inter-governmental process. He remains as convinced as ever that a cessation of violence by the IRA is within reach if Mr Major is prepared to listen carefully to the ideas to which Sinn Fein has put its name. He has staked too much on his talks with Mr Adams to withdraw quietly now. Yet British officials were suggesting yesterday that the picture beneath the surface was not as bleak as the familiarly unpromising rhetoric of Ulster politicians may suggest. Mr Molyneaux has remained silent. If he offered to return to the negotiating table, both Mr Hume and the Rev Ian Paisley, the leader of the hardline Democratic Unionist party, would find it hard not to join him. The good intentions might this time offer at least a start on the road to an agreement.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.     IEZ  Ireland, EC.   Industries:-  P9721 International Affairs.

0,FT934-12907 ,"FT934-12907 _AN-DJYCQAAIFT 931025   FT  25 OCT 93 / Bomb puts Ulster peace talks in doubt      By PHILIP STEPHENS and Our Belfast Correspondent   THE Hume-Adams initiative to end the fighting in Northern Ireland appeared doomed last night as Mr John Major led a fierce denunciation of the IRA's bombing of a busy Belfast street. As the death toll from Saturday's attack in the Protestant Shankill Road rose to 10, including one of the terrorists who planted the bomb, Mr Major ruled out early dialogue with the Republican Sinn Fein movement. Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, and Mr Dick Spring, Ireland's foreign affairs minister, announced they had postponed a meeting of the Anglo-Irish inter-governmental conference on Wednesday. Mr Spring had been expected at that meeting to pass on to Sir Patrick details of the Hume-Adams plan. Sir Patrick is expected to make a House of Commons statement later today. British ministers expect that the London and Dublin governments will now press ahead with their own efforts to devise a new constitutional settlement to provide an umbrella for fresh talks between the legitimate political parties in the province. In the wake of Saturday's massacre Ulster Unionists demanded an end to the so-called peace initiative framed by Mr John Hume, leader of the nationalist Social Democratic Labour party, and Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president. Mr Hume called on the two governments to speed up their consideration of the proposals, which he said offered the best hope in 20 years of ending sectarian violence in the province. However, Mr Major, who is expected to hold talks with Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, during Friday's European Community summit in Brussels, said the bombing had seriously undermined hopes for dialogue. Speaking at the Commonwealth summit in Cyprus, Mr Major said he wanted one message from the IRA: 'We have given up violence for good.' He added: 'The message I want to hear is quite clear. It is quite simple. But I haven't heard it yet.' Apparently dismissing the Hume-Adams proposals, the prime minister said: 'I have read about it, I have heard about it, but I have not seen it.' Senior ministers added the bombing had reduced to 'practically zero' the already slim prospect that Mr Hume's efforts could lead to participation by Sinn Fein in talks to secure a political settlement in Ulster. One member of the cabinet said the government would be accused - and rightly so - of bowing to the terrorists if it opened contacts with an organisation which explicitly supported IRA terrorism. Mr Reynolds said the bombing was another atrocity which showed that the path of violence led nowhere. He said: 'All sides, even at this late stage, must desist from killing and allow the dialogue to develop between those who believe in peace.' Mr Adams said last night that the bombing had been 'wrong' after the IRA indicated that it had intended to give a warning before the bomb was detonated, but that it had exploded prematurely.

Their Land Rover was rocked by a blast as it drove along  Spencer Road, in the Waterside area of Londonderry, shortly  before midnight.    The RUC [Royal Ulster Constabulary] confirmed that one male  officer was killed, and two others ""very seriously injured"" in  the attack.    Early today a spokesperson at the town's Altnagelvin  Hospital  said the two injured officers were in ""a very serious condition"".    The blast was heard over a wide area of Londonderry.  Security forces sealed off the largely commercial road before  beginning a search operation.    An RUC spokesman said the attack was being treated as ther  work of the IRA.    Earlier in the evening, a man was shot and injured at a  police checkpoint in South Armagh.    Police said the man was taken to hospital suffering from a  leg wound after a number of shots were fired by police at a  civilian vehicle. Another man was arrested.    An investigation was mounted after the incident at Ballsmill  Road near Silverbridge.    The scene is a few miles from Crossmaglen, where a major  security operation has been mounted in recent days at the start  of major re-building work at the village security base which has  been regularly attacked by the IRA.

The initiative, launched 11 days ago in Belfast, is aimed at ending the paramilitary violence in Northern Ireland. Mr Hume spent almost two hours explaining the initiative to Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, and Mr Dick Spring, the foreign minister. Mr Reynolds said afterwards: 'John Hume gave us a document setting out the broad principles, which all of us agree could be a just and a lasting peace process to be established and worked upon. We will evaluate what we have heard today with our colleagues in government and we will consider how, in our discussions with the British government, this can contribute to the building of a peace process.' Government officials confirmed that the document was the same report referred to by Mr Hume and Mr Adams in their joint statement launching the peace initiative. The foreign ministry said: 'We will certainly contemplate discussing it with the British government as part of a wider process leading to a settlement (on Northern Ireland)'. Mr Reynolds said the document itself would not be presented to the British government. Mr Hume said: 'I gave a very detailed briefing on a strategy for peace that I believe now exists and I am quite happy with the (government) response.' Neither he nor the Irish government is likely to release any further details of the initiative. Mr Hume appealed to the media for patience, saying: 'The less speculation and more confidentiality the better. As they showed in Norway (in the Middle East peace process) secrecy helped create agreement there.' The Northern Ireland Office did not wish to comment, but Mr Ken Maginnis, deputy leader of the Ulster Unionist party, was deeply suspicious of the secrecy surrounding the initiative. 'Is it reasonable that we should be expected to react positively on the basis of some hypothetical document that in fact was probably cobbled together on the way back from John Hume's trip to America?' he asked. The Irish cabinet is to discuss the proposals next Tuesday. Mr Reynolds said on Wednesday he believed any negotiated settlement should be put to a 'simultaneous' referendum north and south of the border, but he reaffirmed the Unionists' effective right to veto any new constitutional arrangement for the province, as established in the 1985 Anglo-Irish treaty.

Mr Reynolds, who last week relayed to London a list of  questions from the IRA's political arm, briefed United States  President Bill Clinton on developments before returning from his  short trip to America today. After arriving at Dublin airport  he said all sides in the Northern Ireland conflict should now  take the opportunity to end the obstruction towards peace caused  by the long-running clarification dispute. He repeated his  opposition to any renegotiation of the five-month-old peace  document he and John Major signed but said if there were genuine  issues of clarification it was for the British Government to  deal with the matter. There was now an opportunity for everyone  to put the issue of clarification behind them and he said he  believed the requests were ""answerable"" by Britain.    Downing Street said later the Government would consult with  Dublin on the terms of its response to Sinn Fein's document of  questions but a spokesman insisted the Government's views on not  clarifying the declaration had not changed -- and there would be  no negotiations on it.    ""What the people of Northern Ireland want from Sinn Fein and  the IRA is an immediate and permanent end to violence, not  months of procrastination while violence continues,"" the  spokesman said.    But Mr Reynolds, who had two meetings with President Clinton  in Indianapolis on Saturday, said it was important to get back  on the road to talks and bring an end to violence.    Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams today demanded ""honest,  unambiguous and forthright"" answers to the questions and said  Sinn Fein had taken a number of initiatives to remove the  clarification obstacle.    He said the British Government ""needs to adopt an equally  positive attitude"", adding: ""Mr Major must move to close the gap  of distrust between us. Therefore London should respond  positively and in an unambiguous way to the questions we have  transmitted to them through the Dublin Government. ""Our specific  questions should be answered in a direct and comprehensive  manner. It is vital that London's response is honest and  forthright.""    But Ulster Unionists today warned the Government not to  negotiate in public with the IRA. The party's security  spokesman Ken Maginnis said that would be a ""dangerous road to  go down"" and that the IRA was not ready to give up violence.    ""The IRA...is clearly not prepared to cease violence at this  particular time, so any exercise is both futile and an  indication to the IRA that the Government is weakening,"" he  added. [passage omitted]    Mr Reynolds later told BBC's One O'Clock News: ""There will  be  no negotiation of the Downing Street declaration. We have said  that time and time again.    ""But if there are genuine areas of clarification that are  required then let the British Government deal with that matter.""     "
0,FT942-2168 ,"FT942-2168 _AN-EFUD5AB9FT 940621   FT  21 JUN 94 / Mayhew hints at resurrecting internment      By DAVID OWEN and TIM COONE   Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, yesterday gave his strongest hint yet that the government is considering internment as part of its response to the upsurge in sectarian violence in the province. His comments came as the UK government signalled that a meeting between Mr John Major, the prime minister, and Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, this week could give new impetus to efforts to forge a lasting settlement in Ulster. Downing Street made clear it had not ruled out reaching a framework agreement on new constitutional arrangements in time for the next Anglo-Irish summit next month. On Friday Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, gave a gloomier assessment, warning that the document was unlikely to be completed in time for the summit. As the first victims of the latest outbreak of sectarian violence were buried, Mr Gerry Adams added his voice to those urging republicans not to retaliate for Saturday night's shooting in which six Roman Catholic men were killed by loyalists. The president of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, appealed to 'those I represent' for calm and restraint. He said republican leaders would reconvene to discuss Sinn Fein's response to last year's Downing Street Declaration 'within days'. With pressure again mounting on London and Dublin to show that their efforts are making headway, officials representing the two governments are understood to be working from the same draft of the proposed framework agreement. But important differences are said to remain over what the document will say on future north-south institutions and Dublin's constitutional claim over the province. This is seen in Whitehall as the main trade-off that will be at the core of any agreement. Although London is anxious to encourage Dublin to move further towards rescinding its territorial claim, officials see little point in granting concessions on north-south relations that would be rejected out of hand by unionists. The two sides are also divided on whether the document should simply provide a starting point for new political talks, in line with London's wishes, or set out a specific blueprint for the province's future. Mr Reynolds used a speech in the US yesterday to underline Dublin's readiness to back constitutional changes, provided this was part of 'a balanced constitutional accommodation'. Questioned in Lisburn, where the British army in Northern Ireland is headquartered, Sir Patrick said it was 'not for nothing' that the government asked MPs to renew a provision for internment every year. He said the provision had been retained because the government believed circumstances could be 'envisaged' in which it would be 'necessary to use that power'. Ministers have come under pressure from unionists and Tory backbenchers to intern suspected terrorist ringleaders as part of their response to Saturday's shooting. Government insiders believe such a move is still some way off, however, not least because of the difficulties it could present the Irish government, whose co-operation would be required if the exercise is to be effective.

0,FT934-8393 ,"FT934-8393 _AN-DKPCNACLFT 931116   FT  16 NOV 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Make mine a python - Exporting from the periphery of Europe is not easy. A company that has succeeded      By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY   Eleven years after starting his business in a Northern Ireland farmhouse, Robert Beckett was last week toasting the developed world's taste for cold beer. Beckett's company, Valpar Industrial in Bangor, County Down, had just won the Northern Ireland section of an excellence award sponsored by the Institute of Export, the Financial Times and NatWest Bank. Valpar, which has picked up six business awards since 1989, has succeeded in spite of its size and the logistical handicap of being on the periphery of Europe. It has done so by, among other things, developing a clever product in a niche market, appreciating the importance of quality, investing heavily in research and bringing in outside help to enhance its strategic thinking. Valpar, which has 43 employees, now exports 60 per cent of its Pounds 3m-a-year turnover and claims a 50 per cent share of the domestic UK market. 'This proves you don't have to be a giant to do things right,' says Ian Campbell, director-general of the Institute of Export and one of the judges. 'We were looking for excellence. Valpar demonstrated it in efficiency, quality, education, innovation and in ensuring that exporting was a general direction of the company, not just a bolted-on function.' Valpar makes a product known in the trade as python - a prefabricated line cooling system for dispensing drinks which looks like a thick snake and is similarly flexible. It consists of several plastic tubes - which carry beer, or any other type of beverage, from storeroom to tap - bundled round two inner tubes through which a coolant flows to keep the beverages in the surrounding tubes cool. The whole bundle is encased in insulating foam, forming a thick, black, cable. Beckett's innovation, which he patented, was to automate the bundling and insulating process. Others, such as the brewers themselves, still make python by hand. Beckett has offered them an outsourced solution to a troublesome, labour-intensive problem. His own problem in marketing it, meanwhile, was that of a small business selling to big business in the food industry. Credibility was all, particularly over quality, so Valpar dispelled any doubts by becoming accredited as soon as it could under BS5750, the UK quality standard, and ISO9002, its international equivalent, in 1989. Siobhan McAleer, an international business studies graduate of the University of Ulster who did a project for Valpar and is now business development manager, says this is now paying dividends in export markets because quality can be taken for granted. An impressive list of customers also helps. It includes most of the UK's leading brewers, as well as continental giants such as Heineken. Northern Ireland's relative remoteness has not proved to be a disadvantage. The company was used to long-haul delivery to UK domestic markets; shipping farther afield was not much more difficult. In the US, Valpar's production is licensed to the supplier of python to all McDonald's restaurants, where Coca Cola is the main beverage carried. The chilled Coke dispensed by Moscow McDonald's flows through python made in Northern Ireland. So do all the chilled drinks at Euro Disney. Another secret has been Valpar's decision to opt for a vertically integrated structure, so that, for example, it manufactures its own plastic pipes. This enabled the company to win German health and safety approvals for its python, helping it to sell into Europe's biggest beer market. Beckett believes in sharing some of the company's profits - normally above 10 per cent of sales - with his employees. Performance-related pay accounts for up to a quarter of senior managers' earnings. But most of the remainder is ploughed back into the business, notably into research. Valpar sponsors several postgraduate research students at Queen's University, Belfast or the University of Ulster with a view to improving its products. It is currently developing a nylon-based pipe that will be almost self-cleaning, saving downtime. It is also diversifying into fuel lines for the automotive industry, as well as pythons down which telecommunications companies can propel optical fibres using compressed air. This means cheap python can be installed anywhere, with expensive optical fibre blown down it only when the customer wants it. Not everything has gone smoothly, but when trouble hit, Beckett wisely sought outside advice. 'Three years ago I was not enjoying things as I had before,' he says. 'I brought in consultants to interview all the staff and was forced to conclude that the problem was me. I was starting to get a bit dictatorial.' He decided he needed someone to keep him in check and help the company stay focused. KPMG Peat Marwick, his accountant, helped in headhunting Peter McKie, the Northern Ireland-based managing director of Du Pont UK, who became non-executive chairman in 1991. Simultaneously, Beckett started five-year corporate planning under the guidance of KPMG and Ledu, the Local Enterprise Development Unit which runs Northern Ireland's small business support services. At 38, and with most of Valpar's workforce under 30, he says he still has a long way to go. The question, as with any successful young entrepreneur, is where. If Valpar is not a candidate for flotation, it must surely risk becoming a target for predators. 'I don't want to sell,' Beckett says. 'We are a tightly-knit team and I couldn't do it to the people who have built this company with me.' He thinks diversification into telecommunications and automotive markets offers the best means of both development and defence.   Companies:-  Valpar Industrial.

In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, President Bill Clinton said the US would act as quickly as it could, within the framework of the UN-ordered embargo, to restore water and power to Haiti. Leaders scheduled to address the session included Mr Boris Yeltsin of Russia, who was reported to have brought a new nuclear disarmament proposal with him to the UN. Mr Clinton said the US had 'no desire to be the world's policeman, but we will do what we can to help civil societies emerge from repression'. Acknowledging reluctance both in the US and elsewhere to get involved in the world's trouble spots, Mr Clinton said that nevertheless great progress had been made towards peace in areas such as South Africa, the Middle East and Northern Ireland. Speaking as Mr Gerry Adams, the leader of Sinn Fein, continued his speaking tour of the US, Mr Clinton claimed some of the credit for advancing the 'earnest search by the people of Northern Ireland and Great Britain and Ireland to end centuries of division and decades of terror'. The UN Security Council resolution which imposed general sanctions on Haiti does not provide for their removal until General Raoul Cedras and the military leaders who ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in 1991 have left power. That may not be until October 15, under the terms of the agreement that averted an invasion but led to the current military occupation by the US. But Mr Clinton urged other countries to follow in lifting unilateral measures such as a ban on air travel. In Haiti, he said, a combination of creative diplomacy, the influence of economic power and the credible threat of military force had brought success. But Haiti's people must show patience and restraint to make the transition to a peaceful democracy. 'They have to do this for themselves,' he said. Mr Clinton warned that the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo 'once again faces the prospect of strangulation' by Bosnian Serbs and that the UN would have to show a 'new resolve' to enforce resolutions to protect the city. 'UN actions in Bosnia, as those in Haiti, demonstrate that progress can be made when a coalition backs up diplomacy with military power.' He also announced US support for a new multilateral agreement to control the sale and use of anti-personnel landmines, and called for the eventual elimination of the 85m such weapons which are now believed to be scattered in 62 countries. The US will propose that countries reduce the proportion of landmines in their stockpiles that do not self-destruct or deactivate themselves, and ban exports of mines to countries which have not signed the convention on conventional weapons.

Today he is a  student leader pursuing an English degree at Dublin's Trinity College.    He wrote apologies to his maimed and mutilated victims, renounced violence and,  after 15 years in jail, came out to start a new life.    O'Doherty, now a frenetically energetic 34-year-old eagerly making up for lost  time, joined the Irish Republican Army as an idealistic teen-ager.    Swept away by a romantic idea of a guerrilla group manning the barricades to  protect Northern Ireland's Catholic minority, he was steeped in the bloody  history of Irish independence.    The impressionable son of a middle-class Catholic schoolteacher in Londonderry,  he left a letter for posterity under the floorboards of his room, pledging to  be an IRA martyr ready to die for Ireland.    ""I look back now with horror. I am now very wary of extreme chauvinism and  patriotism,"" he said, his disillusionment with that cause total.    ""I am totally opposed to all violence,"" he said in an interview in Trinity's  basement coffee room. ""It horrifies me to look back at all those shattered  bodies.""    After studying English in prison, he was accepted by Trinity, which was founded  in Dublin in 1591.

0,FT944-9139 ,"FT944-9139 _AN-EKQEIAAGFT 941117   FT  17 NOV 94 / Dublin coalition set to collapse: Spring's resignation as deputy leader may force Irish poll      By JOHN MURRAY BROWN      DUBLIN   The collapse of Ireland's coalition government seemed inevitable last night as Mr Dick Spring, the Labour leader, announced his resignation as deputy prime minister. He said the other five Labour party ministers would also quit the Fianna Fail-led government after he accused Mr Albert Reynolds, the prime minister, of misleading the Dail, the Irish parliament, about the handling of a child sex abuse case. A government confidence motion expected in the Dail this morning is now likely to be defeated. The political uncertainty, amid speculation that the country could be forced to an early elections, has cast a deep shadow over progress on the Northern Ireland peace process. With a possible delay in forming a new administration, officials last night acknowledged the negotiations between London and Dublin on the framework document for a durable constitution would be put on hold. There was even the possibility that the crisis in Dublin could cause London to delay its undertaking to bring Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, into exploratory talks by Christmas. It almost certainly means the forced rescheduling of next week's planned Anglo-Irish conference on the peace process. Mr Spring's decision came at the end of a day of high political drama in which Mr Reynolds, in a last-ditch act of political contrition aimed at regaining Labour support, had admitted a mistake in appointing Mr Harry Whelehan, the attorney-general, as president of the High Court. Mr Whelehan has been under fire for his department's failure to act for seven months on a request from Northern Ireland to extradite a priest later convicted of child sex abuse by a Belfast court. Mr Reynolds last night seemed certain to go to President Mary Robinson to seek an early dissolution of parliament and an early general election. However, there was speculation that the president would use her powers under the constitution to force the parties to create a new coalition within the existing parliament. One factor is likely to be a wish to do as little damage to the peace process as possible. Some elements within Fianna Fail were last night pressing for Mr Reynolds to be replaced as leader ahead of the confidence vote, on the grounds that a change might avert defeat. The favourite to replace Mr Reynolds under those circumstances would be Mr Bertie Ahern, the finance minister. Dublin was in a sombre mood yesterday after Mr Reynolds had struggled to save his political career. In a 45-minute address to the Dail, Mr Reynolds offered what he called the 'full facts, the unvarnished facts' on the extradition case. He said he had acted unwisely in the appointment of Mr Whelehan. After three adjournments the Dail was in its fourth sitting when Mr Reynolds conceded his error in the appointment and said he was unware he had been given misleading information when he made a statement on Tuesday about the sex abuse case. But Mr Spring said that the new evidence had been in the prime minister's possession.

The case alleges that the European Commission broke its own rules by approving the aid earlier this year. European manufacturers argue the Pounds 157m plant will add to capacity and threaten jobs in an already over supplied sector. The Northern Ireland Industrial Development Board, which is responsible for the project, said last night that it could not comment until the court had formed a view on the case. Hualon was unavailable for comment at its headquarters in Taipei. Hualon has recently reaffirmed its commitment to the proposed plant, which it says will create 1,800 jobs in Belfast. However, the filing of the case raises further uncertainties about the project. The start of the project has already been delayed several months to allow time for appeals to the Commission's decision. It is unclear whether Hualon will wish to proceed until the court rules, which is not expected for at least 18 months. The IDB said yesterday building work on the proposed plant had yet to begin, and it had disbursed none of the grant to Hualon. The European Court case has been brought by Aiuffas, an organisation of European filament weaving companies, and the Apparel, Knitting and Textiles Alliance, the lobbying arm of the British Textiles and Apparel Confederation.

0,FT941-6878 ,"FT941-6878 _AN-EB1DPABEFT 940228   FT  28 FEB 94 / Defiant double act shows a softer side: A look at Sinn Fein's mood at its conference      By TIM COONE and MICHAEL CASSELL   The overtly uncompromising stance to emerge at Sinn Fein's party conference, held in a cramped community centre outside Dublin at the weekend, will not be an immediate source of encouragement to the British and Irish governments. Any lingering hopes that the political wing of the IRA would hail the Downing Street declaration as the key to ending violence in Northern Ireland were quickly dashed. Sinn Fein, as expected, decided neither to reject nor to approve the declaration and instead insisted that the UK government reopen direct talks to 'clarify' what it considers the key issues of self-determination and the 'unionist veto'. In a defiant double-act, Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, and Mr Martin McGuinness, a member of the party's national executive, made an elaborate display of unity following suggestions that the leadership was divided on the way ahead. Mr McGuinness won one of the weekend's biggest ovations when he insisted from the platform: 'There is not the slightest possibility of a split.' Both men repeatedly attacked the British government for breaking off its secret talks with Sinn Fein and dismissed threats of a security crackdown if the party rejected the joint declaration. Mr McGuinness, to cheers and applause from a packed hall of delegates, said: 'What are they going to do? Are they going to murder us? We've had that. Are they going to intern us? We've had that . . . we are not afraid of it.' Mr Adams described the UK government's attitude as 'despicable, devious and damnable . . . marked by diversions, lies and petty manoeuvrings'. So much for republican barnstorming. But behind this hard-line rhetoric seemingly designed to reassure the party hardliners that Ireland's reunification remains the goal, there are clear signs that Sinn Fein and the IRA are willing to explore further the Downing Street declaration and to keep the momentum of the peace process going. The central concern of Sinn Fein is the 'unionist veto', by which it means the joint declaration's guarantee to uphold the wish of the majority in Northern Ireland to any constitutional change. Sinn Fein's demand for direct talks with the British government is to clarify whether unionists would be allowed to refuse to reach any agreement at round-table talks, following an IRA ceasefire, and that any political progress towards new constitutional arrangements would then stagnate. Mr Adams, highlighting this concern in his speech, said: 'Is it unreasonable to ask the British government what process, timeframe and framework it proposes for reaching such agreement? Is it unreasonable to ask in advance what would be its reaction if any section of the people who inhabit our island refused to seek such agreement?' Mr McGuinness says Sinn Fein has been assured by Dublin that the British government appears happy with the Irish government's view that the unionists would not have a veto over reaching an agreement. If this could be cleared up in direct talks with the British government, he says, the impasse could be broken and an IRA ceasefire could follow. He is encouraged by recent speeches made by British ministers which he said showed the UK government was 'grappling with new realities'. He added: 'On the one hand they show a hard and stern face, and on the other there are clear signs that many of them are troubled by Britain's role in Ireland.' Sinn Fein's own 'hard and stern face' is similarly showing signs of softening. Mr McGuinness said: 'We must also grapple with new realities. We need to talk to the British government about this and how we can do that.' In a frank admission, Mr Adams acknowledged that Sinn Fein was 'the weaker party in the conflict' and that to move forward it needed to work together with the Irish government and other nationalist parties 'even though we are rivals'. As all these insist on an end to the IRA violence, implicit in Mr Adams' statement is a possible growing realisation that the nationalist goal may now be better served through purely political means rather than military ones. Strengthening the nationalist cause, he said, 'means local republican activists being able to represent and speak for our communities in conditions of peace, uninterfered with by the British military or the RUC, free of personal harassment and free from the threat of the death squads'. At the end of the conference Mr Joe Cahill, a republican veteran, said that Sinn Fein's rallying cry of 'Our day will come' was now obsolete. Now it was 'Our day is here'. But the reality is that Sinn Fein, buoyed up by its recent centre-stage performance, is threatened with a return to the shadows unless it is prepared to take further risks. A weekend opinion poll showed that, in spite of huge efforts to win publicity for its cause, public support remains minimal. As Mr Adams admitted, the next step in Northern Ireland is far from certain. In words even British ministers might support he suggested the situation was of such potential political fluidity that 'not us, the British or Dublin governments can accurately predict the outcome'.

Now it is time to revert to more orthodox methods. With hopes of an early IRA response to the Downing Street declaration fading fast, London has been trying to inject momentum into the three-year-old talks process with Ulster's non-violent political parties. It badly needs a success to prevent the impetus behind the drive for a lasting settlement for the province from draining away. There are also hopes that progress in the political talks might yet be the lever that eventually persuades republican leaders to ditch the armed struggle and embrace the process. As Dr John Alderdice, leader of the non-sectarian Alliance party, puts it: 'As Sinn Fein sees the train drawing out of the station, they may be prepared to jump on board.' Yet a series of Financial Times interviews in recent days with the leaders of the four main constitutional parties indicates that many serious obstacles still stand in the way of a positive outcome. The leaders' comments, in brief, point to a long and tortuous process with success far from assured. The words with which the Rev Ian Paisley greeted the announcement by the then Northern Ireland secretary Mr Peter Brooke in March 1991 that a basis for formal political talks existed still seem apposite. 'The gate into the field has been opened,' the leader of the hardline Democratic Unionist party said at the time. 'But . . . there is a lot of hard ploughing in front of us.' The main problem areas appear to be as follows: The 'nothing is agreed until everything is agreed' formula. This, by definition, precludes the possibility of gradual progress. Every syllable and punctuation mark has to be agreed before anything can be set in stone. Mr John Hume, leader of the mainly Roman Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party, regards the principle as 'crucially important'. It ensures the talks address all the relationships - within Northern Ireland, between north and south, and between the two governments, he says. An agreement confined to the question of 'who wields power in Northern Ireland' would not necessarily solve the province's problems, Mr Hume believes. Unionists favour a less ambitious framework paving the way for a return to devolved government in Ulster, independent of what might be agreed in the other two 'strands' of the talks process. They point out that a blueprint for an Ulster assembly was drawn up by a working party comprising all four constitutional parties during the talks initiated by Mr Brooke. Mr Paisley says openly that, as far as he is concerned, the formula no longer applies. It was exposed as a 'fallacy' during the 'failed' Brooke talks process, he says. How to handle the relationship between the north and Dublin. There is no disguising the fundamental differences between the participants on this second strand of the talks process. An Ulster Unionist party document to be published this month will argue that the relationship should be handled by ad hoc meetings between Irish ministers and Ulster assembly representatives. But proposals implying that no separate north-south institution - such as a dedicated secretariat - is necessary would probably be anathema to the SDLP and to Dublin. Mr James Molyneaux, the UUP leader, goes so far as to say: 'Not only are the institutionalised bits unnecessary, but they are unconstitutional. 'They would tend to tie elected representatives from one part of the United Kingdom into bargains/arrangements/undertakings without our sovereign government being aware of it,' he says. The DUP's boycott of the talks. Not only is Sinn Fein excluded from the talks process. So at present is the DUP. While this could make agreement between those who are participating less difficult to achieve, it might also undermine its effectiveness. As Mr Michael Ancram, the Northern Ireland minister, said yesterday: 'A political settlement that brings peace is one that has to have widespread acceptance.' The current DUP line is that it will not return to the talks until London explicitly rules out any possibility of a united Ireland. According to one senior DUP official, London would have to 'embark on a new security policy that demonstrates the British are here to stay, irrespective of consent'. The reluctance of some participants to move from bilateral discussions back to a round-table format. After the experience of the Brooke talks, some are wary of returning to what they see as the 'goldfish-bowl' of round-table discussions. There is though a general recognition that the current time-consuming bilateral structure cannot continue indefinitely. Mr Molyneaux favours 'a fair amount of commonality' being established before participants go back to sitting around a table. The two governments' apparent inability to prevent a continuation of terrorism. It is in Mr Hume's words 'quite obvious' that the talks process's prospects of success would be improved immeasurably if they took place 'in an atmosphere of total peace'. That is why the SDLP leader says he has pleaded for patience in awaiting Sinn Fein's response to the joint declaration. Continuing terrorist killings can only exacerbate tensions. But can a cessation of violence be delivered even in the event of an end to the IRA's 25-year campaign? Mr Paisley, for one, is pessimistic.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

The survey, produced by the Confederation of British Industry and Business Strategies, a regional economic consultancy, showed that differences in demand have produced mixed fortunes for manufacturing across different regions. Overall, UK manufacturing orders and output changed little in the four months to October. But orders for companies in the west Midlands and Scotland increased sharply while in Northern Ireland and the south-west they fell. A mixed demand pattern is forecast for the four months from October, with strong order growth expected in the north-west and Wales against forecasts of falling orders in the east Midlands and Yorkshire and Humberside. Although Scottish industry expects to increase staff slightly in the coming months, manufacturing employment is expected to fall in all regions in the present quarter compared with a year ago. Recession in continental Europe has dampened confidence, especially about export prospects. Just four regions - Scotland, Northern Ireland, the west Midlands and East Anglia - recorded substantial increases in business confidence. Only in Scotland and Wales were manufacturers more optimistic about export prospects over the coming year than they had been in the last CBI-BSL survey in July. Most UK regions reported falling export optimism with declines especially pronounced in the south-west, the north and the east Midlands. Export orders declined during the past four months in all regions except Wales and Scotland. The survey, carried out in the first half of last month, shows that output rose appreciably in six UK regions, with especially strong growth in the west Midlands, Wales and East Anglia. All regions except Northern Ireland and Yorkshire and Humberside expect increased production in the four months from October, with the west Midlands expecting the most robust growth. Mr Andrew Sentance, the CBI's economic director, said the buoyancy in the west Midlands could reflect increased demand for motor components and the effect on output and orders of the temporary acceleration of investment allowances that expired last month. Scotland is also performing well. According to Mr Charles Burton, BSL joint managing director, Scotland could be benefiting from increased demand for electronic products and relatively low levels of household and corporate debt. The rundown in the coal industry and recession on the Continent have probably contributed to less favourable trends in Yorkshire and Humberside.

As terrorist experts investigated the cause of the fires  which broke out at seven stores in central London this morning,  Mr Reynolds again stressed there was still no deadline for an  IRA response to December's joint initiative.    The Dublin premier was speaking before new talks at Downing  Street with John Major on prospects for ending the terrorism --  against a background of the Oxford Street firebombings at the  end of last month and renewed IRA violence earlier this week.    The new IRA attacks -- including the first murder this year  -- were being seen as a thumbs-down for the talks process.    But Mr Reynolds said: ""If somebody thinks I'll just give up  because we have another unfortunate killing or attacks, they  should know it is not going to stop me.    ""We are on a mission of peace and will continue with it  until  we are absolutely satisfied there is no hope left. That is the  way I feel at the moment -- and I am going to continue on that  road.""    Mr Reynolds arrived in London last night with Deputy Premier  and Foreign Minister Dick Spring for their first meeting with Mr  Major and Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew since  the December 15 signing of the Ulster declaration.    Early indications were that this morning's store attacks  were  carried out by the IRA. The outbreaks were caused by incendiary  devices which bore ""all the hallmarks of the Provisional IRA"",  said Scotland Yard.    But the Irish team made clear they were more determined than  ever to keep alive the prospects for peace.    As Mr Reynolds consulted officials before heading for  Downing  Street, he agreed the renewed terrorism -- demonstrated by both  the IRA and loyalist paramilitaries in Belfast this week -- was  ""disappointing"".    He asserted, however: ""I am still very hopeful of the  chances  for peace. There has been considerable progress already as I  see it. I have said from the very start that I did not believe  there would be a quick decision on the part of the republican  movement.    ""Their decision is of historic proportions, and it will  inevitably take time. There is an intense debate going on in  Ireland north and south among the republicans.""    Mr Reynolds said he thought there was considerable support  from members of the IRA and Sinn Fein for the peace declaration  in the run-up to their annual conference in Dublin next weekend.    ""I have no intention of setting a deadline. That is not the  way we are going to get a result at the end of the day,"" he  added, basing his assessment on contacts he has had with  community leaders on both sides of the Ulster border.    After their talks, Mr Major and Mr Reynolds will join the  crowd at the England-Ireland rugby international at Twickenham.    Later, in what sounded like a direct message to Sinn Fein,  Mr  Reynolds said there was sufficient in the explanations and  clarifications of the Downing Street Declaration ""to enable the  debate to come to a conclusion"".    Considerable progress had been made towards peace since the  publication of the declaration in mid-December, he told BBC  Radio 4's Today programme shortly before his Downing Street  talks.    ""I have said from the start I did not believe there would be  any quick decision in this regard. I think the intense debate  that is continuing in the republican movement is what I expected  it to be -- very intense. For them to come to a decision of  historic proportions will inevitably take time.""    While he thought there was growing support among  nationalists  for peace ""a slim majority would not really be acceptable among  the republican movement.    ""Nobody wants a split in that movement again -- the split in  the 1970's brought the last 25 years of violence and we do not  want another 25 years of violence.    ""Whatever time it takes to finish that debate and to ensure  a  very large majority of republican supporters would go along with  the peace process -- that is what we want and that is what we  are going to try to achieve.""

If the reports are true they could have a bearing on the timing of talks between British government officials and Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, on how Sinn Fein might enter peace negotiations. However, the RUC said: 'We have only had one anonymous phone call saying he saw someone with a gun. Several people said they saw masked men.

0,FT922-13358 ,"FT922-13358 _AN-CDKAKAEYFT 920411   FT  11 APR 92 / Election 1992: Sinn Fein loses Belfast West after tactical vote      By TIM COONE   SINN FEIN, the political wing of the Provisional IRA, yesterday lost its Belfast West seat after the extremist loyalist Ulster Defence Association advised the strongly Protestant Shankill area to vote tactically for a moderate nationalist candidate. The defeat of Mr Gerry Adams, who had never taken up the Commons seat he won in 1987, by local GP Mr Joe Hendron of the Social Democratic and Labour party, brought diverse reactions ranging from claims of an SDLP 'breakthrough' to a warning that military actions by the IRA could be stepped up. Mr Adams maintained his vote in the constituency at over 16,800, and Mr Hendron appears to have won largely as a result of tactical voting by Unionist supporters. Unionist leaders urged the minority Protestant community in Belfast West to vote for the Ulster Unionist party, but the UDA, which has a strong presence in the Shankill area, recommended a tactical vote in favour of the SDLP. The UDA put out a leaflet on the Shankill Road which said a vote for the UUP was 'a vote for Sinn Fein'. The UUP vote in the constituency fell 37 per cent to 4,766 from 7,646 in 1987, while the SDLP jumped to 17,415 from 14,641, giving it a slim 600 majority over Sinn Fein. Mr Hendron described the result as 'a rejection of violence, of all paramilitary groups'. Mr Seamus Mallon, deputy leader of the SDLP, said it was the 'real breakthrough' the party had been looking for in its effort to deprive the IRA of its political base in Northern Ireland. Mr Peter Robinson, deputy leader of the Democratic Unionist party, warned: 'There are still 17,000 Provo supporters in west Belfast who may now be about to put both hands on the Armalite. The security forces must be on the alert for an upsurge in violence now that (Mr Adams) has lost his political card.' Mr Adams described his defeat as 'a temporary setback' and Sinn Fein officials pointed out that their vote had largely held firm throughout the province. Mr Jonathan Stephenson, a spokesman for the SDLP, warned: 'It would be wrong to claim that a major shift to the SDLP has started.' He said the real test would be in next year's local elections. 'Sinn Fein has had a good group of community politicians in west Belfast who have done a lot of work on the ground,' he said. A question raised by Mr Adams' defeat is whether it will undermine his recent efforts to forge a separate identity for Sinn Fein from the IRA, or whether the militarists will once again win the upper hand. The UUP and DUP have meanwhile seen their overall share of the Northern Ireland vote slip by about 2 percentage points, adding to the loss of 2.3 points in 1987. The DUP and UUP put up competing candidates in three constituencies, where a split Unionist vote would not let in a nationalist candidate. In South Down, where the SDLP was defending a narrow 731 majority against a UUP challenge, a recount was needed. Mr Ian Paisley, the DUP leader, characteristically began his victory speech on being returned to his seat at North Antrim by singing 'Oh God, from whom all blessings flow'. In a thinly disguised criticism of his UUP challenger he said: 'This constituency needs my voice, my representation and the stand that I take.' The appearance of the Conservatives for the first time in a concerted electoral effort in Northern Ireland made significant inroads into both the Alliance vote and that of the UUP. Dr Laurence Kennedy, the Tory candidate in North Down, said that, in spite of his failure to oust the independent Unionist Mr Jim Kilfedder, 'the Conservative party is now well-established as an electoral force in Northern Ireland'. The Conservatives appear to have won about 7 per cent of the overall vote in the province.  The Financial Times   London Page 8  "

Remarks intended to drive home London and Dublin's determination to maintain the momentum of the peace process may cause consternation among unionists. Mr Reynolds told the Irish parliament that the governments were pressing ahead with drafting a new 'framework document' as the focus for renewed talks in the province 'as and when the parties are ready to resume'. But he emphasised the two governments agreed that 'no party', whether unionist or republican, would be allowed to block progress towards a political solution. Asked if this meant the two governments might 'go over the heads' of the province's parties in their efforts to seek a settlement, Mr Reynolds acknowledged: 'It may well arrive at that situation, although it would be preferable to have the agreement of the parties.' The Northern Ireland Office last night had no comment on Mr Reynold's remarks, although it emphasised that the British government remained adamant there could be no imposed solutions. The entire basis of the Downing Street declaration, they stressed, was the desire to achieve agreement on Ulster's future. Current bilateral talks with the parties would progress on that basis. The Anglo-Irish framework document will seek to flesh out the Downing Street declaration by detailing the new north-south structures and institutions envisaged in the document and, according to Mr Reynolds yesterday, will also try to deal with 'other issues'. Unionist leaders will be concerned that this may signify that Dublin intends to have a say in the framing of new constitutional arrangements for Northern Ireland. Mr Reynolds did not expect the unionists to come to the table before the elections to the European parliament this June, but he hoped that progress could be made during the summer. A 'deep and yawning gap' between the British government and Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, would also 'have eventually to be bridged' he added.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

0,FT941-9593 ,"FT941-9593 _AN-EBNCXAC1FT 940214   FT  14 FEB 94 / UK squandering peace opportunity, says Adams: Hopes fade that IRA will accept declaration      By MICHAEL CASSELL      BELFAST   Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, yesterday accused Britain of 'squandering a unique opportunity for peace', adding to growing government pessimism on the likelihood that the IRA and Sinn Fein will accept the Downing Street declaration. In remarks that dashed expectations of an early decision by the republican movement on accepting the declaration as a basis for peace in Northern Ireland, Mr Adams demanded changes in the British government's position. He said that although Dublin had given some clarification of the declaration, London had 'stalled, delayed and refused' to explain further a document which he described as a 'masterpiece of ambiguity'. He claimed it would be impossible for Sinn Fein to give a definitive response without more information. Both London and Dublin have repeatedly insisted that the IRA must end violence before Sinn Fein can join talks on the future of Northern Ireland. When they meet next weekend, Mr John Major, the prime minister, and Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish premier, will be expected to declare their determination to press on with the broad process of negotiations. Giving no sign of any softening in Sinn Fein's stance, Mr Adams rejected what he described as the unionist veto on constitutional changes in Northern Ireland. He insisted that London would have to join the 'persuaders' in seeking to convince unionists that their future lay 'with the rest of the Irish people'. Interviewed on ITV's Walden programme, in which Mr Adams's statements were read by an actor, he called on ministers to go the extra mile for peace. 'Unless the British government says to the unionists: 'Your future rests with the rest of the Irish people' - unless it makes that small step forward, then that government cannot say it is interested in peace.' He said republicans recognised that they needed the consent and full participation of unionists in the process, but that they did not want the British government 'sitting on its hands and blaming and using the unionists'. Mr Adams added: 'Let us not squander the opportunity for peace on the rock of either a veto or on the British refusing to join the persuaders.' Mr Adams said if the British government believed the joint declaration was a basis for a political settlement, it should be prepared for further discussion. Downing Street said last night the government's position on the declaration remained unchanged. It said it was 'deeds not words' that were important and that all the IRA had to do if it wanted progress in Northern Ireland was to abandon violence.

0,FT941-14768 ,"FT941-14768 _AN-EASC7ABLFT 940119   FT  19 JAN 94 / Those other Ulster talks are on again: How attention is shifting to an internal political settlement      By DAVID OWEN   With the UK-Irish peace initiative stalled, the delicate talks process aimed at securing an internal political settlement in Northern Ireland is poised to re-emerge from the shadows to which it has been consigned since November. The talks, co-ordinated by Mr Michael Ancram, the Northern Ireland minister, and involving Ulster's four main constitutional parties, have inevitably fallen out of the spotlight while it seemed the Downing Street declaration might persuade the IRA to renounce violence. But now that the government has concluded that the odds are against an early end to the 25-year republican campaign - clearing the way for Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, to enter the political process - this order of priorities is about to change. This was signalled last week when Mr Ancram began a new round of bilateral meetings, seeing a delegation from the largest party in the province, the Ulster Unionists. Yesterday he saw senior Alliance party members. Next week he is due to meet the mainly Roman Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party. The message to republican leaders is clear. Their hesitancy over the joint declaration will not be allowed to delay efforts to piece together a political settlement. After yesterday's meeting Dr John Alderdice, leader of the Alliance party, added his voice to those calling for the government not to wait for Sinn Fein. Those familiar with the talks say the focus of the minister's efforts is to pin down an agenda that would permit participants to move on from the current time-consuming bilateral format - disparaged by some as 'blind-date politics' - to round-table discussions. It will not be easy. Ministers have said in the past that a resumption of round-table talks would be counter-productive until agreement is achievable. An earlier round-table talks process broke up without success in 1992. The hardline Democratic Unionist party has said it will not return to the talks process, bilateral or otherwise, until the meetings between Mr John Hume, the SDLP leader, and Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, end. Sinn Fein, as might be expected, is scathing about the exercise's prospects of success. Mr Tom Hartley, the party's national chairman, says: 'I don't think the dynamic for change can be found any more in those sorts of talks.' Mr Ancram is thought to have identified a certain amount of common ground on structures for devolved government in the province, including an 85-member Ulster assembly. But less headway has been made on 'strand two' of the talks  -how to handle relations between the province and the Irish Republic. Ulster Unionists are keen for efforts to be focused on setting this assembly up. But the SDLP is unlikely to consent to this without agreement on north/south relations, and on strand three - relations between the two governments. Mr Hume is said to have received assurances last week that the talks process would continue to embrace all three sets of relationships. But London is still waiting for a paper setting out Dublin's ideas on strands two and three which it requested last September.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

He said: 'I believe (the opportunity) is there, and I want to see (Mr Major) take the courage and conviction in his hands, because we have a moment in history to do it and it may not be there for a long, long time again.' Speaking on BBC TV's On the Record programme, Mr Reynolds said: 'I believe there is an enormous responsibility on us to lead in this situation. We have an opportunity, let's maximise it. History will never forgive us if we don't' In separate radio interviews, Mr Reynolds said: 'I believe that if those crunch issues are addressed in an open and frank manner, with courage and conviction on both sides, it is possible we can see the beginning of peace before Christmas.' Mr Reynolds' attempt to shift the onus on to Mr Major in part reflects the pressures from within his own Fianna Fail party that Dublin should win more open concessions for the nationalist community in the north. Dublin believes that after its recent signals of willingness to meet concerns of Ulster Unionists about the future of Northern Ireland's political system, Mr Major should signal he is prepared to consider nationalist demands over the north. In an apparent divergence with the British government over the aims of the initiative on Northern Ireland that the two prime ministers announced 10 days ago in Brussels, Mr Reynolds insisted the priority should be a cessation of violence. He said a resumption of political talks between the main constitutional parties would not be sufficient. 'If you don't get the people who are carrying out the violence to cease violence, then I don't believe political talks are going to bring an end to violence.' He reiterated that if there were to be a proven end to the IRA military campaign, 'there is a place at the table for Sinn Fein . . . That is the (sequence) of events as I see them that will bring results'. However, Mr Reynolds is having to thread an increasingly delicate path through his own party. At Fianna Fail's annual conference in Dublin at the weekend he faced criticism from delegates for his move to sideline the initiative launched by Mr John Hume, leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party, and Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein. Mr Reynolds responded by praising but not endorsing the contribution to the peace process by Mr Hume, who was last night admitted to hospital suffering 'flu. 'Mr Hume's contribution is essential to any wide-based overall framework for peace. (But) the creation of that peace must ultimately be the responsibility of the Irish and British governments,' he said. The Royal Ulster Constabulary is to investigate the shooting of a woman by a soldier last night near Omagh, County Tyrone. The RUC said the woman, later reported to be 'ill but stable' in hospital, was a passenger in a car. A number of children in the vehicle were treated for cuts and shock.

0,FT932-2181 ,"FT932-2181 _AN-DFTAMAESFT 930619   FT  19 JUN 93 / Property: Big house, low price, the charm of Ireland - Gerald Cadogan finds a wealth of choice in a relaxed environment      By GERALD CADOGAN   GO TO Ireland for a holiday, and you may stay for life. Many Georgian houses still lurk behind estate walls, at prices that are attractive to UK buyers. Although the acres may be fewer than they were 100 years ago, because land has been sold off to pay bills - or the Land Commission has redistributed it  -you should have no difficulty finding a fine property. Perhaps an 18th century house - or an 18th-century-style house built in the 19th century, with stable yard, outbuildings, walled garden, land and fishing may be to your taste. Even with 6 per cent purchase tax, there is more for your money in Ireland - and no domestic rates or council tax. If you like a different pace of life, Ireland has masses to see and do. Although the numbers of British visitors has fallen in recent years, do not be afraid if you are English. The insoluble saga of Northern Ireland has an extremely limited effect on day-to-day life in the republic. The economy looks to be climbing slowly out of recession and, after a traumatic spell in the wake of the British pound's devaluation, the Irish punt has settled at so close to par with the pound that we can show the guide prices with a Pounds sign that holds for both countries. Interest rates are down and, as in Britain, devaluation has given farmers more Green Punts through the EC's payments. Farmland prices are holding up well. The Irish country house market was buoyed during the UK property boom as English buyers saw what good value Ireland offered. With heavy falls in prices during last year and the early part of this, it is even better value. Travel between Heathrow and Dublin has improved with three companies (Aer Lingus, BA and British Midland) competing for travellers, while EC grants are financing new major roads. This makes it feasible to live in Ireland and commute to England for, perhaps, a shortened office week. One might also be able to work from home by fax or modem, and realise a considerable saving compared with buying a similar house in, for example, Hampshire. Knight Frank  Rutley, together with Hamilton Osborne King (HOK), is selling Rathmore Park in Co Carlow by auction on Friday at a disclosed reserve of just Pounds 230,000 for a Georgian house with park, stables and fishing on the Slaney. A higher price will be no surprise. Last week HOK sold the Georgian-style Coolclogher House in Co Kerry at auction at Pounds 420,000, as against an expected Pounds 300,000-Pounds 350,000, attracting domestic and foreign bidders. Auctions are regular in Ireland and do not carry the 'it could not sell privately' stigma - as can happen in the UK. The auction reveals which people are really interested in the property. If it has not sold, they can be approached afterwards for private negotiations. If it does sell, there is the advantage that everybody knows the price. The most expensive house on sale in Ireland is a Georgian stately manor with reception rooms designed by Robert Adam and a remarkable collection of Asian conifers and rhododendrons. Headfort House at Kells in County Meath is a convenient 40 miles from Dublin, with 860 acres including 11 cottages, a shoot and fishing on the Blackwater. This great house is now leased to a prep school. The buyer can move into a wing, but will have to wait five years for the whole of the big house, which Keane Mahony Smith (KMS) offers at Pounds 4m. Much cheaper is Avonmore House near Dublin in Co Wicklow at Pounds 1.75m from HOK. It is a lovely Georgian house with ornate plasterwork and comes with a heated swimming pool and stable yard with 18 boxes. And Pounds 1m secures the Noan estate of 550 acres (again a Georgian house) in Co Tipperary, from KMS in Cork and Jackson-Stops  McCabe. A rare Georgian house near Howth at the north end of Dublin Bay, with a fine windswept, seaside garden and 10 acres in all, is Drumleck which Lisney offers at around Pounds 1.5m. In Co Galway in the west Heaslip is selling Clydagh House at Headford on Lough Corrib, which still has free fishing for salmon and trout. The Georgian house has 146 acres for around Pounds 750,000. Near Mullingar in Co Westmeath and convenient for Dublin is Gigginstown, an 1840s Georgian delight in grey stone and white paint, set in parkland. It is not overwhelming - Robert Ganly, of Ganly Walters, agents with Strutt  Parker calls it 'a grand honest house' - but it does have fine plasterwork and a main staircase that splits into two at the half-landing. The vendor, who is leaving after 58 years there, says she is 'lucky to have been a tenant for life' and looks for a sympathetic buyer. The price is around Pounds 580,000. In the Troubles in the early 1920s big houses of the Anglo-Irish ascendancy were burnt down - a powerful theme in the writings of Molly Keane and William Trevor. I had assumed that they were left as ruins. Wrong. The government gave compensation (as today in Northern Ireland) and some were rebuilt in a 1920s Georgian style embellished with Bauhaus or Art Deco touches. Molly Kean describes one in Loving and Giving. 'As you see, everything straight from Harrods - the Customs must have been enormous.' These large houses tried to assert the old regime. Today, like the huge princely palaces in India built in the 1920s-1940s, their symbolism seems an irony of history. But they are intriguing homes. Ganly Walters and Jordan has recently sold Saunders Grove, at Baltinglass, Co Wicklow, for Pounds 750,000, about 9 per cent below the guide price. Now Gunne offers Milestown at Castlebellingham in Co Louth, north of Dublin on the way to Belfast, a house of solid comfort in tip-top shape with gardens running down to the river Glyde, at more than Pounds 500,000. Ireland has a good supply of large-ish houses in the Pounds 200,000-Pounds 400,000 range, as the agents will be happy to tell you. One, Weir House, which is splendidly placed on Woodstown Beach with views over Waterford Harbour, is offered by JSM and Palmer Rohan for more than Pounds 200,000. Some are glebe houses, the Irish term for old rectories of the (Anglican) Church of Ireland (not of the Roman Catholics) as at Moyglare outside Maynooth in Co Kildare, on sale for around Pounds 400,000 from JSM with Coonan. Castles are also integral to Irish life, reflecting the endless troubles the island has suffered. Mount Nugent in Co Cavan is a restored 16th century tower house (keep) offered by JSM and Armstrong at over Pounds 200,000, with 17 acres, two cottages and a jetty on Lough Sheelin. Priced at Pounds 700,000 is the romantic-looking Cloghan Castle in Co Offaly with duck shooting on the nearby Shannon, from JSM. Two other fairytale castles are the firm's Strancally Castle (1820s built by the Pain brothers) in Co Waterford (Pounds 800,000-Pounds 850,000), and Dromore in Co Kerry, with fishing on the Blackwater and netting in the Kenmare. HOK and Cheveley Johnston suggest a price around Pounds 400,000. The Mill House on the River Slaney at Clonegal, Bunclody in Co Wexford is an idyll. Water races through the rapids outside the 18th century woollen mill and still turns the wheel. I sat in the picture window of the old weaving loft and watched the river. Sitting longer, I should have seen kingfishers and herons, and last week a pair of otters played on the other bank. The grounds are wooded and rocky with rare azaleas and rhododendrons. The only noise is the river. Ganly Walters, Strutt  Parker and JSM offer this paradise at Pounds 325,000. Further information.

0,FT921-8326 ,"FT921-8326 _AN-CBRBMAD2FT 920218   FT  18 FEB 92 / Dublin 'concern' on IRA deaths      By Our Belfast Correspondent and DAVID BUCHAN      LISBON   ONE OF the four IRA men shot dead by the Army minutes after an attack on a Northern Ireland police station had been cleared at a London court last year of gun-running charges, it emerged yesterday. Kevin O'Donnell, 21, was arrested in London in May 1990. He later told an Old Bailey jury that he had no knowledge of weapons found in his car and was subsequently acquitted. The Dublin government yesterday expressed concern about the shootings, as Mr David Andrews, the Irish foreign minister, predicted an early meeting between Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, and Mr Albert Reynolds, the new Irish premier. An armed IRA gang attacked the Royal Ulster Constabulary's Coalisland station at about 10.35pm on Sunday. Minutes later there was an exchange of gunfire near the town. The RUC said: 'Soldiers in uniform encountered a number of vehicles and armed men at Dernagh crossroads, at a car park, at St Patrick's Roman Catholic church. There was an exchange of gunfire. Four men were killed, two were wounded and are in hospital under police guard. A soldier was wounded and is in hospital.' 'A heavy 12.7mm machine-gun, mounted on a hijacked lorry, was recovered at the scene along with several AK47 rifles,' the RUC added. All those killed are understood to have been members of the IRA's East Tyrone 'brigade'. The unit has lost several members in confrontations with the security forces, including eight who were shot dead at Loughall, South Armagh, nearly five years ago. It is believed that soldiers had been monitoring the 'brigade' for several weeks. The Rev William McCrae, Democratic Unionist MP for Mid-Ulster, supported the 'effective engagement' of terrorists, saying it would save lives. 'I trust this is the commencement of a vigorous and determined security initiative.' Mr Francie Molloy, a Sinn Fein councillor, alleged that the deaths arose from a 'deliberate shoot-to-kill policy' by the Army. Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, yesterday assured Mr Andrews that the government would continue to treat Northern Ireland as a priority problem. At a meeting of EC foreign ministers in Lisbon Mr Hurd told his Irish counterpart that Mr Major would continue his involvement in all-party talks on the province. Police yesterday discovered a suspected IRA underground arms bunker in the Irish Republic. About 1,000 rounds of ammunition and five magazines were found in a bunker beneath a cowshed on a farm near the town of Abbeyfeale, on the border of County Kerry and County Limerick. A 17-year-old Protestant man was shot dead last night when a gunman opened fire inside a video club in north Belfast. The attack happened in the Upper Crumlin Road district. The shot man was a member of staff in the video club.

The talks, co-ordinated by Mr Michael Ancram, the Northern  Ireland minister, and involving Ulster's four main  constitutional parties, have inevitably fallen out of the  spotlight while it seemed the Downing Street declaration might  persuade the IRA to renounce violence.    But now that the government has concluded that the odds are  against an early end to the 25-year republican campaign --  clearing the way for Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, to  enter the political process -- this order of priorities is about  to change.    This was signalled last week when Mr Ancram began a new  round  of bilateral meetings, seeing a delegation from the largest  party in the province, the Ulster Unionists.    Yesterday he saw senior Alliance party members. Next week he  is due to meet the mainly Roman Catholic Social Democratic and  Labour party [SDLP].    The message to republican leaders is clear. Their hesitancy  over the joint declaration will not be allowed to delay efforts  to piece together a political settlement. After yesterday's  meeting Dr John Alderdice, leader of the Alliance party, added  his voice to those calling for the government not to wait for  Sinn Fein.    Those familiar with the talks say the focus of the  minister's  efforts is to pin down an agenda that would permit participants  to move on from the current time-consuming bilateral format --  disparaged by some as ""blind-date politics"" to round-table  discussions.    It will not be easy. Ministers have said in the past that a  resumption of round-table talks would be counter-productive  until agreement is achievable. An earlier round-table talks  process broke up without success in 1992.    The hardline Democratic Unionist Party has said it will not  return to the talks process, bilateral or otherwise, until the  meetings between Mr John Hume, the SDLP leader, and Mr Gerry  Adams, the Sinn Fein president, end.    Sinn Fein, as might be expected, is scathing about the  exercise's prospects of success. Mr Tom Hartley, the party's  national chairman, says: ""I don't think the dynamic for change  can be found any more in those sorts of talks.""    Mr Ancram is thought to have identified a certain amount of  common ground on structures for devolved government in the  province, including an 85-member Ulster assembly. But less  headway has been made on ""strand two"" of the talks -- how to  handle relations between the province and the Irish Republic.    Ulster Unionists are keen for efforts to be focused on  setting this assembly up. But the SDLP is unlikely to consent  to this without agreement on north/south relations, and on  strand three -- relations between the two governments.    Mr Hume is said to have received assurances last week that  the talks process would continue to embrace all three sets of  relationships. But London is still waiting for a paper setting  out Dublin's ideas on strands two and three which it requested  last September.     "

0,FT934-12716 ,"FT934-12716 _AN-DJZDHAAGFT 931026   FT  26 OCT 93 / Major rules out deal with IRA on ceasefire: Adams banned from entering Britain - Mayhew condemns 'sickening hypocrisy'      By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor   THE British government angrily rejected last night a proposal from Mr Gerry Adams for a conditional IRA ceasefire and announced the Sinn Fein leader had been banned from entering Great Britain. It accused Mr Adams of 'sickening hypocrisy' and set an unconditional and permanent end to violence as a precondition for the IRA and its supporters to be brought into any negotiations on the future of Ulster. The message was reinforced by the announcement that Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, had signed an indefinite exclusion order under the Prevention of Terrorism Act. The order - signed before the latest IRA bombing in Belfast - prevents the Sinn Fein leader from travelling from Ulster to any other part of the UK. As the weekend killing of Protestant civilians in Belfast's Shankill Road was followed by a bomb attack on a mainland railway line, Mr John Major came close to dismissing the initiative drawn up with Mr Adams by Mr John Hume, leader of the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour Party. But the government was careful not to extend its denunciation to Mr Hume's role in preparing the proposals. Last night Protestant terrorists claimed responsibility for the murder of a Catholic in North Belfast. Earlier a Catholic taxi-driver died in hospital after a revenge shooting in response to the Shankill Road bombing. Mr Adams told the BBC a positive response from the London government to the Hume-Adams proposals could bring an IRA ceasefire. But at the Commonwealth summit in Cyprus, Mr Major retorted: 'I am not going to do deals with people who plant bombs and kill innocent people.' That view was echoed in the House of Commons by Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland Secretary, as the latest IRA attacks brought universal condemnation from government and opposition MPs. In a sombre denunciation of the Belfast bombing - which killed nine Protestant civilians as well as one of the terrorists - Sir Patrick said: 'Next to the sickening quality of what was done to people in the Shankill on Saturday has been the sickening quality of the hypocrisy of Mr Adams.' The condition for dialogue with Sinn Fein and the IRA was an end to violence 'without condition and forever'. The Northern Ireland secretary, however, 'saluted' Mr Hume for his courage in seeking a settlement. Senior ministers said they saw no real prospect of the Hume-Adams proposals' leading to a lasting settlement, but could not afford to reject them out of hand before they had been formally presented by Dublin. Mr Hume said the British government could not afford to reject a set of proposals which had as their objective a 'lasting peace and total cessation of violence'. But Mr Major underlined the gulf between the two sides by accusing Mr Adams of blackmail: 'If Mr Adams can end the violence then he should end the violence now without preconditions, without any delay . . . and without any proposals which sound to me tantamount to blackmail.' Sir Patrick's Commons statement was quickly followed by the announcement of the exclusion order against Mr Adams. The announcement from Mr Howard - who signed the order last Tuesday - said that Mr Adams was or is concerned in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism connected with Northern Ireland. The decision came after reports that the Sinn Fein leader was planning to visit Great Britain at the invitation of Mr Tony Benn, the Labour MP. The rail network in southern England was in chaos after the IRA detonated a bomb on the main line from London to the west of England. Two bombs were placed in Reading, one of which exploded several hours after the first had been successfully defused. Police said the second blast had been calculated to kill workers from the emergency services responding to a coded warning of the first attack.

0,FT944-12074 ,"FT944-12074 _AN-EKCEGACFFT 941103   FT  03 NOV 94 / Questions remain over Pounds 61m Hualon grant      By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Business Editor   Ever since the Northern Ireland Industrial Development Board made a Pounds 61m grant to Hualon of Taiwan to build a Belfast textiles plant, it has been coy about publishing details of the controversial project. According to Mrs Jennifer d'Abo, who resigned as an outside director of the board yesterday in protest at the deal, the development board's own executives have been almost as parsimonious in supplying hard facts to the directors to whom they are supposedly accountable. 'I have scrabbled for information. I have spent a great deal of time trying to get answers. I resigned because I cannot get to the bottom of this thing,' she said yesterday. 'We cannot commit Pounds 61m of taxpayers' money to something as nebulous as this.' Mrs d'Abo, who made a fortune in the 1980s by turning around the Rymans stationery chain and selling it for Pounds 20m to Pentos, the bookshops group, said she had queried the Hualon project since it first went to the IDB board in September 1992. Her suspicions were aroused by the fact that Mr Oung Ta-ming, Hualon's effective head, and his brother Mr Oung You-ming, had shortly before been charged in connection with a stock trading scandal. The former received a three-and-a-half year jail sentence, later overturned, while the latter fled to Malaysia, where he still lives. She became even more worried by uncertainties about the legal and financial arrangements for the project. It was unclear, she said, which part of the sprawling Hualon group would be responsible for it, what financial guarantees it would put up and who stood behind them. 'One of the key reasons I am resigning is that I still don't know who the IDB is doing this deal with,' she said. In June last year she wrote to Mr Tim Smith, then Northern Ireland minister, saying she was so concerned that she did not wish to be reappointed when her three-year term at the development board expired at the end of this year. At a lunch last August, she said, Mr Smith said he also wanted more information, notably about the legal position of the Oung brothers. He arranged a meeting with Mr John McGuckian, IDB chairman, and senior staff later in the month. Mrs d'Abo was dissatisfied with the answers she received at the later meeting and pressed for further information. Though she had been given more documents, including the agreement under which Hualon accepted the IDB's Pounds 61m in aid, she said they raised still more questions. Among the points which Mrs d'Abo said remained unclear were: Whether the development board was dealing with the Hualon Corporation in Taiwan, its Malaysian subsidiary headed by Mr Oung You-ming, or Textonnia, a Northern Ireland shell company set up by Hualon in connection with the project. On October 11, Mr Frank Hewitt, IDB deputy chief executive, told Mrs d'Abo that Hualon had not decided on the vehicle for funding the project. But two days later Mr George Foster, IDB executive director, told her the IDB was dealing with the Taiwanese Hualon group. The status of financial guarantees. When Hualon accepted the IDB's aid offer last May, she said, it undertook to inject at least Pounds 2.5m in cash into Textonnia two months after the deal was signed. But by the time she resigned, Mrs d'Abo said, none of the money had been paid. Mr Philip Chu, one of two directors of Hualon Malaysia who signed the undertaking, was not mentioned as a director of Textonnia. She was also unsure who Textonnia's shareholders were. The legal status of the IDB's deal with Hualon. Mrs d'Abo doubted that the funding contract for the project was still valid because of Hualon's apparent failure to put up the promised funds and because of delays caused by the possibility that the European Commission's approval of the aid this year might face a legal challenge from the UK textile industry. The IDB said yesterday the vehicle for the investment was Textonnia, which it said had paid up share capital of Pounds 100,000 and was owned by a company called Texton. Mrs d'Abo did not recall the project being put to a formal vote by the board. Instead, she said, Mr McGuckian, as chairman, simply noted in his summing up at a board meeting that all directors had agreed to it. In spite of her doubts, she did not oppose the project outright at the time. 'I did not have the guts or all the information I needed,' she said. However, after another Taiwanese stock market scandal last month - allegedly involving Mr Oung Ta-ming, several senior Hualon executives and two brokerage houses linked to the group - she asked Mr McGuckian to hold a special board meeting to review the project. He turned down her request. The last straw, she said, was when she asked a fellow IDB director to raise questions about the stock trading affair at a board meeting last week which she could not attend. She said the inquiries were simply brushed aside. 'I suddenly decided enough was enough. I was being stonewalled, and nobody was listening to me,' she said yesterday. She hoped her resignation would prompt a full public inquiry into the project. 'I'm all for creating new jobs but only if we have got the right partner,' she said. That lesson, she added, had been learned at huge cost from the collapse in the late 1970s of the De Lorean car venture.   Companies:-  Hualon Corp.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Sir Patrick, the Northern Ireland secretary and a former attorney-general, is to appear before Lord Justice Scott tomorrow, taking a break from his efforts to restart talks on Ulster's political future in order to do so. Sir Patrick will be the first member of the present cabinet to give evidence to the inquiry. He is expected to try to rebut this week's allegations by Sir Hal Miller, ex-MP and former Conservative party vice-chairman, that he tried to dissuade Sir Hal from giving evidence in support of a businessman accused of illegally exporting parts for the Supergun. Sir Patrick has denied the claim, saying he had never urged Sir Hal to withhold evidence which would benefit a defendant. In a statement yesterday Sir Patrick told a hushed Commons he had been invited to 'take an opportunity to give oral evidence to Lord Justice Scott's inquiry on Thursday. I very gladly shall avail myself of that opportunity.' Like other witnesses, Sir Patrick will not be under oath. Challenged elsewhere, ministers stonewalled questions on topics being considered by Lord Justice Scott. Asked by Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, for an assurance that the government had not coached witnesses from Walter Somers, a Midlands engineering company, before they gave evidence to a parliamentary Supergun inquiry last year, Mr Tony Newton, the Commons leader, said the most 'appropriate' course for ministers was to allow the Scott inquiry to proceed. For Labour, Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, tried to draw other ministers into the arms-for-Iraq web, naming 10 members of the present cabinet - including Mr John Major, the prime minister. The controversy over Sir Hal's allegations has effectively forced Lord Justice Scott to rearrange his schedule of hearings. After Monday no further public hearings were planned until June 11. Separately, Mr Gerald Kaufman, former shadow foreign secretary, said last night Sir Hal's evidence was in flat contradiction to a letter sent to him last November by Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary. The letter said the government did not learn of the involvement of British companies in supplying tubes for the Supergun until March 30, 1990. Sir Hal has said he alerted three government agencies about the project in June 1988. Secretive service exposed, Page 9 Observer, Page 19   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

But on the eve of the second meeting within a week between Mr John Major, the British prime minister, and Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish premier, officials conceded that Dublin's demand for a new all-Ireland convention was a crucial stumbling block. In London officials said they were confident that the proposed declaration - likely to be finalised at a third meeting between the two leaders next week  -would include firm guarantees for the unionist majority in Northern Ireland. Those guarantees would centre on Dublin's recognition that any change in the province's status could be achieved only by consent and a commitment to drop its constitutional claim to the north. It is understood that Britain has agreed to recognise the legitimacy and validity of the nationalist aspiration of Irish unity and to repeat publicly the offer to Sinn Fein of a place in negotiations if they end violence. Mr Major may also reaffirm that he has no strategic interest in maintaining Northern Ireland as part of the union, and signal a willingness to accept separate referenda in the north and south on any political settlement. But the British side has rejected as unacceptable to unionists the establishment of an all-Ireland convention. Yesterday Mr Gerry Adams, the leader of Sinn Fein, defined the key issues for a total cessation of violence as 'sovereignty, self-determination for the people of Ireland, and the role of the British government in assisting in a process of national reconciliation'.

Mr Clinton said: 'While much work remains to be done, the IRA's decision to join the political process can mark the beginning of a new era that holds the promise of peace for all the people of Northern Ireland.' From the Massachusetts island of Martha's Vineyard, where he is on holiday, Mr Clinton said: 'I urge the IRA, and all who have supported it, to fulfil the promise of today's announcement to end the use and support of violence, just as we continue to call on all parties who have sought to achieve political goals through the use of violence to cease to do so. There must be a permanent end to violence.' Mr Clinton, who spoke by telephone yesterday morning with Mr John Major, the prime minister, and his Irish counterpart, Mr Albert Reynolds, said he was 'pleased that the US has been able to contribute to this process of reconciliation', and was ready to assist in advancing the process of peace. He gave no details of any possible increase in US financial aid to Northern Ireland. US officials are discussing a financial package, although figures have not yet been decided. White House officials said there were no plans yet for any joint meeting of Mr Clinton, Mr Reynolds and Mr Major, but they were 'aware of interest from the Irish government' in such a meeting. Privately, some White House officials see the ceasefire announcement as vindication of their decision - overriding objections from the Departments of State and Justice, and the British government - to allow Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, to enter the US in February. The European Commission said it would step up its efforts to aid the province. Mr Jacques Delors, the commission president, took the opportunity to stress the importance of the 'European dimension'. He said he would discuss 'additional financial and other measures' with the UK and Irish governments. Mrs Pauline Green, leader of the European Parliament's largest bloc, the 198-strong Socialist Group, urged 'all sections of the community in Northern Ireland to seize the historic opportunity for peace that is now before them'.

0,FT934-1537 ,"FT934-1537 _AN-DLSAAAA9FT 931218   FT  18 DEC 93 / Dublin 'forum' to speed Sinn Fein involvement      By TIM COONE      DUBLIN   The Irish government's proposal to establish a 'peace forum' - referred to in this week's joint UK-Irish declaration - is aimed at bringing Sinn Fein rapidly into a formal negotiating process after the IRA has announced the ending of violence. Senior cabinet ministers say Sinn Fein could be brought into the Irish forum 'very quickly' after an announcement. This would be before the exploratory talks the British government has offered the party, which would start after a three-month 'quarantine' period. The ministers also echoed the British government's view that a surrender of IRA weapons would not be a precondition to the involvement of Sinn Fein in talks. Mr Albert Reynolds, the taoiseach, told the Dail yesterday: 'The joint declaration was the first stage in the peace process. The Forum for Peace and Reconciliation could be absolutely vital to reaching a second stage, and to achieving a permanent cessation of violence. 'If we want to be realistic, we have to guarantee that there will be a political process, once violence is permanently ended. The forum could provide a useful input to wider negotiations.' The creation of such a forum was one of the main sticking points in the drafting of the joint declaration. Irish government officials say it was therefore decided to make it an Irish initiative, rather than a joint initiative with Britain. Mr Reynolds said the forum would be modelled on the New Ireland Forum, set up in 1983 on the initiative of Mr John Hume, the leader of the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party in Northern Ireland, in which all the main parties in the Republic and the SDLP participated, but which the unionist parties in the north boycotted. Mr Reynolds said the new forum would be open 'to democratically mandated parties to provide a means to debate and devise appropriate alternative political strategies to violence'. Apparently acknowledging that unionist parties will not initially wish to be involved, he said the debate would take place 'among all strands of nationalism and hopefully a wider range of opinion, (and) in the aftermath of a permanent cessation of violence, could be a very healthy exercise in advance of resumed talks between all political parties, unionist and nationalist'. Dublin sees the forum as providing a 'bridge' to exploratory Sinn Fein talks with London and to subsequent wider talks involving all parties in Northern Ireland and the Republic. Dublin believes the move is necessary if Sinn Fein and the IRA are to accept the peace initiative. Issues of concern to Sinn Fein and the IRA, such as the future of IRA prisoners and the 'dumping' of arms, would be dealt with in these initial talks. Mr John Bruton, leader of the opposition Fine Gael party, expressed reservations. 'A forum that does not contain representatives of both traditions cannot achieve the stated objective in the joint declaration to promote reconciliation. There is a risk that some form of institutionalisation of division may be established.' The Irish parliament later backed the joint declaration without a vote at the end of a day-long debate in the Dail. Winding up the Dail debate, Mr Dick Spring, the deputy premier and foreign minister, said he would brief fellow members of the EC's General Affairs Council in Brussels on Monday.

Galmoy will be the first new base metal mine in Ireland for 20 years and enhance the country's position as Europe's second-largest zinc producer. The planning appeal was widely considered in the mining industry to be a test case, setting the scene for a new generation of mining in Ireland where the industry has been the target of a strong - and often successful - anti-mining campaign for some years. Arcon International Resources, the Dublin-based company in which Mr Tony O'Reilly, the Irish businessman, has a 23 per cent stake, said that, subject to it being issued with a department of energy mining licence, construction of the Galmoy mine would start in September and be completed in 18 months. Galmoy is projected to produce an annual 70,000 tonnes of zinc when in full production (which should be 12 months after start-up), employ 350 in the 18-month construction phase and then provide 200 permanent jobs. Professor Richard Conroy, Arcon's chairman, said the planning appeal outcome showed that 'there will be severe environmental scrutiny of any projected mine (in Ireland) but, as long as this scrutiny can be met, you will be able to mine. I hope this will encourage other mining companies to look for base metals in Ireland.' Environmentalists opposed to Galmoy gained some consolation from the appeal because Arcon has now been instructed to put a berm (ledge) around its waste pond. Tara Mines, owned by Outokumpu, the state-controlled Finnish group, is Ireland's only zinc producer with annual output of 190,000 tonnes. However, only 8kms from Galmoy is the Lisheen zinc project, close enough to suggest there is a series of big zinc-lead deposits over a wide area in the so-called Rathdowney trend. Mr Eero Laatio, managing director of Tara, recently estimated that the development of Galmoy and Lisheen would create more than 5,000 jobs.   Companies:-  Arcon International Resources.

Yet, after his more than 20 years in the Dail, there are few politicians with a more acute knowledge of the workings of parliament. At 47, and with a wealth of ministerial portfolios under his belt, the real question is whether he has the qualities of diplomacy and political toughness that Ireland needs at this watershed in its history. Ireland is entering uncharted waters. The Northern Ireland peace process is at a critical juncture as paramilitaries enter exploratory talks with UK officials and unionists await the publication of the important joint framework document which London and Dublin hope will form the basis for all-party talks on Ulster's future. Mr Bruton will enter the process at the head of an uneasy coalition of conservative and radical elements led by Fine Gael, an essentially conservative party, and including Labour, the party of modern European secular politics, and the Democratic Left, the successor of the Official IRA. Personality problems may resurface. Mr Bruton believes he was let down when Mr Dick Spring, leader of the Labour party, went into coalition with Fianna Fail in 1992. The two politicians also squabbled over economic policy in the last Fine Gael-Labour coalition, which fell in 1987. Today one key difference is that not only is there a shared determination to keep Fianna Fail out of office, but the economy's strength will make decisions on sensitive issues like public spending less divisive. Mr Bruton's first task is to assert control over his own party machine. A challenge in the short term is unlikely but any slip could precipitate one. The policy objectives are well signposted. On Northern Ireland, Mr Bruton's team will have to pick up where the outgoing government left off, while stamping its own character on the peace process. How he will balance the need to keep hardline republicans harnessed to the peace process, without compromising his sympathies for the northern unionists, is difficult to see. In a deliberately low-key acceptance address to the Dail last week, Mr Bruton stressed his greatest concern was to see progress sustained. If the outgoing administration secured the peace, he said, his task would be to foster the 'reconciliation' of the island's two religious traditions. In the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation on Friday, his first meeting with Mr Gerry Adams, leader of Sinn Fein (the IRA's political wing), provided little more than a cursory handshake. Few believe Mr Bruton can replicate the rapport Fianna Fail enjoyed with the republicans. Fine Gael, historically identified as the party which voted for the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921 which enshrined partition, is still not comfortable with Sinn Fein. But in Mr Prionsias De Rossa, Democratic Left leader, Mr Bruton will have a useful ally. A former IRA internee, Mr De Rossa provides ample evidence of the benefits that accrue to those republicans who abandon the bullet in favour of the ballot box. On social questions like divorce and abortion there is more common ground between the parties. Mr Bruton campaigned in favour of legalising divorce when it was last put to a referendum in 1986. All three parties seem agreed it may be over-ambitious to contemplate winning backing in a referendum substantive reforms legalising abortion, although there may be a good chance of passing legislation on an abortion information bill allowing women to be referred by doctors to specialists outside Ireland. Perhaps the area where there will be most strain will be on the economy. Mr Bruton's Fine Gael is the party of low taxation and tight spending. Labour and the more radical Democratic Left will want to take a more Keynesian approach, injecting spending into the economy to create jobs and reduce the burden of poverty for the lower paid and unemployed. Mr Bruton's first test is to see a new budget through parliament. Democratic Left, in charge of the big spending social welfare portfolio, is expected to push for a mildly expansionary budget in an attempt to ease unemployment. Mr Bruton's budget record is far from convincing. In 1982, when he was finance minister in Dr Garret Fitzgerald's coalition, his attempts to impose VAT on child clothing and shoes was opposed by independents. This led to the defeat of his budget, and eventually the coalition's downfall.   Countries:-  IEZ  Ireland, EC.   Industries:-  P9111 Executive Offices.   Types:-  PEOP  People.

This year, for the first time, the job is being done by an outside contractor following the privatisation of the civil service's IT division last September. In a test case for the government policy of 'market testing', the civil service handed over its four ICL mainframes based at Stormont just outside Belfast to CFM, ICL's facilities management subsidiary and the UK's second-largest IT contractor to the public sector. CFM's Pounds 20m fixed-price contract will last for five years. The civil service's main aim was to cut costs and move to a more commercial footing. But there were other factors as well. In particular, FM has extricated the government from a tricky problem - how to respond to the migration of work from the central IT service to the micros and minicomputers installed by individual ministries. 'Because individual departments were doing more of their own computing, the central bureau was showing a declining trend in its service over time. Looking ahead two or three years, one would wonder what it would be like,' says Derek Alexander, under secretary for IT at the Department of Finance and Personnel (DFP), which used to run the province's in-house IT service. In 1989 the IT centre started charging the departments for its service, and this compounded the problem. 'Systems would drop off but we were stuck with the same overheads,' says Alexander. 'In government you're expected to recover your costs, and so we had to raise the charges to customers whose requirements hadn't changed.' During that same year the DFP started to think seriously about privatising IT. After conducting a feasibility study which showed that substantial savings could be made, it put the contract out to tender in December 1990. Six bids were received including a proposal for a mangement buyout from the in-house team. 'We pointed to value-for-money and cost as being major criteria,' says Alexander. 'But we also emphasised the quality of the technical solution, the ease of implementation, the plans each firm had to grow the business, the credibility of the company and its previous FM experience, their approach to personnel issues and their commitment to the province.' Strong union opposition to the deal brought the personnel issue to the fore. None of the bidders would have had the resources to carry out the FM contract without persuading most of the staff to move. So it was in their interests to offer an attractive package to DFP staff. Alexander is pleased with the way things have gone so far. Since CFM took over, the computer centre has cut its costs by about 15 per cent. Measuring the saving is not easy because the department had been getting smaller and would have cut costs on its own if a bid from the in-house team had been successful. However, the centre is now saving Pounds 1.8m annually. Some 110 of the 190 IT staff working for DFP were re-employed by CFM while the rest were offered other civil service jobs. CFM took on 34 staff from outside but there were no compulsory redundancies. Perhaps the most visible discipline to be introduced since CFM's arrival is that of service level agreements between the contractor and its clients inside the civil service. CFM has responsibility for providing Northern Ireland's six government departments with more than 50 computer applications. Apart from the pig census, there are systems for planning applications, benefit payments, road maintenance, and the production of poll cards for the general election. The company has drawn up detailed agreements with each government department quantifying exactly what they are paying for. The help desk which serves all departments, for example, is committed to resolving 75 per cent of all users' problems within 10 minutes. Service level agreements are a constant reminder of the commercial basis of DFP's seemingly cosy partnership with CFM. At the moment both companies share the same building. A harder edge to the relationship may develop after next summer when CFM moves to its own multi-million pound computer site currently under construction on a Belfast industrial park. The move will be good for both parties, freeing 35,000 square feet of office space for the civil service, and boosting CFM's identity in Northern Ireland where the civil service contract is only a bridgehead. CFM will chase further FM work from the civil service - perhaps winning back some of the minicomputer-based systems that have migrated to individual departments. However, its plans in the province extend far beyond FM. Revenue from the civil service deal will help it break into other markets, says general manager Robert Bailes. In particular, it wants to set up an electronic data interchange network to facilitate trade between Northern Ireland and the rest of Europe. CFM may also undertake work for its parent, ICL. This is likely to be data centre work and software development which will help reduce overheads for the civil service. The company already has 40 software developers dedicated to civil service systems. Existing government software is always changing - after a Budget for example - and new systems are usually in train. One current project is the development of a grant system for small businesses trying to start up in Northern Ireland. Should an outside company be entrusted with systems that handle confidential information? It's not a problem, says Alexander. 'The Ministry of Defence runs plenty of non-IT operations on an FM basis that are just as sensitive as anything we handle here.'  The Financial Times   London Page 22  "
0,FT943-3202 ,"FT943-3202 _AN-EIOC7ADBFT 940915   FT  15 SEP 94 / Survey of Northern Ireland (8): A sombre message - Shipbuilding      By TIM COONE   In popular perceptions of Northern Ireland, the two huge gantry cranes at the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast loom as large as an Ulster fried breakfast or the booming voice of the Rev Ian Paisley. But while neither of the latter are likely to diminish in volume or disappear from the Northern Ireland scene in the coming few years, the same could not be said with total certainty of the shipyard. The Harland and Wolff cranes, once the most potent symbol of Northern Ireland's manufacturing industry, may become redundant by the end of next year if the shipyard is unable to win new orders in the face of increasingly stiff international competition. The hull of the last order on the yard's books - a Capesize bulk carrier - is taking shape on the floor of the main building dock, one of the largest building docks in the world, designed to accomodate vessels up to 1.2m tons dwt, twice the size of the largest ship ever built. The last ship is a relatively modest 162,000 dwt Capesize bulk carrier, but is one of a new generation of bulk carriers and tankers featuring enhanced structural and safety features in which HW now specialises. Mr Per Neilsen, chief executive of the Harland and Wolff group, estimates that as many as 600 'newbuildings' of ships over 100,000 tons dwt will be required over the next five to six years - the category in which HW specialises. Some 25m tons of bulk carriers and tankers are now on order around the world. The HW yard has a capacity to build between four and six such ships per year, so the Belfast builder would be aiming to win only around 5 per cent of all orders worldwide, not - it would seem - an impossible task. Mr Neilsen points out though that world shipyard capacity is growing and that there have been big productivity increases in existing yards, 'there is more than enough capacity to meet the demand for renewing the fleet.' The problem for HW, which reported an operating loss of Pounds 10.1m for 1993, is that direct and indirect subsidies paid to competing shipbuilders overseas 'including several countries in the EC' is making it impossible for the Belfast yard to compete on price, despite large productivity increases that have been achieved in recent years. 'We can compete on cost with the best shipbuilders around. We have the cheapest overheads compared to similar shipyards,' he claims. Since the yard was privatised in 1989, productivity has doubled. The number of man-hours required to produce a Capesize ship has been cut in half he said, and overall workforce numbers in the shipbuilding division have been cut from 2,850 to 1,400. 'We've done everything that has been asked of us through the privatisation,' he says. Restrictive work practices have been eliminated, flexible work hours have been introduced, labour costs have been sharply reduced, and great emphasis is laid on quality control - 'the employees have been prepared to take up the challenge' he says. A technical co-operation programme has been in operation for several years with Kawasaki Industries in Japan, and the management style at the yard is now largely modelled on the Japanese system. At the same time the yard has given wholehearted support to the government's policy to eliminate all shipbuilding subsidies. But Mr Neilsen now wants the government to either improve ship financing facilities through the government-run Ship Finance Mortgage Corporation (SMFC) or to tackle more effectively those countries that continue to provide direct or indirect subsidies to their shipyards. He says the norm for many foreign shipyards is to offer finance guarantees for up to 80 per cent of the cost of construction, repayable over 12-15 years through government-backed finance schemes. In the US, ship finance is available for up to 87.5 per cent of cost, repayable over 25 years, if a shipowner uses a US yard. In the UK, the SMFC offers only 30-60 per cent of the capital cost payable over 8.5 years. Mr Neilsen says that using the SMFC scheme, a shipowner would be likely to face a negative cash flow for the first seven years of operation, making it uneconomic to build new tonnage in a UK yard - 'it will not matter how good our productivity is if the builder cannot finance the ship. An owner needs a lot of cash to build at HW' There has been sympathy expressed in Whitehall, he says, but so far this has not resulted in action: 'If the government isn't prepared to listen to us, then clearly we will have to go in another direction and rethink our support for a 'no-subsidy' policy.' 'I used to be an optimist. But I feel it is going to be difficult to compete commercially if we are not playing on a level field with our competitors. It is going to be extremely difficult to be in business in the longer term.' It is a sombre message coming from one of Northern Ireland's oldest and most famous industries. And hardly one likely to bring cheer to those problem areas of Belfast where unemployment in some neighbourhoods such as the Lower Falls Road or Sandy Row is higher than 60 per cent.

The move is likely within days and would be part of the government's staged response to the IRA ceasefire in Northern Ireland. The decision may be agreed at a meeting of Mr John Major and cabinet colleagues today. Ministers will use the meeting to conduct a detailed stock-taking of the situation in Ulster after last week's loyalist ceasefire. London is considering opening a 'reversible' dialogue with republican leaders. Senior ministers have come to recognise that they may never be given an unequivocal pledge that the IRA ceasefire is permanent. Ministers have acknowledged that such talks could be under way by Christmas. Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, said last week that the loyalist ceasefire made it harder for the Provisional IRA to return to violence. Moderate unionists, whose support for the peace process is vital, are not expected to object to an early move to lift the exclusion orders since many see them as a denial of the union's integrity. The exclusion order against Mr Adams, the Sinn Fein president, was made last October under the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1989. Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, refused to revoke it in January. The ban was referred to the European Court of Justice in July, with European judges asked to lay down legal guidelines on the competing interests of Mr Adams' right to move freely within the European Union, including the UK, and the government's right under European law to take action against him in the interests of national security.

Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland Secretary, is  considering a response to questions put by Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn  Fein president, and channelled to London through Dublin.    He will publish his answers this week, but is expected to  regard many of the points as matters for negotiation once the  IRA gives up violence.    Official sources made clear that the reply would be  determined by an assessment of whether the list amounts to a  genuine attempt to clear up misunderstandings or ambiguity.    The move has rekindled hardline Unionist suspicions that the  Government is prepared to engage in dialogue with the  republicans before they have agreed to a permanent end to  violence. The Government denies this.    Since the declaration was signed five months ago the  Government has refused repeated Sinn Fein requests for formal  clarification though some ministerial speeches have been  interpreted as attempts to address republican concerns.    Anger among some Unionists that the Government should even  contemplate answering Sinn Fein's points will have added to Sir  Patrick's determination to give no impression of succumbing to  republican demands for detailed amplification of the  declaration. He will argue that some of the issues raised have  already been amply dealt with in ministers speeches and  statements.    Mr Peter Robinson, deputy leader of the Democratic Unionist  Party, said: ""Once again we have a Government that lies and  deceives, a Government that tells us one thing and does another.""    More moderate Unionists were prepared to back the  Government's willingness to respond to the questions, provided  the answers made clear that there would be no further  accommodation of Sinn Fein without a permanent cessation of  violence.    Mr James Molyneaux, leader of the Ulster Unionists, said  that  while the IRA was merely engaging in a further ploy with no real  intention of ending terrorism, it was ""a good thing that their  bluff will be called and all will be revealed.""    Mr Ken Maginnis, MP for Fermanagh and South Tyrone, said:  ""The Government should indicate to Sinn Fein one overriding  pre-condition -- an unconditional end to violence.""    But with progress on the declaration held up and the  separate  political process suspended until after the European elections,  some Unionists fear that frustration at the lack of progress  will bring overtures to Sinn Fein from London and Dublin.    Mr John Taylor, MP for Strangford, accused the Government of  ""playing the tune"" of the IRA and said the province had lost  confidence in Sir Patrick.    The Irish prime minister, Mr Albert Reynolds, told Irish  radio from America where he briefed President Clinton at the  weekend: ""There is a price to be paid for peace and all parties  to the conflict in Northern Ireland should see it that way and  make their contribution towards removing all the blocks.""    Mr Adams told a meeting in Dublin that he wanted an end to  the clarification debate ""so we can all move the peace process  on to the next stage.""     "

The warning followed the first public signs of  dissension within the republican movement over the peace process.    After 90 minutes of talks at No 10, the leaders appealed for  an end to sectarian killings by the IRA and loyalist  paramilitaries. They said Sinn Fein could have a ""couple more  weeks"" to debate its response, provided there was a cessation of  violence.    But they stressed the two Governments would not delay their  own efforts to draw up a framework for political progress in  Northern Ireland which is likely to be considered at an  Anglo-Irish summit in London in July.    Mr Reynolds said: ""We are not waiting around for any more  prevarication on either side to stop the violence. We continue  with our own business.""    Earlier, Mr Gerry Adams, President of Sinn Fein, had  promised  a response to the Downing Street clarification after the  European elections on June 9, raising hopes that progress was  being made towards a settlement.    ""I am quite convinced that what is going to come out of this  process is a peace settlement,"" Mr Adams told BBC Radio 4's  Today programme.    But the first signs of a potential rift within Sinn Fein  emerged yesterday when the IRISH TIMES quoted a senior  republican source in west Belfast as saying there was no  possibility of Sinn Fein accepting the declaration, nor of the  IRA calling a permanent cease-fire on the basis of the  clarification provided by the Government.    Mr Richard McAuley, Sinn Fein's senior press officer, later  acknowledged that some republicans were saying things that were  harmful and ""clearly at odds with the leadership"". But he  dismissed suggestions of a split: ""We are only talking about a  small number who do not represent the views of thousands of  members of the party.""    However, his comments were seen as an acknowledgement that a  fierce debate is raging within the IRA leadership over the  declaration, with some influential figures refusing to agree to  an end to the 25-year terrorist campaign.    Ulster Unionists yesterday attacked Mr Adams for  prevaricating over the declaration while the IRA's campaign of  violence continued.    Mr Ken Maginnis, the Ulster Unionist security spokesman,  said  that Mr Adams might be preparing ""a further cynical and very  temporary cease-fire"" in order to maximise the Sinn Fein vote in  the European elections.    The British Government also remains sceptical about his  remarks, believing they are little more than ""politicking""  before the elections.    Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland Secretary, told the  Cabinet yesterday that Mr Adams had not advanced the peace  process, nor had he answered the only question concerning  people: When would the violence end?    At their meeting, Mr Major and Mr Reynolds discussed closer  co-operation on cross-border security following last week's  loyalist attack in Dublin.    They said progress was being made on a framework document  grounded in the declaration and on talks with the constitutional  parties-and would proceed with or without Sinn Fein.     "

His remarks in a keynote speech, almost a month after the  signing of the declaration, seemed to undermine Mr Major's blunt  refusal to elaborate on the agreement.    Sinn Fein's demands for clarification have been repeatedly  dismissed by Downing Street, which has accused the IRA of  attempting to enter talks without halting its campaign of  violence.    Mr Major's tough line was endorsed yesterday by Mr James  Molyneaux, the Ulster Unionist leader.    Mr Molyneaux said: ""Practically every paragraph cancels  itself out.    ""Where you have a phrase or a sentence that is repugnant to  any pro-Union citizen, that is immediately cancelled out in the  same paragraph by a counterstatement.""    Mr Reynolds's speech to the Irish Association at Dublin  Castle was aimed at both nationalists and Unionists and was  clearly designed to keep the peace process alive.    He said the Downing Street document did not provide a  solution in itself, but was merely the ""first step on the road""  to peace.    He made a strong attempt to reassure Unionists, stressing  that a united Ireland could not be imposed in the absence of the  ""freely given consent"" of a majority of people in Ulster.    Mr Reynolds added: ""Likewise the democratic right of  self-determination by the people of Ireland as a whole must be  exercised with and subject to the agreement and consent of a  majority in Northern Ireland.""    He said: ""Both governments accept that Irish unity would be  achieved only by those who favour this outcome, persuading those  who do not, peacefully and without coercion or violence.""    An attempt to impose a united Ireland without the consent of  a majority of Ulster people would be a recipe for instability.    And he added: ""There can only be a mutual process of  demilitarisation through confidence building on all sides.  Continuing violence and conflict is not merely evil, it is  futile.""    Mr Reynolds said the declaration, for the first time gave an  ""explicit, rock-solid"" guarantee that if a majority in Ulster  wanted a united Ireland, Britain would uphold that wish.    He declared: ""The beginning of every new journey holds some  fears. These can be overcome. The priority must be the  protection of human life. We want everyone to choose the path  to peace and turn away from the cul-de-sac of violence.""    Britain also explicitly acknowledged and agreed to support  the right of the Irish people to come together in whatever form  they choose.    He added: ""British imperialist interest in Ireland is dead,  even if we still have to resolve some of its legacy.""    Mr Reynolds also said: ""I would appeal to those with whom  the ultimate decision for peace now lies. Do not let this  opportunity pass. Do not because of the weight of the past, or  because of very natural instincts, condemn the people of either  community to another generation of suffering.""    Mr Reynolds's speech was made against a background of  continuing violence.    The Ulster Freedom Fighters shot and injured a Roman  Catholic  man in West Belfast.    And the IRA was blamed for a mortar attack on a joint  police/Army base at Crossmaglen.     "

British and Irish ministers are also to start talks on relations between the two countries, including possible replacements for the 1985 Anglo-Irish agreement. The breakthrough, brokered by Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, adds a rare momentum to all-party talks on the province's future which have taken place, off and on, for more than a year. It follows a 'talks about talks' meeting in London on Tuesday, where Irish ministers met hardline unionists for the first time since partition in the 1920s. Even moderate unionists had not negotiated with the Irish government since the 1973 Sunningdale conference. With participants maintaining confidentiality, it is unclear to what extent unionists and nationalists have agreed on proposals for devolution in the province - the subject of the first 'strand' of the present talks which have been taking place in Belfast for nine weeks. The Irish government was excluded from strand one. There may be an embryonic deal on a devolved assembly for the province with a 'panel' that would form a quasi-cabinet. But details of the assembly's powers and the composition of the panel would be highly symbolic for unionists and nationalists. Lack of progress in 'strand one' prevented, until yesterday, Sir Patrick from announcing the second and third strands - on relations between north and south Ireland and between London and Dublin respectively. As late as the weekend, the Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionist party, was insisting that later stages could not start until agreement was reached on a devolved government. However, Sir Patrick appears to have persuaded unionists not to block a start of 'strand two'.  The Financial Times   London Page 8  "

An Irish government official said Mr Albert Reynolds, the republic's prime minister, would seek to resolve the wrangle when he met Mr John Alderdice, the Alliance leader, on Friday. Mr James Molyneaux's Ulster Unionists and Rev Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionists have said they will not attend. A boycott by the Alliance would add to the perception among Protestants that the forum is a pan-nationalist front. With regard to seat allocation, a spokesman for the small, non-sectarian Alliance party said: 'Anything less than equal to Sinn Fein is completely unacceptable.' Under the proposed allocation Sinn Fein would have three seats, the Alliance two and the SDLP five. For the republic Mr Reynolds' Fianna Fail party would have nine seats, Labour five and Fine Gael six. The dispute comes amid renewed calls from Northern Ireland's moderate nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party for the UK to reduce its troop presence in the province to underpin the peace process. Dublin is keen to use the forum to build confidence between the two religious traditions on the island. The Alliance is moderate and non-sectarian, and unlike the main unionist parties it favours a Dublin contribution to any solution and is committed to the Anglo-Irish talks. It has never won a seat in parliament but has the same number of councillors as Sinn Fein, received only slightly fewer votes than Sinn Fein at the general election and had a bigger representation at the last Stormont assembly.

Mr Molyneaux's warning followed a meeting with Mr John Major, the prime minister, at which he confirmed that the UUP was willing to keep the door open to a further round of talks. However, it further complicates the peace process, which has shown signs of stalling in recent days because of growing tension between London and Dublin on the ceasefire issue. The Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the hardline Democratic Unionist party, also tried to block the talks yesterday by declaring he would 'never' negotiate with Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA. After a separate meeting with Mr Major, he said he had told the prime minister not to waste his time listening to 'the blarney and the lying from Dublin'. He said Mr Major had told him that if the Anglo-Irish initiative failed, the government would reconsider DUP proposals for an internal settlement based on power-sharing devolution. Mr Paisley's continued hostility to the Anglo-Irish initiative is a disappointment to the government, which had hoped that public pressure for peace would moderate the DUP approach. However, Mr Molyneaux's growing suspicion of Dublin's motives is potentially a far more serious blow to the peace process because of the UUP's much greater support among Ulster protestants. Mr Reynolds appeared to be 'drifting away' from the terms of his joint statement with Mr Major in Brussels two weeks ago. 'The position which has been put forward by Mr Reynolds is causing such unease that it may in fact block sensible progress within Northern Ireland,' he said. The Irish prime minister's focus on an early cessation of violence had caused 'a great deal of unease, confusion and instability in Northern Ireland'. Mr Reynolds was 'at least contemplating some kind of link up with the Hume-Adams talks, which can only mean an unacceptable series of concessions to terrorists'. A survey in today's Guardian shows that 59 per cent of 1,400 people polled in mainland Britain believe the IRA or Sinn Fein should be allowed to take part in peace talks. Some 44 per cent thought their participation should be conditional on ending the campaign of violence, while 15 per cent believed they should automatically be involved.

It also serves to underline the complexity of maintaining links with Iran, which often appears to be pursuing contradictory foreign policy aims. Officially, Iran wishes to improve its contacts with Britain and with most other industrialised nations. Mr Gholamreza Ansari, the senior Iranian diplomat in London, said after being summoned to the Foreign Office yesterday the meeting had been very friendly. 'I was informed about their concern', he said. 'I am sure it is not right, but I will be in contact with my country - definitely it is not right.' Mr Ansari is often seen at diplomatic receptions in London, smiling, affable, and presenting the face of Iran which is in line with official policy. But a visit to Tehran serves as a reminder that Iranian policy also remains committed to the export of the revolution and to offering assistance to 'oppressed Moslems' throughout the world. Officials deny there is anything sinister in this ambition. Words are our bullets, they say, stressing that many Moslems look to them for guidance. How those people choose to pursue their own domestic political struggles is a matter for them to decide. Similarly, they say, Iran cannot stand by when Islam is blasphemed, as was claimed the case with British author Salman Rushdie. Mr Javad Larijani, foreign policy adviser to President Ali Hashemi Rafsanjani, said in an interview last year that to withdraw the fatwa condemning Mr Rushdie to death would be like disowning Islam and the Koran. 'The withdrawal of the fatwa is not the sort of condition which British politicians should put on relations with Iran. It is quite unreasonable', said Mr Larijani. Britain has been equally adamant that full diplomatic relations could not be restored with Iran unless the fatwa was lifted. British officials add privately that at the very least they need assurances from Iran that no attempt will be made to carry out the fatwa, which was issued originally by the late Ayatollah Khomeini in February 1989. But in the absence of a single central authority in Tehran such an assurance would lack credibility, especially as the Iranian regime continues to pursue policies in the Middle East which are fundamentally opposed to British and other western interests. Iran, for example, is totally against the peace process under way between Israel, its Arab neighbours and the Palestine Liberation Organisation, is the main supporter of Hizbollah, the radical Shia faction in Lebanon, and would welcome an Islamic government in Algeria. Officials in Tehran find nothing contradictory in pursuing such policies while also seeking to establish a better working relationship with Britain. For them it is a matter of the British coming to terms with the reality of the Islamic republic. However, the accusation of links with the IRA can but lend support to US assertions that Iran should be shunned by the international community because of its links with terrorist organisations and alleged attempts to secure a nuclear weapons capacity. Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, was quick yesterday to express his anger at 'the continued terrorism projected by Iran' and to urge other countries against offering any economic assistance to Tehran. Guilty or not, Tehran is sure to seek popular support by presenting the British charges as evidence of further western attempts to undermine the Islamic government, and probably as an attempt to distract international attention from what is happening to the Moslem community in Bosnia. It is an interpretation which will be comfortably accepted by many Iranians, including those who did not support the revolution. Such people, steeped in conspiracy theories, continue to believe that the UK helped to topple the Shah in 1979, and claim that if anyone lifted up Ayatollah Khomeini's beard they would find stamped the words 'Made in Britain'.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Two in terrorism  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- IRISH REPUBLICAN ARMY  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Anti-British Irish republican militants have been active since 19th century.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Present core of organisation - the Provisional Irish Republican Army - dates from 1969, when Northern Ireland civil strife entered particularly bloody period.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Dedicated to forcing withdrawal of British troops from Northern Ireland and reunification of Irish nation.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Claiming to defend minority Catholic population in Northern Ireland, 'volunteers' have continued campaign of violence against majority Protestants, security forces, commerical targets and members of British political establishment.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- In recent years, developed sophisticated structure of command aimed at minimising risk of infiltration, and strengthened itself financially and militarily with support from Middle East and US and series of illicit business enterprises in Ireland and UK.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Believed to have hard core of several hundred trained terrorists with several thousand sympathisers.

But on the eve of the second meeting within a week between Mr John Major, the British prime minister, and Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, officials conceded that Dublin's demand for a new all-Ireland convention was a crucial stumbling block. In London officials said they were confident that the proposed declaration - likely to be finalised at a third meeting between the two leaders next week  -would include firm guarantees for the unionist majority in Northern Ireland. Those guarantees would centre on explicit recognition by Dublin that any change in the province's status could be achieved only by consent and a commitment by the Republic to drop its constitutional claim to the north. It is understood that Britain has agreed to recognise the legitimacy and validity of the nationalist aspiration of Irish unity and to repeat publicly the offer to Sinn Fein of a place in negotiations in return for an end to violence. Mr Major may also reaffirm that his government has no strategic interest in maintaining Northern Ireland as part of the union, and signal its willingness to accept separate referenda in the north and south on any political settlement. But the British side has rejected as unacceptable to the unionist parties the establishment of an all-Ireland convention and is resisting Dublin's demands to acknowledge publicly the right of self-determination across Ireland. The uncertain reaction of the IRA to any declaration was underlined by Mr Gerry Adams, the leader of Sinn Fein. At a party meeting in Belfast yesterday he defined the key issues for a total cessation of violence as 'sovereignty, self-determination for the people of Ireland, and the role of the British government in assisting in a process of national reconciliation'. He said Sinn Fein's involvement in political talks 'is not the main issue at this time'. He said the republican movement was not about to surrender, but added: 'We have taken risks and are prepared to take further risks to achieve a lasting peace . . . The opportunity for peace presented by the Irish peace initiative remains intact if it is seized and built upon and if Dublin puts the onus on Britain to deliver'.

0,FT934-7271 ,"FT934-7271 _AN-DKUAIAB3FT 931120   FT  20 NOV 93 / Major's risky crusade: The UK prime minister's Ulster initiative      By PHILIP STEPHENS   One of the more cruel truths of Northern Ireland is that politics has long favoured the status quo. No matter how vicious the violence, post-war governments on both sides of the Irish Sea have never been threatened by a failure to restore peace. Instead politicians in London have been mesmerised by the dangers of undercutting the Protestant, unionist majority. Irish leaders have looked over their shoulder at the nationalist aspirations of the Republic. In Belfast, the constitutional parties - Protestant and Roman Catholic - have felt safer with the status quo than with the risks of a new political settlement. Mr John Major this week declared it was time to end that depressing paralysis. After weeks of intensive contacts between London and Dublin he put Northern Ireland at the top of his personal agenda. He is ready to table his own comprehensive proposals for devolved government in Ulster and a re-definition of the relationships between Britain and the Republic, and between north and south. He made explicit the offer of a place in negotiations for Sinn Fein if the IRA called a permanent halt to their terrorist campaign. He said he was aiming for peace as well as a political settlement. He warned the hard-line Democratic Unionist Party of the Rev Ian Paisley it could not exercise a veto. Senior British officials said that all sides would have to make uncomfortable compromises. Mr Major, jolted by the terrorist atrocities which began with last month's IRA bombing of Belfast's Protestant Shankill Road, was ready to do so. He is confident of his own skills as a conciliator and negotiator. He is spending more time on Northern Ireland than on any other subject. Not everyone thinks it is a wise decision. The high-profile approach is described variously in Whitehall as naive and dangerous, as well as courageous. His advisers say he knows it is a high-risk strategy. Old Ulster hands regard that as a understatement. Mr Major sees the rewards as well as the risks. An end to the killing after 25 bloody years would be the ultimate prize. But even a political deal which fell short of that would do much to restore his authority. A discernible mood for peace on both sides of the Irish border, however, cannot of itself untie the knot which has wrecked past initiatives. Nor will it erase centuries of mistrust. Mr Major must find the elusive formula which reassures the unionist majority they retain a veto over constitutional change and recognises the nationalist aspirations of the Republic and the Catholic minority in Ulster. So at the kernel of any agreement there must be a willingness on Dublin's part to modify its constitutional claim to sovereignty, and a recognition by unionists that the Republic has a legitimate interest in the way the north is governed. None of this is new. Some of these realities are incorporated into the 1985 Anglo-Irish agreement. Mr Garret Fitzgerald, the then Irish prime minister, offered in 1984 to submit to a referendum the offending articles 2 and 3 of the Irish constitution. Lady Thatcher did not believe he could deliver and the idea was abandoned. Mr Major believes the mood has changed. He trusts Mr Albert Reynolds, his Irish counterpart. British officials say the two have a rapport. But as a leak of Dublin's draft proposals for a settlement revealed, the price it is demanding for renunciation of the South's territorial claim is still too high for Unionists. Though the words 'joint sovereignty' never appear, the idea suffuses the document. That runs straight into the unionists' determination to preserve the province's present status. Here the pivotal figure is Mr James Molyneaux, the 73-year-old leader of the Ulster Unionists. Mr Major is ready to accept that Mr Paisley's DUP may boycott talks. But the prime minister cannot get anywhere without the support of the nine Ulster Unionist MPs. Much has been made of the deal struck by the prime minister and Mr Molyneaux to secure the ratification of the Maastricht treaty in the summer. But the foundations of Mr Molyneaux's authority runs much deeper. Mr Major, a self-declared unionist, cannot agree anything without the consent of the Protestant majority. Mr Molyneaux' veto is cast-iron. So far he has kept his counsel on Mr Major's initiatives. But some suspect he expects the process to founder. Mr Major might then have to accept unionists' agenda for integrating the province more fully into the UK. Mr John Hume of the mainly Catholic SDLP has a different sort of veto. His joint initiative with Mr Gerry Adams of Sinn Fein was rejected in both Dublin and London. But to the discomfort of Mr Major, Mr Reynolds has taken on board the idea that peace is an essential ingredient of any political settlement. No Irish government can disown the SDLP Then there is Sinn Fein. British intelligence reports suggest Mr Adams may be serious about extricating the IRA from violence. But there is no certainty and many risks. There is unease on the Tory backbenches about 'concessions' to terrorists. One minister warned that, if Mr Major leans too far towards Sinn Fein, the resultant split in the Tory party would make Maastricht seem a 'tea party'. In the past few weeks London and Dublin have cleared some of the historical debris strewn across the path to peace. But for all his determination Mr Major has no idea yet whether he has set off along another cul de sac.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P9721 International Affairs.

After all, the man responsible for the ruling which got Mr John Major and ministers off the hook on Maastricht was never the sort of MP on whom successive Tory governments could rely for unquestioning loyalty - even before he was made a deputy speaker. In his 19 years in the Commons Mr Michael Wolfgang Laurence Morris has quietly built up a reputation for independent-mindedness on issues close to his heart, while managing until recently to keep out of the limelight. Perhaps his best-known act of rebellion during a long backbench career was in twice opposing the Moore-Clarke National Health Service reforms in late 1989 (his wife is a general practitioner). But his dissent was not confined to a single issue. A study of divisions in the 1989-90 parliamentary session put him ninth equal on the list of Tory rebels. The key role in Maastricht proceedings he has been given by virtue of his chairmanship of the ways and means committee has finally forced him out of Westminster's shadows. His trademark bow-tie is fast becoming as well-known as Mr Tristan Garel-Jones's cape or Mr Kenneth Clarke's Hush Puppies. Few would claim that his independence has been compromised, however. 'I think he has been tough, but he has been tough on all sides,' says Mr Jim Cran, one of the Tory Euro-sceptic leaders, speaking before yesterday's ruling. Mr George Robertson, Labour's European affairs spokesman, said: 'He has now found his moment and is doing superbly well.' By common consent the MP for Northampton South has handled the sometimes tortuous series of Maastricht debates with wit, skill and imperturbable authority. His initiative in meeting MPs with a particular interest in Maastricht before the beginning of the committee stage to establish ground-rules and assure them of his good faith, is seen as typical of his high level of preparation. Mr Morris is also credited with the decision to divide the copious amendments to the tiny three-clause bill into easily manageable groups to help ensure all subjects were adequately debated. Before yesterday's ruling his stock had risen particularly high among opposition and Euro-sceptic MPs after he consented last month to allow a debate on the government's embarrassing u-turn over its legal advice. But a 13-year stretch on the powerful cross-party public accounts committee of MPs has evidently helped to instil in him an aversion to humbug. He has been prepared to put protagonists on both sides of the Maastricht divide firmly in their place when his patience has been taxed. A marketing specialist, Mr Morris began his professional career with Reckitt  Colman and is a past leader of Islington council. His south Midlands seat  -now ultra-safe - was marginal when he won it. His sole taste of government came in a two-year stint as parliamentary private secretary in the Northern Ireland Office more than a decade ago. He subsequently underlined his independence in 1982 by opposing the Northern Ireland Assembly Bill to set up a locally elected forum. A former captain of the parliamentary golf club and landowner who lists 250 acres of woodland in the register of members' interests, he is probably the only MP to include budgies in his Who's Who entry for recreations.

And the stock price was helped by bullish noises from Lehman Brothers, the US brokerage. BP said ADRs issued by Morgan Guaranty Trust of New York accounted for 19.54 per cent of BP's issued capital, or 1.07bn shares, down from a previous level of around 19.7 per cent and a high point of above 26 per cent last year. BP shares reached an all-time high of 430p last month. Shell edged up 3 to 730p as the market responded to a bullish press report on the outlook for petrochemicals. Exco, the money broking group which came to the market in the summer at 175p a share, lost 15 at 179p, after 180p, as the market reacted badly to news of the resignation, from December 31, of Mr Ron Sandler, the chief executive. He will be succeeded by Mr Peter Edge, who currently runs Exco's money broking business. Mr Sandler joined Exco in April last year and is thought to have crossed swords with the rest of the broker's board, according to dealers. 'It looks bad so soon after the flotation,' said one dealer. Exco reiterated the view that its performance for the year 'will be satisfactory' but also warned of subdued trading in the third quarter. The dollar's retreat affected HSBC, whose fortunes are viewed as linked to those of Hong Kong. HSBC shares, which began to weaken late last week, slipped 7 to 716p. Guinness put on 5 at 465p, with NatWest Securities adding the shares to its Top 15 performing stocks.

Det Chief Supt Derek Waites of the Royal Ulster Constabulary anti-racketeering squad told a London conference that the terrorists - who raised about Pounds 10.5m a year to fund their activities - took Pounds 1.5m a year from pirate video sales. 'The reality is that the easy profit from video piracy turns a popular entertainment into bullets and bombs,' said Mr Waites. He said the RUC had already seized more than 100,000 illicit videos in Northern Ireland. Recent co-ordinated seizures in the Irish Republic had involved a further 100,000. The RUC experience was outlined at a conference organised by the Federation Against Copyright Theft, an all-industry body designed to stamp out piracy. Mr Nick Hill, the federation's chairman, said the video market in the UK for sale and rental was now worth Pounds 1bn a year. 'What is not so well known is that the illegal video market is a major source of funding for organised crime as well as costing our business in the region of Pounds 250m a year,' said Mr Hill. Raids have uncovered as many as 180 linked video machines capable of turning out thousands of illicit copies a week - 20 per cent of them non-certificated, illegal videos which have never been submitted to the British Board of Film Censors. Often the illicit cassettes are sold at car boot sales or at about 7,000 unregulated markets regularly held in the UK. Mr David Groom, a barrister who has prosecuted a number of large-scale piracy cases, said that in virtually every case there were links with organised crime and pornography. Sometimes there were links with terrorism. He believes that the present punishments under patents-and-designs copyright legislation - a maximum of two years in prison - are inadequate given the scale of the problem. He now uses the Forgeries Act, in cases where counterfeit labels and packaging have been seized, to try to obtain stiffer penalties. Mr Reg Dixon, director-general of Fact, and a Metropolitan Police detective for nearly 30 years, called for it to be made an offence to knowingly purchase a counterfeit video. At the moment it is an offence to buy a genuine video of Aladdin knowing it to have been stolen but not to buy a cassette that you know has been illegally copied.

[Adams] No, never. Where did you get that idea from?    [Correspondent] Are you acquainted with the persons who  carried out this terrorist action?    [Adams] No. You forget that the Sinn Fein is separate from  the IRA.    [Correspondent] If you are not acquainted with IRA leaders,  how can you make the IRA stop its armed operations?    [Adams] One does not have to know the IRA activists  personally in order to move things along. My wish is to  demilitarize the Anglo-Irish conflict. Two armed groups are  facing each other in this conflict, the British Army and the  militant pro-British groups from Northern Ireland on the one  hand, and the relatively smaller IRA on the other. They must  all lay down their arms at the same time.    [Correspondent] You are the Irish politician with the  greatest influence on the IRA leadership because of your origins  as a Catholic-Republican resistance fighter. You cannot say you  have no connection with the IRA leadership.    [Adams] I have never dissociated myself from the IRA. That  would be a dishonorable thing to do. But while I am politically  active, the IRA is an armed, secret organization. I would like  it to stop its actions.    [Correspondent] Do you see any chance of that?    [Adams] The IRA is not going to stop unilaterally. In order  to speed the peace process along, I would like the British  Government to commence talks with our Sinn Fein. Then I could  go to the IRA and, hopefully, offer it a packet of solutions  that would permit it to reach a final decision on future policy.  The British Army has been trying to beat the IRA for 25 years.  But the IRA has not been beatable. On the contrary, it looks  as if the IRA could continue its armed actions forever.    [Correspondent] In other words, war to the very last?    [Adams] No. For Ireland, there is no military solution. We  have a political problem here, and it needs a political  solution. I have been trying to break the military stalemate  for years. Several times the IRA has publicly said that the  initiative coming from me and from John Hume, leader of the  Social Democratic party in Northern Ireland, could provide the  basis for peace. Hume and I suggested a roundtable of all  parties involved.    [Correspondent] Your credibility as a man of peace collapsed  when you were one of the pall-bearers of the coffin of the IRA  terrorist Thomas Begley, who killed nine persons in a bomb  attack in Belfast's Shankill Road. Does this gesture not have  the effect of a nod of approval to violence?    [Adams] What is violence? There is institutionalized  violence, the violence of the state. I was a victim of this  violence when the British Army locked me up for five years.    [Correspondent] Let us not get philosophical. What do you  say to the murder of innocent civilians?    [Adams] I am against that, of course. What happened in  Shankill Road was unforgivable and wrong.    [Correspondent] Then why do you help carry Begley's coffin?    [Adams] The man was dead. Why should I not carry his coffin  at his funeral? I am not going to leave Thomas Begley's family  alone in their grief. I would feel the same way about any  family that loses a 19 year old son. We cannot make teenagers  responsible for this conflict -- neither British soldiers, nor  young Protestants, nor IRA volunteers.    [Correspondent] After 25 years of bloodshed and 3,400  deaths, you said during your recent U.S. visit that ""this  generation is going to see peace in Ireland."" What makes you so  sure?    [Adams] The world climate of solving conflicts. If I had  said five years ago that Nelson Mandela would be released from  prison and become South Africa's president-designate, everyone  would have thought I was joking. The conflict seemed insoluble.    [Correspondent] Just like the conflict in Northern Ireland.    [Adams] I hope the progress in Africa also provides a signal  for people here in Ireland. The turnabout in South Africa  occurred because Mandela's enemy, the government of Pretoria,  was prepared to swallow the bitter pill and make concessions  that set the process in motion. The government in London should  learn something from that.    [Correspondent] Nonetheless, the London government has  already taken a big step and held secret talks with the IRA and  Sinn Fein. Do you think Prime Minister Major is determined to  find a political solution for Northern Ireland?    [Adams] British public opinion would surely approve the  taking of risks in order to achieve peace in Ireland, but  unfortunately Major is too much a victim of the obsessions of  his party's right wing, as well as being a victim of the  Unionists, the Northern Irish party that wants Northern Ireland  to belong to Great Britain at all costs. Major's weakness is an  obstacle to a peaceful solution. That is why we must seek other  ways of attaining our goal.    [Correspondent] London treats you like a persona non grata.  You cannot travel to England, Scotland, or Wales, and you  cannot be heard or seen on radio or television.    [Adams] That is just one example of the British Government's  stupidity.    [Correspondent] You and your family survive all attacks.  Once you were hit by five bullets when you entered a Belfast  restaurant. Do you feel in greater danger now that you are  involved in the peace process?    [Adams] I feel no hatred toward the people who tried to  shoot  me, nor toward those who might be planning to do so now. That  is the way things are here. Men act this way because they see  me as a danger to their interests. There is only one way: The  armed wings of the radical pro-British groups must be involved  in the peace process just like the IRA.    [Correspondent] Are you really prepared to sit down at the  negotiating table with your archenemies the Protestants?    [Adams] This has nothing to do with religion. My enemies  are not the Protestants. We are talking about political groups,  and they must all take part in the talks. There must be  dialogue without preconditions. Certain people have been  excluded for too long, and that is why no progress has been made.    [Correspondent] With your readiness for compromise, you will  also turn IRA hardliners into your opponents. For them, your  policy means treason. Do you not think that the next bullet  fired at you might come from an IRA weapon?    [Adams] No. The IRA would have to join the back of the line  of my potential assassins.     "

In the government's most detailed summary of its contacts with Sinn Fein, Mr Michael Ancram, Northern Ireland minister, said the meetings were with council delegations including a Sinn Fein councillor. They had been to discuss local constituency matters. Responding to a parliamentary written question by Mr Jeremy Corbyn, Labour MP for Islington North, Mr Ancram said the government's main sources of information about Sinn Fein's views were 'public ones such as written documents and reports of interviews'.

0,FT944-18148 ,"FT944-18148 _AN-EJED5ACEFT 941005   FT  05 OCT 94 / IRA beatings may delay peace talks      By STEWART DALBY, DAVID GARDNER and GEORGE GRAHAM      BELFAST, BRUSSELS   The continuing use of punishment beatings in republican areas of Belfast - thought to be the work of the provisional IRA - could delay the start of talks between London and Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing. A British official yesterday warned: 'All military activity may have stopped, strictly speaking, but the violence in republican areas is continuing. We have to consider whether this is terrorism by another name.' London has promised to start a dialogue on how to admit Sinn Fein to political talks on Northern Ireland's future within three months of a permanent end to IRA violence. The emergence of a possible new obstacle to the peace process coincided yesterday with mixed signals on the prospects for financial aid for the province to help smooth the path to a durable settlement. Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, said the European Union should decide by Christmas on whether to make new aid grants focusing on urban renewal and infrastructure. The 'peace grants' would be in addition to EU funds already committed to the province, he said after he and Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, briefed EU foreign ministers on recent developments. Specific sums were not mentioned yesterday but Mr Spring said he expected December's summit in Essen of EU leaders to agree a substantial package. Part of the new money could eventually go towards dismantling the 'peace walls' separating the two northern communities, senior officials said. But Mr Hurd made it clear that could only happen 'if people want it to happen'. The EU has allocated Ecu1.23bn (Pounds 960m) in aid to northern Ireland for 1994-99, and raised its annual contribution to the International Fund for Ireland from Ecu15m to Ecu20m. US officials have been trying to lower the level of expectations. A senior administration official said: 'I don't think any large assistance package of direct aid is on the cards. We just don't have that kind of budget flexibility.' Dr John Alderdice, leader of the non-sectarian Alliance party, also drew this conclusion from his talks with US officials this week. The White House is examining less direct forms of aid, such as enhancing the role of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation and accelerating spending from the International Fund for Ireland - to which the US contributes. The continuing violence will be another obstacle for Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, as he tries to increase pressure on London to start talks on his return from the US later this week. A further three beatings came to light this week, taking the total number of beatings in republican ares to 10 since the IRA ceasefire on August 31. In the same period last year there was only one punishment beating. The provisional IRA has not admitted it is responsible for the beatings but the Royal Ulster Constabulary is convinced that it is.

In a letter sent to judges in England, Wales and Northern Ireland yesterday Lord Mackay, the Lord Chancellor, said: 'I believe that the time has come to reduce the retirement age for the judiciary, and also to introduce a standard retirement age for all judges and judicial officers.' Lord Mackay intends that the new retirement age should apply to all those appointed to full-time judicial office after the change comes into force. Judges who hold full-time positions on the day the change is made will be allowed to continue until the present retirement age of 75 provided they remain in the same job and are not promoted. A change in judges' retirement age will require primary legislation and so cannot be introduced until after the election.  The Financial Times   London Page 5  "

Mr John Hume, leader of the nationalist Social Democratic Labour party, speaking on Irish radio yesterday, dismissed as 'gamesmanship' and 'point scoring' unionist insistence that the Irish Republic drop its territorial claim to Northern Ireland, enshrined in its constitution, before any further progress at the talks can be made. The hardline Democratic Unionist party boycotted the Dublin phase of the talks last week, arguing that the Irish government had not shown any flexibility on the issue. The Ulster Unionist party attended the talks but little headway appeared to have been achieved. Mr Hume said the unionist position 'is not facing up to the real problem which is 'how do we live together in this island and how do we respect our differences?''. He added: 'If we were playing the same game, I would be demanding that the British constitution be changed because it is an extremely sectarian constitution. The Queen is the head of the Church of England. Church of England bishops have seats as of right in the House of Lords.' He also ruled out power sharing or majority rule as possible solutions that might emerge from the talks. Mr Hulme said that Northern Ireland 'is not a natural political entity because it was unnaturally drawn, the normal political standards do not work . . . that is a self-evident truth . . . We are not going to give back power to the unionists, full stop.' The Stormont parliament was dissolved in 1972, when direct rule from Westminster was introduced after the breakdown of law and order in the province. The SDLP proposal is for a commission of six people to govern the province, including representation from Dublin and the EC. The unionists have rejected that. The DUP said at the weekend it would abandon the talks entirely after November 16 - the date set for the next Anglo-Irish Conference meeting between the British and Irish governments - if agreement between the four Ulster parties and the two governments could not be reached by then. It would attend talks in Belfast this week only if the Republic's constitutional claim was being dealt with 'seriously'.  The Financial Times   London Page 8  "

Average weekly household expenditure throughout the country was Pounds 253.10, but it ranged from Pounds 210.52 in the north to Pounds 292.06 in greater London. Spending on food was highest in London at Pounds 51 a week and lowest in the north at Pounds 41. Households in East Anglia and Yorkshire and Humberside set aside an average 71p a week for their cod and chips, but the people of Northern Ireland spent only 29p. The biggest drinkers were in the north west, where households spent Pounds 12.45 a week on alcohol. This compared with Pounds 7.99 in greater London and a sober Pounds 7.55 in Ulster. However, Londoners easily beat rivals in drinking wines and spirits, spending Pounds 5.20 per household. The heaviest smokers were in Scotland, where weekly household expenditure on tobacco averaged Pounds 6.14, compared with Pounds 4.11 in the south-west and Pounds 3.90 in East Anglia. There was a different pattern for cigars and snuff where the biggest fans were the Welsh. The Welsh also topped the league for tea-drinking, spending 63p a week on the national brew. The Scots spent least on tea at 47p a week, while East Anglians and northerners spent the most on coffee - 55p - compared with only 33p in Northern Ireland.

Security services were alerted shortly after midnight when 'incendiaries' were fired near terminal four. However, an airport official said it appeared that none had detonated and there had been little damage. There were no reports of casualties. Scotland Yard officers later confirmed that three mortar shells were found in the south-east area of the airport close to terminal four. There were also reports of two suspicious packages. The airport's southern runway and a perimeter road were closed. The attack followed non-specific warnings to the media. Initial reports indicated that three thuds were heard, but police were unsure of the location of the launch site. The London Ambulance Service said it was alerted at 12.11am to 'an act of aggression' at Heathrow. Ambulances and fire engines were standing by. The second assault underlined fears in London and Dublin that the republican movement has rejected the peace initiative. Both governments were united in their condemnation of Wednesday's attack - which yesterday led to calls for an inquiry into security operations at Heathrow - and accepted the likelihood that it signalled rejection by the republican movement of the peace initiative. Nevertheless Mr John Major, the prime minister, insisted the search for peace would continue. Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, described as 'despicable' remarks made by Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, in a radio interview in which he appeared to warn of more possible events like Wednesday's attack on Heathrow. Mr Adams said: 'This attack comes in the middle of a stalemate. I would ask now for John Major to end the stalemate. There are causes of conflict; the conflict is ongoing. Every so often there will be something spectacular to remind the outside world.' Mr Adams' remarks came as an off-duty RUC officer was shot dead last night in Belfast. Ministers earlier mounted a joint effort to demonstrate they will not be knocked off course in attempts to reach a political settlement in the province. Mr Major and Mr Albert Reynolds, his Irish counterpart, claimed that the IRA's latest action and the failure of Sinn Fein to react positively to the Downing Street declaration would not deter London and Dublin from pressing on. At Westminster, Mr Major told MPs the 'unjustifiable' IRA attack would make 'no difference whatsoever' to the search for peace. He said the declaration set out 'a series of principles upon which we hope and intend to try and build a permanent peace in Northern Ireland'. In the Dail, Mr Reynolds attacked the IRA action as 'criminal and politically naive'. But both London and Dublin privately accept that the political momentum which followed December's declaration has largely been lost. They are resigned to an extended and highly problematical process aimed at establishing a framework for progress involving the province's constitutional parties. Speaking after yesterday's Anglo-Irish conference in London, Sir Patrick said the first Heathrow attack had shown that the IRA could not make its case democratically and had again resorted to force. Sir Patrick stressed that both governments were committed to continuing the so-called three-stranded political talks process and added: 'There is no limit to our patience because there is no limit to the advantages that success in that process will bring'. He emphasised, however, that the prize of prosperity and peace might lie 'at the end of a very long road but a road on which neither government is going to weary of travelling'. Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, in one of the most downbeat assessments from Dublin on the chances of an end to IRA action, said that 'the credit is running very low, if not totally expired' on the part of those who had yet to make up their mind on the Downing Street declaration. Mr Seamus Mallon, deputy leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party, dismissed the bilateral talks in the province as 'a stopgap' that did not go to the heart of the problem. Mr John Taylor, Ulster Unionist MP, came near to calling for the three-stranded approach to be abandoned. Security probe, Page 7 Editorial Comment, Page 17   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Sir Hal Miller, a former MP, told the Scott inquiry into the arms-for-Iraq affair that Sir Patrick had tried to dissuade him from giving evidence in support of a businessman accused of illegally exporting parts for the gun. But Sir Patrick, now Northern Ireland secretary, last night issued a statement of denial, saying he would be glad to give evidence to the inquiry. Sir Hal said he had approached Sir Patrick soon after Mr Peter Mitchell, managing director of Walter Somers, a west Midlands company, had been charged with export offences linked to the gun. Sir Hal had been prepared to produce records of conversations with an intelligence officer and government officials. He said he had met Sir Patrick in the House of Commons lobby. 'I was seriously concerned about these people (Walter Somers). They had done nothing wrong and were going to jail.' Sir Hal said that when he said he would defend Mr Mitchell in court if necessary, Sir Patrick had said: 'You wouldn't do that, would you?' He had replied: 'Just watch me.' But Sir Patrick's statement said: 'I have never urged Sir Hal Miller or anyone else to withhold evidence which would advantage a defendant.' He added that in November 1990 he had advised Customs and Excise to drop a prosecution in the Supergun case. 'This was a Customs prosecution for which neither I nor anyone for whom I had ministerial responsibility had had any part in its preparation.' Charges against Mr Mitchell were dropped after government law officers advised there was less than a 50 per cent chance of conviction. Sir Hal also said yesterday that British intelligence had briefed witnesses, including businessmen, on what they could tell a parliamentary Supergun inquiry last year. Later Mr Jim Cousins, a Labour MP and former trade and industry committee member, attempted to raise Sir Hal's remarks on the floor of the Commons but was interrupted by Miss Betty Boothroyd, the Speaker. She said the matter might involve a contempt of the House. Mr Cousins is expected to write to Miss Boothroyd arguing that, if Sir Hal is correct, it would appear that government departments and at least one minister deliberately deceived a Commons committee. Sir Hal, speaking after giving his evidence yesterday, said he did not think Lady Thatcher, the former prime minister, was linked to the Supergun affair. 'I'm a Conservative. I believe in the cock-up theory,' he added. The Scott inquiry will resume public hearings on June 11.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.     IQZ  Iraq, Middle East.

The peace process was expected to bring greater mobility and more religious mixing in private housing areas.

Research by the University of Ulster found property and construction companies were also expecting housebuilding and sales to benefit. The peace process was expected to bring greater mobility and more religious mixing in private housing areas. A rise in cross-border economic activity is also predicted, with the Belfast-Dublin corridor likely to be the focus of development. However, local companies anticipate intense competition as companies from the rest of the UK move into the province. Mr Denis Rooney, head of the institution working party, said: 'Our report identifies tourism in particular as offering enormous potential for economic growth provided the right infrastructure is developed. That means new hotels and other facilities as well as communications services.'  The Financial Times   London Page 8  "
0,FT921-8883 ,"FT921-8883 _AN-CBNB3AFIFT 920214   FT  14 FEB 92 / Nervousness north of the border: Scotland's business community is worried about possible political upheaval      By JAMES BUXTON   The possibility of constitutional change after the British general election  -whether devolution or outright independence - is sending shivers through Scotland's business community. The unmistakeably urgent tones in which the possibility of political reform is being discussed suggest that proposals from the Scottish Nationalist party and the Labour party are being taken seriously for the first time by businessmen. Both parties have put it firmly on their agenda. The former endorses outright independence, the latter a devolved parliament with the power to raise some taxes. Even the Conservative party, faced with opinion polls that indicate most Scottish people favour independence, may have to consider some form of devolution if it is returned to power. 'Independence would be a disaster and a tax-raising assembly almost as bad, as it would take us well down the road to independence,' says Lord Weir, chairman of the Weir Group, the Glasgow-based engineering company. He fears the political uncertainty which would arise from a period of transition to a new system of government, and higher taxes. He believes Scottish-based companies which do not depend on the Scottish market might move their headquarters, probably to England, if they were taxed more heavily in a separate Scotland. Lord Weir's reaction is typical of the anxiety of businessmen about the consequences they fear for Scotland and for their companies if constitutional changes are enacted. Such radical political upheaval has crucial implications for how Scotland would be financed. Mr Ian Begg, an economist at Cambridge University and an expert on the Scottish economy, estimates that Scotland receives between 10.5 per cent and 11 per cent of all UK public spending but only provides between 8 and 8.25 per cent of UK tax revenues and duties. The resulting gap is estimated by most economists to be just under Pounds 4bn. Labour and the SNP have different proposals for filling this shortfall. Under Labour's plan, a Scottish parliament would receive all income tax and value-added tax raised in Scotland, and the gap would be made up with a grant from Westminster. In addition, Labour intends that a Scottish parliament would be able, as the party puts it in policy statements to 'vary' the rate of income tax in Scotland by up to 3p in the pound. Labour politicians believe that Scots would agree to pay higher taxes for greater services - such as better health, education and housing provision. A recent Mori poll gave support to this claim, showing that 49 per cent of respondents were willing to pay higher taxes compared with 43 per cent who opposed an increase. Under the SNP's independence proposal, the gap would be filled by oil revenues. The SNP argues that Scotland is entitled to 90 per cent of the oil and gas reserves in the North Sea. It says that although the tax revenues from the North Sea this year are likely to be only Pounds 1.2bn, increased production arising from new oil fields and higher oil prices could raise revenues to about Pounds 5bn in the last half of the 1990s. Opponents of independence say this strategy begs many questions. Much depends on where England and Scotland would agree to locate the line between their sectors of the North Sea. If the line of the land border between the two countries, which runs in a northeasterly direction up to Berwick-upon-Tweed, were projected into the North Sea, a big part of the oil and gas fields would end up in the English sector, and Scotland might have less than 70 per cent of the revenues. Oil revenues seem, however, to be an uncertain basis for filling Scotland's revenue gap, and are volatile, varying greatly from year to year depending on the oil price, production levels and tax write-offs by the oil companies. Mr Begg believes that even if Scotland obtained all North Sea oil, it would still have a substantial borrowing requirement because of the gap between tax revenues and expenditure. 'It would be laughed out of the financial markets,' he says, and higher taxes might be necessary. Nevertheless, an independent Scotland would have a reasonably well-balanced economy, not only with considerable oil and gas production but a relatively large, export-oriented manufacturing base and a big financial services industry. It might have a gross domestic product of about Pounds 55bn, putting it below Denmark and Norway in western Europe but above Greece, Portugal and Ireland. For businessmen bewildered by the speed with which the issue of independence has come to the fore, the main problem is making business decisions in an uncertain political climate. A senior executive of a Scottish company explains: 'We don't know what's going to happen in the election, the economic issues don't get discussed enough and the whole debate is conducted in a vacuum so that hard facts are never established.' The finance director of a quoted Scottish manufacturing company says he knows of two Scottish companies which have established subsidiaries in England through which to pay their Scottish workforce, as a precaution against the higher income tax which an Edinburgh parliament might impose on them. Mr Brian Stewart, chief executive of Scottish  Newcastle, the drinks and leisure group which operates in both England and Scotland, fears that independence or devolution may reduce the access of Scottish companies to the English market. The planned single European market is not regarded as an adequate solution either, because it will for many years be much less integrated than the UK market. That concern is shared by Mr Malcolm Murray, chief executive of Scottish Life, the life assurer. He says that even if there were no tax differential between an independent Scotland and England, there might be consumer resistance or even discrimination in England against buying life policies from a Scottish company. England is the biggest market for most of Scotland's life companies and banks. ""My personal preference is for the status quo, but that's not an option any more,' he says. For the companies that do support constitutional change, devolution is preferred to independence. One businessman running an engineering concern in Glasgow argues that Scottish business would receive a better hearing in a Scottish assembly than it does at Westminster, and that a Scottish assembly would be more likely to tackle the problems of the region's transport infrastructure. Other supporters of devolution argue that higher taxes would be an acceptable price to pay for improved services such as health and education. This is the view of Tom McGregor, an engineering consultant, who will soon launch an organisation of businesspeople called Scotland Says Yes] (to devolution). While the idea of devolution gathers some support, few senior members of the Scottish business community approve of outright independence. But there are some singular voices of support. Mr Robin Angus, an investment analyst with County Natwest Woodmac in Edinburgh, believes an independent Scotland could give its financial services industry favourable tax treatment, particularly for one of its specialities, investment trusts. Sir Iain Noble, who chairs the Edinburgh issuing house Noble  Co, and is a pillar of the Scottish establishment, says he would be content with either a Scottish parliament inside Britain but dealing direct with Brussels, or an independent Scotland within the EC. 'It is axiomatic,' Sir Iain says, 'that taxes in Scotland would be lower than those in England, otherwise there would be a brain drain and a flight of capital. We would establish the simplest company law in the EC, attract corporate head offices and thrive on our financial and legal services. Whether independence was a success would depend entirely on our ability to be entrepreneurial and innovative.'  ------------------------------------------------------------------ SCOTLAND'S SHARE OF THE UNION  ------------------------------------------------------------------ General government expenditure Pounds per head        1988-1989      1989-1990      1990-1991  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Scotland                2,748          2,957          3,196 England                 2,119          2,338          2,586 Wales                   2,847          2,680          2,964 Northern Ireland        3,540          3,714          3,842  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Total                   2,232          2,448          2,694  ------------------------------------------------------------------ GDP Pounds million          1989    (%)      1990    (%)  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Scotland              35,740   (8.3)   38,738   (8.2) England              368,035  (85.4)  402,207  (85.4) Wales                 18,306   (4.2)   20,053   (4.3) Northern Ireland       9,116   (2.1)    9,821   (2.1)  ------------------------------------------------------------------ UK                   438,774 (100.0)  477,747 (100.0)  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Population Million              1989    (%)      1990    (%)  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Scotland              5.1   (8.9)      5.1   (8.9) England              47.7  (83.3)     47.8  (83.3) Wales                 2.9   (5.0)      2.9   (5.0) Northern Ireland      1.6   (2.8)      1.6   (2.8)  ------------------------------------------------------------------ UK                   57.2 (100.0)     57.4 (100.0)  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Source: CSO, Treasury  ------------------------------------------------------------------  The Financial Times   London Page 13 Illustration (Omitted).

His remarks came ahead of tomorrow's meeting in Dublin of the first session of the Anglo-Irish intergovernmental conference since the two governments unveiled their joint peace initiative at the end of last year. The conference is likely to provide the opportunity for both governments to reaffirm their joint position on the peace initiative and to make clear that their demands for a cessation of violence remain a prerequisite to any progress on a settlement. Tomorrow will also see a Sinn Fein conference in Londonderry, called to give members another opportunity to express views on the peace proposals. The meeting will be addressed by Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president. With British ministers increasingly pessimistic about the prospects for a positive IRA response, Mr Reynolds continued to stress his optimism. He said: 'I am not privy to the internal debate that is going on. But there is clearly an intense debate. 'I have repeatedly made it clear since the declaration was signed that I did not expect an early response. We are trying to find a resolution to a centuries-old conflict. 'I am as hopeful as I was on the first day of the declaration. But time is needed, and there can be no artificial deadlines. We are trying to change direction, and take the gun out of Irish politics. I would still give it a fair chance of success.' He stressed that there had been no contact with Sinn Fein over the 'clarification' it had demanded before making a decision. Ulster police last night put the province on a firebomb alert amid fears that the IRA was about to strike against business and commercial property.   Countries:-  IEZ  Ireland, EC.

0,FT911-272 ,"FT911-272 _AN-BEMAUAC7FT 910513   FT  13 MAY 91 / Constructing defences against terrorist attacks: A company in County Londonderry that refuses to give in to IRA intimidation      By KIERAN COOKE   RESILIENT is a word often used to describe the people of Northern Ireland. In spite of all the killings and bombings of the past 20 years the province's population shows determination to carry on with normal life. Mr John Henry is an example. He runs one of Northern Ireland's biggest construction companies, in Magherafelt, County Londonderry. It is much like any other large builder's yard, bustling with trucks, but the security checks, the vehicles in the company car park with bullet-proof windows and the surveillance cameras tell a different story. Mr Henry's privately run Henry Bros is the main company in Northern Ireland carrying out construction work for the security forces - the army and the Royal Ulster Constabulary. It is a very risky business. The IRA describes those who carry out such work as 'legitimate targets'. Mr Henry says: 'The IRA always comes for us. Unlike other companies, we see no reason to hide what we do.' The price for such openness has been high. In the past four years alone several people who were associated with the company, including Mr Henry's brother, have been murdered by the IRA. Company drivers have been shot at and the Henry Bros premises have been attacked with car bombs and mortars. In 1986 a manager at the Magherafelt plant was shot by the IRA as he sat in his car. The IRA had mistaken him for Mr Henry. Eighteen months ago a supplier to the company - a cousin of Mr Henry's wife  -was blown up in his car. Earlier this year the IRA abducted a company employee and forced him to drive a 'proxy bomb' to a nearby army base. The employee was lucky enough to escape before the massive bomb exploded. Mr Henry and many of his employees endure a besieged existence. Mr Henry is under constant police guard and he drives an armour-plated car. His company yard and his house are kept under constant surveillance. A quietly spoken, genial man, Mr Henry feels the pressure. 'It's when I go to Scotland or away somewhere that I realise just what it's like to relax. Here you can't let down your guard for one second.' Mr Henry, a Protestant, started his company in the mid 1970s. He was once in partnership with two Roman Catholics, but they sold out after IRA intimidation. Most of Mr Henry's 600 employees are Protestant. He says IRA intimidation prevents Catholics from joining the company. There have been times when Mr Henry has felt like giving up. One of his murdered brother's sons became involved with Protestant paramilitaries and is now serving a 12-year jail sentence. Last year one of Mr Henry's own sons was killed in an industrial accident. 'My family urge me to carry on. We have lost family members and employees, but we are also in the business of saving lives,' he says. Henry Bros builds and installs heavily reinforced steel and concrete structures to protect police stations and army posts, as well as bullet-proof windows and blast-proof doors for government offices and residences of senior officials. The company does much of its own research and collaborates with a company in Germany which specialises in counter terrorism and security. Army observation posts, called 'sangers', are built at the Magherafelt plant. The walls of the sangers consist of two layers of inch-thick steel sandwiching slabs of concrete. 'You always have to think about what the IRA will come up with next,' says Mr Henry. 'Now they are using horizontally launched mortars which can even pierce one of these sangers.' Henry Bros' business involves high risk, but it is also profitable. Five years ago company turnover was Pounds 5m. Last year it was Pounds 22m. The company has been forced into being as self-sufficient as possible. Three years ago the IRA sent cards to 30 of Henry Bros' leading suppliers, saying that if they continued selling goods to the company, funerals would follow. 'It had great effect. All our big suppliers refused to do business with us. We felt betrayed. We even had to start buying cement from Poland instead of locally,' Mr Henry says. 'If all the energy and skills we put into this business could instead be concentrated on exports, Northern Ireland could achieve a great deal,' he points out. Henry Bros is hoping for export orders - for its bullet-proof windows.  The Financial Times   London Page 9 Photograph Business as usual, searches are an everyday affair in Ulster (Omitted).  "

Scotland Yard said last night that the letter he wrote to the attorney-general on behalf of Mr Asil Nadir, which complained about the behaviour of two British police officers while in northern Cyprus, was based on misinformation. The officers whose alleged behaviour prompted Mr Mates's intervention, Mr Jones and Mr Savin, were in northern Cyprus on business unconnected with Asil Nadir or Polly Peck. In a detailed statement, which added to doubts over many of the claims from Mr Nadir, Scotland Yard said the two officers had been together in northern Cyprus only once, on October 9 1991, in connection with the deportation of a Turkish Cypriot, Mr Surmeli Tuluco. Mr Jones made a further visit to the island on November 5 1992 with another, unnamed officer, while Mr Savin visited on November 11, again with a second officer. Both visits were connected with different deportations. Separately, the Serious Fraud Office, which has been investigating Mr Nadir's business affairs with officers seconded from the Metropolitan fraud squad, said that 'none of them have ever been to northern Cyprus'. Mr Mates's letter was sent to the attorney-general on March 17 1993 with a photocopy of a certificate allegedly issued by the acting commissioner of police in northern Cyprus, giving dates of arrival and departure of Mr Jones and Mr Savin. The letter alleges both men stayed at the Altin Kaya Hotel, where they made extensive inquiries of the proprietor, Mr Fahri Otcuoglu. Mr Otcuoglu said he remembered two visits by Mr Jones and Mr Savin: one at the end of September 1991, when they stayed for three days, the other at the end of May 1992, when they stayed for five or six days. His hotel, a small bungalow on the outskirts of Kyrenia, was unable to provide any registration book or other documentation to confirm this. But the acting police commissioner for northern Cyprus, Mr Ali Cetin Karahan, said yesterday he had no recollection of either a Mr Jones or a Mr Savin coming to the island. One of the hotel's barmen, an Englishman who asked not to be named, said he recalled a visit by Mr Jones and Mr Savin, but insisted the two men had been there on deportation duties. Just how Mr Mates's letter came to be published remained a mystery last night. Mr Anthony Scrivener QC, the lawyer acting for Mr Nadir in the UK, said he had no knowledge of the letter prior to its publication. The only reference he had to SFO investigations in northern Cyprus was correspondence from the SFO stating they could not send their officers there because of legal difficulties with the local authorities. The events culminating in Mr Mates's resignation began on May 4 when Mr Nadir became a fugitive from British justice by jumping bail and flying to northern Cyprus, which the UK does not recognise as a legal entity. Within four weeks Mr Mates found himself in the midst of a growing political storm linked to the Nadir case when it was revealed by two Sunday newspapers that over a period of 18 months the minister had written to the attorney-general on Mr Nadir's behalf, questioning the conduct of the Serious Fraud Office's inquiry into the Polly Peck empire. It was also reported that three days before Nadir jumped bail, Mr Mates sent him a watch with the inscription 'From C and M. Don't let the buggers get you down.'

Answering questions in the Dail (Irish parliament) yesterday he quoted from the recent joint statement by Mr John Hume, the leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party, and Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein leader. He said: 'It is pretty clear that it is a peace process we are talking about . . . we are engaged in trying to find a formula for peace.' On the talks between Mr Hume and Mr Adams, Mr Reynolds said: 'I was fully aware of the objectives of those talks but not of the detail.' He and Mr Dick Spring, the foreign minister, are to be told those details in a full briefing from Mr Hume later today, and will consider the proposals that Mr Hume and Mr Adams have come up with. Mr Reynolds said loyalist paramilitaries in the province have declared their violence to be reactive to that of the IRA, and that if the IRA stops its campaign then the loyalists would stop theirs. Mr Hume and Mr Adams have been holding bilateral talks since last April, which Mr Hume has stated are aimed at achieving a 'total cessation of all violence'. Mr Reynolds attempted to damp expectations that there would be a prompt publication of the proposals. He said: 'I want to ask for restraint and patience from this house and the public in general. There is no overnight solution . . . I don't think that making every detail public would be helpful to achieving a settlement.' He has a meeting scheduled with Mr John Major, the British prime minister, before the end of the year, and added: 'If a further meeting becomes necessary before then, then I shall seek one.' The Northern Ireland Office had not fully digested the detail of Mr Reynolds' statements last night, but a spokesman said: 'The way forward as we see it is to get the (round-table) talks going again, and if any document is presented to us by the Irish government then we will consider it.' Pressed by opposition leaders as to whether the Irish government is prepared to amend its constitutional claim to Northern Ireland, which Unionists say is the main impediment to any progress, Mr Reynolds insisted that there will be no unilateral move by Dublin.

Instead they expect to concentrate on highlighting what they see as the government's solid record of achievement since the last general election and to unveil a handful of detailed policy proposals in areas such as social security, law and order and possibly education. Cabinet ministers yesterday agreed on this approach at a 20-minute meeting in spite of signs of mounting backbench concern about the danger posed by Mr Blair. Party officials believe better results can be achieved by contrasting this image of business-like Conservative government with what they see as Labour's vapid idealism. They feel the government has much to be proud of in its handling of areas such as Northern Ireland, crime prevention and the economy. They acknowledge however that the recovery has yet to produce a 'feelgood factor' among voters, many of whom have become worse off since 1992 because of tax increases. It is safe to assume, however, that Mr Blair's embarrassing defeat yesterday over Labour's commitment to widespread public ownership will not pass entirely unmentioned. This insight into Tory conference planning emerged as Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, attempted to steady party nerves by saying it was 'in the grasp of the Conservative party to win the election quite comfortably when it comes'. Mr Clarke said the party would use next week's conference to 'carry on with the momentum of successful change we have made in this country.' With Europe less high on the political agenda than in recent years and Mr John Major having to some extent reasserted his grip, Northern Ireland might emerge as one of the week's principal talking-points. In spite of a general perception that the prime minister has handled the issue well, the party's vocal and influential integrationist camp is likely to demand reassurance about the direction of government policy.

Marking an apparent Government change of tone about the  prospects of hard-line Irish republican acceptance of the joint  Anglo-Irish statement, he spoke of ""a rational ground"" for hope  about the Provisionals' reaction. ""We believe we may yet see a  positive response from the provisionals,"" he said. ""Of course,  there is a rational ground for hope, because it is so much the  will of and demand of the people of this island, north and  south, that after all the declaration calls for nothing to be  given up by anybody -- apart from violence.    ""It simply says that constitutional principles shall be  based  upon consent and agreement, and nobody is excluded from that  process, save and except those who hope to bring a bomb or a  bullet to fortify their arguments.""    Pressure on Sinn Fein mounted today when the U.S. government  effectively refused party president Gerry Adams a visa to visit  a New York conference.    A statement in Washington said the White House would only  consider his application if he publicly renounced violence and  threw his support behind the Downing Street peace declaration.    At the same time, the first of four Sinn Fein ""peace  commission"" hearings to gauge reaction to the London-Dublin  statement within the republican movement was being held in  Londonderry.    Sir Patrick -- speaking after a meeting in Dublin of the  Anglo-Irish intergovernmental Northern Ireland Conference --  also appeared to offer greater scope than before for  clarification for the republicans of the December 15 document  signed by Prime Minister John Major and his Irish counterpart  Albert Reynolds.    ""I am not aware of any particular part of the document that  we have been asked to clarify,"" he said. ""I am not inviting a  request for clarification, but it so happens that nobody has  said `Look, we don't understand paragraph three,' which is quite  interesting.""    Sir Patrick claimed that a letter sent by Mr Adams to Mr  Major amounted to a request for negotiation rather than  clarification. He emphasised: ""We will continue to make clear  what the document does and does not do. We continue to make  speeches that do just that. I do not believe there is anything  between the two governments on this and I certainly don't wish  to see anybody under any genuine misapprehension as to what the  declaration says. What I am not prepared to do is to negotiate.  I am not prepared to unravel something that has taken as long  as this has to put together, and which is very clear and  comprehensive. I will not gloss it and say it means something  it does not say.""    The conference meeting, initially set to end early this  afternoon, went on for more than six hours.    In a joint statement afterwards, Sir Patrick and joint  chairman Dick Spring, Ireland's deputy premier and foreign  minister, condemned recent violence in Ulster, and said a range  of issues had been reviewed.    Sir Patrick relayed British disappointment at the Irish  government's recent decision to scrap a 20-year-old ban on  broadcasting interviews with members of the IRA, Sinn Fein and  other groups with paramilitary links. A similar ban continues  to operate in the United Kingdom.    Both Sir Patrick and Mr Spring appeared to rule out setting  a  deadline for the IRA and Sinn Fein response to the Downing  Street declaration after today's talks.    The Ulster Secretary said: ""There is no talk of deadlines.  The principles are not going to cease to apply come the end of  month one, two, three or five."" And Irish Foreign Minister Mr  Spring added: ""What we are trying to do is of such importance  that a deadline would not help.""     "

John Major told 1,000 businessmen in New York: ""What we are  working for is nothing less than the reskilling of Britain for  the 21st century.""    He used a key speech to the British-American Chamber of  Commerce to stress that the UK was emerging from recession  faster and more strongly than any other leading country in  Europe.    During the address, the culmination of Mr. Major's three-day  trip to the US, he also:     -  Pledged to go ahead with the  ""three strand"" talks on Northern Ireland, despite the rebuff he  has suffered from the Ulster Unionists;    -  Announced he hoped the  GATT world trade deal could be implemented on January 1, 1995 --  six months ahead of the original plan.    Mr. Major said: ""Britain has changed out of all recognition  in the past 15 years and is changing again in the 1990s.""    He told his audience: ""Like you, we have just come through a  recession. It was painful, but we have come out stronger than  before.    ``This past year, Britain's economy has been growing twice  as  fast as forecast. And this coming year we are again expecting  the fastest growth rate among main European countries.''    However, Mr. Major stressed that more change was needed for  Britain to sharpen its competitive edge.    ""That is why we are embarked on a fundamental review of all  the factors affecting our ability to succeed in the global  marketplace. Competitiveness is the key challenge for the 1990s  -- and it is one the British welcome.""    The Prime Minister pledged: ""What we are working for is  nothing less than the reskilling of Britain for the 21st  century.""    He said added that it was not just industry that must  innovate, but government as well.    ""The days of monolithic government are over. The governments  that will help their countries to be competitive will do less  but do it better. All our government departments have been told  to roll back the burden of regulation.    ``There is one British produce I want to see less of -- our  famous red tape.''    Mr. Major said Britain and America were now driving through  the historic GATT trade deal.    He and President Clinton had agreed they should set an early  target for tariff cuts to be implemented -- January 1, 1995 --  but other countries had to be consulted before this could become  a reality.    Mr. Major also stressed that Britain was the ideal base for  operations in Europe, saying: ""It is no accident that nearly 40  percent of all U.S. investment in Europe comes to Britain. We  intend to keep it that way.""    He claimed that much of Europe was over-regulated, something  which cost jobs and added to the burdens carried by employers.    On Bosnia, the Prime Minister said he and President Clinton  had agreed that Britain and the U.S. would take joint action to  build on the Sarajevo ceasefire.    ""We are sending a joint British-American planning mission to  see how we can help restore public utilities there.""    He said they both believed in firm action to enforce the  no-fly zone and that Britain was supporting the American-led  diplomatic initiative to seek agreement between Bosnia's Croats  and Muslims.    On Northern Ireland, the Prime Minister spoke of the  overwhelming support the Downing Street Declaration had  received, highlighting the BBC poll showing over 90 percent of  people throughout the island of Ireland wanted Sinn Fein to  renounce violence.    ""Yet they continue to hold back from the peace process and  perpetuate violence. There have been 17 attacks on the security  forces since the declaration.""    The Prime Minister said he hoped Sinn Fein could yet be  persuaded to change.    ""I believe that strong support for peace coming from America  can play a part in this. In the meantime, the British and Irish  Governments will continue to work with the constitutional  parties for a lasting political settlement.""     "

'I believe the opportunity should not be passed by,' Cardinal Daly said. 'It should not be rubbished.' Speaking less than 24 hours after the prime minister denounced the IRA's move as 'self-serving and cynical', the Primate of all Ireland said the ceasefire raised 'significant hope', although it was 'disappointingly short'. 'I am afraid, respectfully, I would not agree that this is a cynical exercise on the part of the IRA,' he added. 'The significance is that for the first time in 20 years they have initiated this cessation of violence. Why not test it?' As the leaders of the three main opposition parties in the Irish republic issued a joint peace demand to the IRA, Archbishop Robin Eames, the Protestant Primate of the Church of Ireland, responded to the ceasefire in a more downbeat vein. Although any cessation was to be welcomed, he said: 'The real Christian agenda for Northern Ireland must be written by those who see that a complete end to violence . . . will give us the opportunity to plan the way forward in peace and justice.' Yesterday's developments came as the British and Irish governments reaffirmed that the ceasefire, starting at midnight on Tuesday, falls far short of the permanent cessation required to admit Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, to round-table talks. Sinn Fein has called for 'immediate and direct talks' with the British government to obtain clarification of the Downing Street declaration signed by London and Dublin last December. Dublin has expressed 'extreme disappointment' with the IRA's response to the declaration, with Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, urging Sinn Fein to spell out what it means by its latest clarification demand. Underlining Dublin's growing exasperation with Sinn Fein, Mr Reynolds has departed for a week-long holiday in Cyprus. Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, has said he 'would not seek to protract' any talks with the British government and emphasised that Sinn Fein is not seek-ing negotiation, only clarification.

0,FT944-14853 ,"FT944-14853 _AN-EJUCOAASFT 941021   FT  21 OCT 94 / Basque poll may allow Eta to follow IRA      By TOM BURNS      BILBAO   The Northern Ireland peace process could have a knock-on effect on Spain's Basque Country where regional elections on Sunday are widely viewed as setting the stage for similar negotiations to end violence by Eta, the separatist organisation. The vote among the 2.1m Basques, who since 1979 have enjoyed increasing home rule, is also seen as a watershed poll that could undermine the nationalist rhetoric and extremist calls for secession from Spain that has dominated much of local politics. Opinion polls indicate that the Partido Nacionalista Vasco, PNV, the mainstream nationalist party, will remain the dominant force but that there will be big gains by Madrid-based parties - the conservative People's party (PP) and the communist coalition, Izquierda Unida (IU) - which had formerly been on the sidelines of Basque politics. 'I believe that once the elections are over,' says Jon Idigoras, a veteran leader of Herri Batasuna (HB), the radical Basque group that acts as Eta's political front organisation, 'there will be contacts with Eta and any one of us in HB can play the role of Gerry Adams (the leader of Ireland's Sinn Fein who was at the centre of the IRA's ceasefire).' Founded in the late 1960s, Eta has been responsible for more than 600 deaths in its campaign to create an independent Basque state and some 500 of its members are in Spanish and French prisons. 'We have still got to digest the Irish developments,' says Mr Idigoras, 'but it is clear that they will force every-one, the Spanish government, the Basque political parties and Eta to move their pawns.' The sentiment is echoed by the PNV's Mr Jose Antonio Ardanza, who is certain to be returned as Basque prime minister on Sunday. Mr Ardanza has said during the electoral meetings that he favours 'discreet and, if possible, secret' talks with Eta. Mr Xabier Arzalluz, the powerful chairman of the PNV and its leading ideologue for the past 20 years, says he expects a 'deep rethink' by HB after Sunday's vote, particularly if the opinion polls are borne out and the radicals, which are at present the third-largest political group in the Basque Country after the PNV and the Socialists, lose votes. Although there are important differences between the politics of Northern Ireland and those of the Basque Country, Mr Arzalluz says HB's supporters have been 'stunned by the IRA's decision to give up violence, apparently in return for nothing'. The momentum towards a Basque peace process will, however, depend on the willingness of the Socialist government in Madrid to sanction the talks that the PNV has in mind. While the Madrid government officially opposes contacts with Eta, Mr Mario Onaindia, a former Eta member and now a leading Socialist party official in the Basque Country, says circumstances after the election will favour 'a dialogue'. Sunday's vote is, however, expected to see a decline in support for the Socialist party which has been the junior partner in the Basque Country's government for the past eight years. The shrinking Socialist vote is partly prompted by the diminished popularity of Mr Felipe Gonzalez's government in Madrid, but it could also reflect dissatisfaction among rank-and-file socialists, mostly blue-collar migrant workers from elsewhere in Spain, over the local party's decision to co-opt a minority left-wing group led by Mr Onaindia and to compete for the 'ethnic' Basque vote. Polls suggest that the IU coalition could be backed on Sunday by former socialist supporters and, underlining a further shift from nationalist-based politics, that the conservative PP will do well among young professionals. 'People are at last waking up,' says Mr Jaime Mayor Oreja, the leader of the PP in the Basque Country. 'The permanent vindication of the Basque nation over the past years has only created uncertainties and impoverished the Basque Country,' he says.   Countries:-  ESZ  Spain, EC.

0," LA031790-0147   191594    March 17, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition      Orange County Life; Part N; Page 1; Column 4      2599 words      PUB, NETWORK OF COUNTRYMEN MAKE U.S. LIFE A WEE BIT BETTER      By MARESA ARCHER and RICK VANDERKNYFF      Gerry Mackey is sitting at the door of his Costa Mesa pub, the Harp Inn, where  he greets -- by name -- each person who enters.    Inside, the pub is noisy, but not from loud music or even the wide-screen TV in  the corner, where a Boston Celtics basketball game plays silently. The lively  din comes from the customers -- laughing, telling stories, trading jokes.    ""The art of conversation is one of the greatest things we have to offer,"" says  Mackey, stroking his graying beard. ""Everybody knows everybody, which is rare  for bars in Southern California.""    Plenty of bars put a shamrock or a leprechaun on the sign and call themselves  Irish, but only a handful actually resemble a real Irish pub. Back home, the  pub is a social center, not just a place to drink.    ""Our pub could, to a certain extent, be any little village pub in Ireland,""  says Mackey, and the clientele seems to bear out his boast. Irish brogues are  everywhere, and the regulars include everyone from Irish-Americans several  generations removed from their roots to new immigrants right off the plane.    For Orange County's Irish, scattered over the suburban landscape, such spots as  the Harp and the newer International Pub and Platter in Newport Beach provide a  cultural touchstone, a place to share a common heritage for a people who  cherish community values.    ""There's a lot of Irish in Southern California,"" says Mackey, ""but it's so  spread out, it's difficult to get together in any sort of numbers.""    In the 1980 census, the most recent local statistics available, 67,802 people  in Orange County listed Irish as their single ancestry, while almost 300,000  more said they were at least partly Irish. With no cohesive communities like  those in such cities as Boston, New York and Chicago, Orange County's Irish  community has been, until recent years, sprawling and largely assimilated.    But since the early '80s, the local Irish community has been infused with a  shot of new blood, as many young Irish have fled a stagnant economy that offers  few job opportunities. The official unemployment rate in the Republic of  Ireland has topped 20%, with the jobless rate for workers under 25 roughly  twice that.    So Ireland has lost a young, highly educated generation that has left the  island nation's fabled green for the green of better job prospects abroad. Many  have come to the United States, and while a good percentage settled in Irish  communities in the East and Midwest, others have been enticed West by sunshine  and a healthy economy. Some of them arrived legally, others not.    Since 1982, about 35,000 Irish have emigrated legally to the United States,  while about 40,000 more have overstayed their tourist visas and stayed  illegally to work and live, according to figures provided by the Irish  Consulate in San Francisco. All told, more than 175,000 have left the country  in the last decade.    Best guesses within Orange County's Irish community are that several thousand  illegal Irish make their homes here.    While most recent immigrants are from the Republic of Ireland, others have come  from Northern Ireland. Though that country, part of the United Kingdom, is torn  by political and religious unrest, recently arrived Northern Ireland nationals  interviewed for this article say they came for jobs, just as their brethren to  the south.    Together, they form an almost invisible network -- the women working largely as  live-in domestic help, the men in construction.    Conor (not his real name) is one who came to Huntington Beach. He decided it  was time to leave his County Meath home in the Republic of Ireland nearly five  years ago, after placing number 2,400 out of more than 4,000 who took a civil  service exam.    The number of job openings? Six.    ""The early '80s were a bad time for Ireland,"" Conor said. About two-thirds of  those with whom he graduated left the country, he said.    Like many Irish men here illegally, Conor works in construction. He started in  New York City, but headed west with a friend when the cold and grime became too  much. Many of the illegal Irish, Conor said, hold college degrees, but cannot  hope to land better-paying jobs because of their undocumented status.    ""There are people here, well-educated, that are wasting their careers in  construction because they're not legal and can't get the jobs they're trained  for,"" Conor said.    ""I got in the habit of being sneaky,"" confessed Niaiamh Smythe, who came to  Southern California on a tourist visa, planning to stay just three months  before returning to college in Ireland.    ""I was going to school from 7 in the morning to 10 at night, and when summer  came -- and summer in Ireland isn't very summery -- I said, 'OK, I'll go to  California and get skinny and tan and come back in fall,' "" Smythe said. ""That  was 4 1/2 years ago.""    Being an undocumented alien did not keep her from getting a job with a jeweler  as a diamond appraiser, work she had done back home. But then the new  immigration law passed in 1986, requiring employers to get proof of legal  status from employees. Too embarrassed to tell her employers she was here  illegally, Smythe told them she had been called back home because her mother  had been in an accident.    She has since started the paper work to become legal. When she started, she was  told all she needed was $2,000 and a sponsor, but so far the process has taken  three years and cost $3,500. She still does not have her green card, but she  does have a labor certificate to allow her to work while she continues the  process.    Smythe and most other Irish illegals didn't qualify for the amnesty program  because they hadn't been in the country long enough.    Obtaining legal status requires a sponsor, a job and enough money to pay a  lawyer to get through the Immigration and Naturalization Service red tape. Once  an application has been approved, the applicant must go through interviews at  the American Embassy in the country of origin. For Smythe, that means flying  back to Dublin once she is given notice to appear.    In the meantime, Smythe is working as a nanny in Long Beach and studying at the  university there for a music and drama degree.    Margaret (not her real name), 26, is also a Dubliner and a nanny for a  Huntington Beach family. She has been here four years and has applied for a  Donnelly visa, a special visa for west Europeans dispensed by lottery. But she  does not have a lawyer or any plans to hire one.    She said she is in no hurry because she is so attached to the family for which  she works. She is paid $250 a week, plus gas money for her car and all her  phone bills and room and board. She has two charges, a teen-age boy and a  5-year-old girl. The girl attends school in the morning and Margaret is free to  go her own way.    Although she is happy with her present situation, that was not the case with  the family that flew her from Ireland.    ""A lot of them just look for slave labor -- they don't care if you don't have a  green card,"" Margaret said. ""When I first came I made $90 a week plus room and  board, but they wanted someone to cook their meals and clean (the house) and  watch the kids.""    Helping young Irish women who have come over as nannies is a job Monica Keogh  has been doing for years. As founding president of the Orange County chapter of  the Ancient Order of Hibernian, she has aided young women in finding jobs and  networking with other Irish in the county.    The order, she said, was founded in the 1800s ""for the protection of priests  and domestics at a time when the Irish were facing great discrimination in this  country,"" Keogh said.    She and her husband, John, came to California more than 30 years ago from their  native Ireland when John was transfered by the aerospace firm where he worked.  They moved from Northern California to Huntington Beach eight years ago.    Though she never had to face being an illegal immigrant, Keogh said she  understands the difficulties of being an undocumented worker from the young  women she has met over the years.    ""To be young and illegal is terrible. Their life style does not allow them to  flourish,"" she said with a sigh. She has many tales of young Irish who have  been victimized because of their illegal status.    ""I've heard of young men starting painting businesses and then not being paid  when the job is done because the contractor found they were illegal,"" Keogh  said. Some girls she knows ""after five years are being paid $80 a week and  giving money to their employers for a lawyer, and still don't have a green  card,"" she said.    All in all, though, Orange County's financial and recreational opportunities  are enough to keep Conor and others working here -- at least for the time  being. But all the undocumented Irish interviewed for this story talk of  returning home someday.    ""I'll probably stay in the States awhile. It's a great place to spend your  20s,"" Conor said. ""But when you're thinking of settling down, Ireland's a  better country for raising your kids. That sounds terrible -- what I mean is,  you always want your kids to be reared the same way you were reared,"" he said.    Living here but planning to return home someday can keep some of the Irish from  getting into serious relationships with Americans. One woman said she was  engaged to an American for a time, but the differences in culture put a strain  on them and the relationship ended.    What are the differences? Most of the Irish interviewed, used to the tight  social fabric of friends and neighbors back home, said they felt Americans were  less sincere in their relationships.    ""Here couples get married and the first sign of frustration they get a  divorce,"" Conor said. Divorce is still illegal in Ireland after a recent ballot  measure to legalize it failed.    Another Irishman said Californians take friendship too lightly.    ""They're your friend this week, in a month they move on,"" he said. ""Back home  you know you can count on a friend to stand by you in a rough time.""    Feelings of isolation are not confined to undocumented Irish, but are shared by  many of the newly arrived who come legally.    ""Particularly in Ireland, the sense of community, the attachment, are much  stronger than you would find here,"" said Cairen Murtagh of Newport Beach. His  wife, Deirdre, agreed: ""One is far more anonymous here.""    On the surface, the Murtaghs would seem a shining immigrant success story. A  scant 14 months after arriving from Ireland, the couple enjoy well-paying jobs  in their chosen fields -- he as a research chemist, she as a financial analyst  -- and make their home in an upscale Newport Beach condominium within sight of  the Pacific.    Still, memories of the life left behind have proved hard to shake. Once, the  Murtaghs talked about applying for U.S. citizenship after the minimum five  years; now, they believe they might return home one day.    ""It would be foolish to view Ireland with totally rose-colored glasses,""  allowed Deirdre, 32. But, she said, ""It seems most people we talk to talk about  going back.""    Although the economy in the Republic of Ireland has stabilized somewhat, jobs  there remain scarce. Many Irish in Orange County plan to stay at least for a  time and are doing their best to adjust.    The Murtaghs are helping to create an Irish Network in Southern California,  patterned after one in the San Francisco Bay Area. The organization, with 120  members so far (about 20 of them in Orange County), publishes a membership  directory and organizes events. A recent talk drew more than 300 people.    ""It seems to be mostly of interest to the recently arrived,"" said Cairen  Murtagh, although he estimates about 25% of the group's members are  Irish-Americans. The network, which provides a chance to make both business and  social contacts, is an attempt to create an Irish sense of community in  fast-paced Southern California.    ""It's working out that way,"" Murtagh, 39, said. ""Our social life has picked up  considerably.""    Leonore Coyne is an Irish-American who has come up with her own way to bring  the community together. She put together a two-day Irish fair, held earlier  this month in Laguna Beach, with authentic food, entertainment and contests.  The event raised money for Straight Ahead Inc., a residential drug abuse  program in Dana Point.    ""I wanted to bring back the times when I was very young,"" Coyne explained. Her  father was an Irishman, and when Leonore was a youngster in Los Angeles, ""every  week he would bring me and my brother to these Irish dances at places that  aren't even there any more.""    The Brothers of St. Patrick Novitiate in Midway City has become one network for  the Irish in Orange County. Brother Edwin Guidera, himself an Irishman, is  active in trying to establish an Irish youth center along with Keogh.    One of the reasons the novitiate has attracted the Irish is through the Irish  soccer leagues that play their games on the brothers' field.    ""We let them use the field in exchange for fund-raising support,"" said Brother  Edwin, as he is most often called.    Because the novitiate has become a meeting place for the Irish, Brother Edwin  has organized events specifically for them. To mark St. Patrick's Day, Sunday's  Mass will be said in Gaelic -- complete with a locally based Gaelic choir --  and a celebration will follow.    But perhaps the biggest social centers for local Irish remain the pubs --  especially the Harp Inn. The Costa Mesa pub offers live Irish entertainment  three nights a week, along with lessons in Irish dancing and Gaelic, and  sponsors several sports teams: Irish and English soccer, hurling and Gaelic  football.    Videos of soccer games from back home are played on the pub's televisions, as  are Irish newscasts broadcast weekly by a Los Angeles television station. Some  American sports are popular too -- especially Notre Dame football. The Harp has  darts and Guiness beer on tap -- it doesn't have pool tables, video games or a  jukebox.    And though the conversation flows, two topics stay largely off-limits:  ""Politics and religion are things that we don't discuss,"" says Mackey. While  people keep informed on the situation in Northern Ireland, they keep their  opinions on the matter -- and any affiliations to the combatants -- to  themselves, according to Mackey.    ""It's kind of a unique place in Orange County. It's not a yuppie bar,"" says  Greg Kelley, an Irish-American who convenes local meetings of a Notre Dame  alumni club at the Harp. ""It's just a friendly Irish pub.""    Denis Murray and Terry McCarten are the Mulligans, an Irish music duo that has  played pubs throughout Southern California for 10 years. The Mulligans also  have some rock songs in their repertory, but can leave those aside when they  play the Harp every Friday night.    ""You know you have a real crowd when they just want the Irish stuff,"" McCarten  said. ""We get a great response from the crowd here.""    Set next to an industrial park behind Newport Boulevard, the Harp is easy to  miss. But its reputation hasn't suffered -- it has even been written up in a  small-town Irish newspaper.    ""For some reason or another, they're pretty quick to find it,"" owner Mackey  said of his customers. Though the Harp is just 2 years old, a number of  marriages have already come of meetings there.    Mackey, who first toured California as part of an Irish soccer team and fell in  love with the weather, moved here from County Armagh in Ireland 10 years ago.  ""It's a big culture shock coming to the U.S. for the first time,"" he said. The  Harp, he said, ""gives them a little bit of the old sod.""

His  wife, Deirdre, agreed: ""One is far more anonymous here.""    On the surface, the Murtaghs would seem a shining immigrant success story. A  scant 14 months after arriving from Ireland, the couple enjoy well-paying jobs  in their chosen fields -- he as a research chemist, she as a financial analyst  -- and make their home in an upscale Newport Beach condominium within sight of  the Pacific.    Still, memories of the life left behind have proved hard to shake. Once, the  Murtaghs talked about applying for U.S. citizenship after the minimum five  years; now, they believe they might return home one day.    ""It would be foolish to view Ireland with totally rose-colored glasses,""  allowed Deirdre, 32. But, she said, ""It seems most people we talk to talk about  going back.""    Although the economy in the Republic of Ireland has stabilized somewhat, jobs  there remain scarce. Many Irish in Orange County plan to stay at least for a  time and are doing their best to adjust.    The Murtaghs are helping to create an Irish Network in Southern California,  patterned after one in the San Francisco Bay Area. The organization, with 120  members so far (about 20 of them in Orange County), publishes a membership  directory and organizes events. A recent talk drew more than 300 people.    ""It seems to be mostly of interest to the recently arrived,"" said Cairen  Murtagh, although he estimates about 25% of the group's members are  Irish-Americans. The network, which provides a chance to make both business and  social contacts, is an attempt to create an Irish sense of community in  fast-paced Southern California.    ""It's working out that way,"" Murtagh, 39, said. ""Our social life has picked up  considerably.""    Leonore Coyne is an Irish-American who has come up with her own way to bring  the community together. She put together a two-day Irish fair, held earlier  this month in Laguna Beach, with authentic food, entertainment and contests.  The event raised money for Straight Ahead Inc., a residential drug abuse  program in Dana Point.    ""I wanted to bring back the times when I was very young,"" Coyne explained. Her  father was an Irishman, and when Leonore was a youngster in Los Angeles, ""every  week he would bring me and my brother to these Irish dances at places that  aren't even there any more.""    The Brothers of St. Patrick Novitiate in Midway City has become one network for  the Irish in Orange County. Brother Edwin Guidera, himself an Irishman, is  active in trying to establish an Irish youth center along with Keogh.    One of the reasons the novitiate has attracted the Irish is through the Irish  soccer leagues that play their games on the brothers' field.    ""We let them use the field in exchange for fund-raising support,"" said Brother  Edwin, as he is most often called.    Because the novitiate has become a meeting place for the Irish, Brother Edwin  has organized events specifically for them. To mark St. Patrick's Day, Sunday's  Mass will be said in Gaelic -- complete with a locally based Gaelic choir --  and a celebration will follow.    But perhaps the biggest social centers for local Irish remain the pubs --  especially the Harp Inn. The Costa Mesa pub offers live Irish entertainment  three nights a week, along with lessons in Irish dancing and Gaelic, and  sponsors several sports teams: Irish and English soccer, hurling and Gaelic  football.    Videos of soccer games from back home are played on the pub's televisions, as  are Irish newscasts broadcast weekly by a Los Angeles television station. Some  American sports are popular too -- especially Notre Dame football. The Harp has  darts and Guiness beer on tap -- it doesn't have pool tables, video games or a  jukebox.    And though the conversation flows, two topics stay largely off-limits:  ""Politics and religion are things that we don't discuss,"" says Mackey. While  people keep informed on the situation in Northern Ireland, they keep their  opinions on the matter -- and any affiliations to the combatants -- to  themselves, according to Mackey.    ""It's kind of a unique place in Orange County. It's not a yuppie bar,"" says  Greg Kelley, an Irish-American who convenes local meetings of a Notre Dame  alumni club at the Harp. ""It's just a friendly Irish pub.""    Denis Murray and Terry McCarten are the Mulligans, an Irish music duo that has  played pubs throughout Southern California for 10 years. The Mulligans also  have some rock songs in their repertory, but can leave those aside when they  play the Harp every Friday night.    ""You know you have a real crowd when they just want the Irish stuff,"" McCarten  said. ""We get a great response from the crowd here.""    Set next to an industrial park behind Newport Boulevard, the Harp is easy to  miss. But its reputation hasn't suffered -- it has even been written up in a  small-town Irish newspaper.    ""For some reason or another, they're pretty quick to find it,"" owner Mackey  said of his customers. Though the Harp is just 2 years old, a number of  marriages have already come of meetings there.    Mackey, who first toured California as part of an Irish soccer team and fell in  love with the weather, moved here from County Armagh in Ireland 10 years ago.  ""It's a big culture shock coming to the U.S. for the first time,"" he said. The  Harp, he said, ""gives them a little bit of the old sod.""

0,FT931-6419 ,"FT931-6419 _AN-DCBCFABOFT 930302   FT  02 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Irish misty eyed over Digital days / A look at the local impact of a shake-up in the world computer industry      By TIM COONE   THE decision last week by Digital Equipment, the US computer maker, to close its manufacturing facility at Galway in the west of Ireland has produced much dismay and soul-searching in Ireland. Digital has been in Ireland for 22 years, and was the biggest employer in the electronics sector until its decision to concentrate production at Ayr in Scotland, with the loss of 780 jobs at the Galway factory. The Irish government has blamed the British government for allegedly offering lucrative government contracts to Digital (although it admits to having no hard evidence). The opposition blames the government and the Industrial Development Authority for having done 'too little too late' to save the Galway factory. More nationalistic voices, including some in government, have been heard questioning the dominant role being played by multinationals in Ireland's industrial sector, and arguing that fewer tax and grant incentives should be given to foreign companies and greater support given to indigenous Irish industry. More sober reflection by those not so close to the political front line, though, view the Digital closure as part of an inevitable shake-out of an industry facing rapid technological change. Mr Edward Johnston, the director of the Federation of Electronic and Informatic Industries in Ireland, said: 'We have to live with the fact of occasional failures in terms of closures.' Digital's Galway plant was primarily manufacturing VAX minicomputers. In early 1992 it decided to start building its new Delta workstation around its newly developed Alpha chip. According to industry sources, test marketing of the Delta in Europe proved a failure, as PCs have increasingly come to dominate the market over workstations and minicomputers. As Digital had already begun PC manufacturing at Ayr, and had opened a new semiconductor plant in Scotland, the concentration of production at Ayr became inevitable. Next to the food processing industry, electronics is Ireland's most important manufacturing sector. Built up in just 25 years it now employs 17,000 people with a further 7,000 employed in software production and development. Net investment in fixed assets in the electronics sector amounts to IPounds 763m (Pounds 747m), which produces an annual output worth close to IPounds 5bn, of which 80 per cent is exported. In the early 1970s, jobs in the industry were mainly in the basic assembly of low-cost products. Today workers are involved in the production of high-value systems, components and software. According to the IDA, the government agency responsible for promoting inward investment into Ireland, as much as 40 per cent of the 9,000 jobs in the electronics sector in 1980 no longer exist. Nonetheless the sector has experienced continuous growth, with high-tech plants replacing the older assembly 'screwdriver plant' type operations, and demanding better trained employees. The past year has been one of even greater change. Last year, Wang, which went into receivership, shed 75 per cent of its 700-strong workforce in Ireland. Apple was on the point of putting off 400 of their 800 workforce, but have since revised their decision. By the end of 1993, in the space of two years, about 10 per cent of the workforce in the existing electronics industry will have been made redundant as a result of the Wang and Digital wind-downs and the closures of several smaller companies. Nonetheless this is being offset by new entrants such as Dell and Intel, which are making major investments which within two years could boost the sector's output by as much as 25 per cent. Dell decided to set up its sole European manufacturing base Ireland just two years ago. According to Mr Buddy Griffin, the managing director for manufacturing, 'there has been no cause for pain or regrets. On the contrary the operation has been highly successful and facilitated very rapid growth in sales in the European market.' Intel is in the process of constructing a IPounds 500m semiconductor plant, the biggest electronics investment ever in Ireland. The plant will manufacture wafers for its new generation Pentium chip, otherwise known as the 586 processor, and will be the company's main world manufacturing facility for the processor, with sales projected at a level of 'billions of dollars'. Some 1,500 jobs in total will be created at the plant. Mr Frank Turpin, the external affairs manager at Intel, said the reasons for choosing Ireland for this strategic plant were primarily due to the workforce skills available and the 10 per cent corporation tax regime. 'Due to the complexity of the technology, we felt it had to be an English language location, and in Scotland we felt we would face poaching by other companies,' he said. Intel itself has poached 200 Irish engineers from other electronics companies worldwide. Mr Dan Flinter, the executive director for overseas industry at the IDA, is in no doubt that, despite the setback of Digital's closure, the electronics industry will continue to grow in Ireland. 'We shall continue to back strong companies that want to locate here. We are in the business of applying capital resources to get the best return, not necessarily the safest.' It is not the most comforting message for the 780 who are to lose their jobs at Galway, but as Mr Turpin said: 'There is a whole world of difference in the industry now compared to when Digital came to Ireland.'

Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, accused the Government  of making ""no attempt to bring us on board"" and said he wanted  Mr Major to abandon what he called the Unionist veto over future  moves towards a united Ireland.    There was now ""a standoff,"" he said. ""If the republican  struggle needs to continue for the next 25 years, then so be it.  We continue for the next 25 years.""    Nearly four weeks after the declaration was signed at  Downing  Street by Mr Major and Mr Albert Reynolds, Ireland's prime  minister, doubts remain over whether the IRA is prepared to give  up violence and enter the political process.    Mr Major, interviewed by Sir David Frost on BBC television  yesterday, said he was still prepared to wait for an answer, but  his patience was not inexhaustible. He also accused Sinn Fein of  trying to muddy the waters by seeking further clarification.    ""What at present is going on is that they are seeking to  muddy that issue, to enter into negotiations effectively without  giving up violence,"" Mr Major said.    ""Well that is not on offer. They do have to give up violence  and then the way forward to a democratic future is perfectly  clear, and the way forward for them to get into the talks about  the democratic future for Northern Ireland is perfectly clear.""    At the weekend, Mr John Hume, leader of the nationalist SDLP  [Social Democratic and Labour Party], urged the Prime Minister  to agree to Sinn Fein's request for clarification set out in a  letter sent by Mr Adams to Downing Street. Labour's spokesman,  Mr Kevin McNamara, also believes Sinn Fein is justified in  asking for further interpretation and there are signs of growing  strains between London and Dublin over the issue. Mr Reynolds  is due to make a keynote speech later today setting out where he  thinks the process is leading.    But the Prime Minister won support for refusing to be drawn  further on the declaration from Mr John Smith, Labour party  leader. He appeared to differ with Mr McNamara when he said:  ""The danger is that we enter into negotiations before we have  got the abandonment of violence.""    Mr Major clearly believes he has gone as far as he can in  seeking to accommodate the Provisional IRA without losing  backbench support.    ""I think what Mr Adams is about is seeking to drag us into a  negotiating position. I am not going to be drawn into  negotiations by the back door by Mr Adams.""    Mr Major denied Sinn Fein's suggestion that the Government  has not done enough to bring the IRA into the political process.  ""We have offered them much more than the extra mile,"" he said.  ""We have offered them a route into the democratic talks  themselves. That is what is on offer. All they have to do is  give up violence.""    Mr Major, who again ruled out an amnesty for convicted  terrorists, indicated that the time was approaching when a  definitive Sinn Fein response was needed. ""I have said I am  prepared to be patient. It is worth a little patience while  they examine whether they are going to give an affirmative  answer to give up violence.    ""The world does not stop during that period.... I can be  patient for a little while. There will come a time when it is  apparent that they are not going to respond. We will know  it--rather like an elephant, you will know it when you see it.    ""It can't be too long, but I am prepared to be patient for a  little while.""     "
0,FT934-1366 ,"FT934-1366 _AN-DLTC1AAIFT 931220   FT  20 DEC 93 / Reynolds warns IRA of crackdown: Irish PM will help UK over security if peace moves fail      By JAMES BLITZ and TIM COONE      LONDON, DUBLIN   Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, yesterday warned he would help Britain impose a tough security clamp-down against the IRA if it did not respond positively to the two governments' bid to bring peace to Northern Ireland. As Mr Reynolds sought to put further pressure on the IRA to give up its 25-year armed struggle against Britain's presence in Ulster, Mr John Major, the British prime minister, appealed to Ulster unionists to recognise the initiative as the last chance for peace. Mr Reynolds warned on BBC radio that both governments 'would be expected to respond' if loyalists and nationalists resumed the path of violence: 'After a period in which such strong support has been expressed by the people in both communities for peace, I think there would be revulsion over a resumption of full-scale violence,' he said. Mr Reynolds ruled out a return to internment for terrorist suspects, which he said was 'the strongest recruiting platform that the IRA were handed'. It seems increasingly unlikely that Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, will deliver an early response to the two governments' declaration last Wednesday. An indication of Sinn Fein's position came from Mr John Hume, leader of the Social Democratic and Labour Party, speaking after talks yesterday with Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president. Mr Hume said he believed Mr Adams was 'very serious' about peace in the region. In the Sunday Tribune newspaper in Dublin, Mr Adams said: 'Republicans will be considering (the joint declaration) in the context of Sinn Fein's peace strategy. We will approach it positively and seek to move the peace strategy forward.' The Republican movement, he said, would consider the declaration 'over Christmas and for some time after that . . . There are no quick fixes in this situation'. However, a bomb explosion in Londonderry yesterday showed the IRA was not committed to an unofficial ceasefire while deciding what action to take. Three children and two adults narrowly escaped being killed in the blast, which was the first attack since Wednesday's Downing Street declaration. Mr Reynolds tempered his warning about a security clampdown with hints of benefits to the IRA if it sued for peace. He also suggested London might negotiate over 'the future of prisoners' held in British jails: 'I think that's what the British government would have in mind in exploratory talks with Sinn Fein which they said would be within three months.' Downing Street officials said that the subject of prisoners was not among initial proposals for talks with Sinn Fein in the aftermath of a ceasefire. A Downing Street spokeswoman emphasised that British jails contained 'criminals' not 'political prisoners'. Unionist politicians also warned that they would oppose any amnesty for IRA prisoners as part of an overall deal. Mr Major's appeal to Northern Ireland's Unionists to accept the peace initiative, in an article for the Belfast newspaper, Sunday Life, said the joint initiative did not undermine the union between Britain and Northern Ireland. Mr Major said: 'I support the union. I have always supported the union. That is my personal right.' However he went on: 'But I shall not seek to impose my view on the greater number of people of Northern Ireland if they decide otherwise.'

0,FT923-1768 ,"FT923-1768 _AN-CIUDDAFHFT 920921   FT  21 SEP 92 / Survey of Northern Ireland (9): Sleeping with strangers - Co-operation North aims to bridge the social and cultural gap      By TIM COONE   A PROBABLE reaction of a Catholic teenager from Dublin being asked if he or she would like to spend a fun weekend in a Loyalist area of Belfast would be: 'Thanks. I'd rather a have week in Sarajevo.' A similar reaction might come from a Protestant youth being encouraged to spend a weekend on the Falls Road. Nonetheless, increasing numbers of teenagers, in Northern Ireland and in the Republic, are being asked to surrender the security of their own communities for a few days and live with a family in the 'enemy' camp, in a programme of school and youth exchanges promoted by an organisation known as Co-operation North. Established in 1979, by a group of leaders in business, trade unions and academic life on both sides of the border, the non-denominational body defines its mission as: 'To change attitudes by promoting practical co-operation between the people of Ireland, North and South, so that people respect each others' traditions and achieve greater levels of economic, social and cultural co-operation.' In 1986, the schools and youth exchange programmes were initiated, and 10,000 teenagers each year are now involved in sporting, school and cultural projects in which Catholics and Protestants mix and learn to overcome some of the prejudices they have grown up with. Such a programme would not seem extraordinary, or even necessary on the British mainland. But in Ulster - where Catholic neighbourhoods are often separated from Protestant neighbourhoods by high fences or corrugated iron walls and where most children go to a school of their own faith - there is an all-too-clear need for such an initiative. Co-operation North sees its role as falling into the category of 'Track-two diplomacy', a term coined by two US academics in the early 1980s in a study on diplomacy and conflict resolution. The theory is to encourage informal, unofficial contact between members of adversarial groups in a structured and systematic way. By targeting sports clubs, youth groups, schools and workplaces, a wide range of people in both communities are brought together, the ultimate aim of which is gradually to shift public opinion from being bigoted and prejudiced, to one of tolerance. This facilitates the official 'Track-one' diplomacy, carried out by the political leaders, who can be encouraged to take bolder initiatives at the negotiating table if they are aware that their constituents are more likely to be receptive to them. In Northern Ireland's case, there is still clearly a long way to go, but measurable progress has been achieved and efforts are being made to expand the scope of Co-operation North's work. An independent study commissioned recently by Co-operation North, found that, as a result of the exchanges, attitudes did change in a positive direction, but also noted that most of the teenagers participating in the school exchange schemes were primarily Catholic and from middle and upper class backgrounds. A spokeswoman for the organisation in Dublin said: 'The study has helped us to focus more clearly the groups we need to reach and we are now in the process of broadening and extending our work to the more disadvantaged communities of both denominations'. The EC, and the British and Irish governments have strongly endorsed the work of Co-operation North, and between them provide around 25 per cent of the organisation's annual Pounds 1.5m budget. In its last annual report, Co-operation North noted that 'to attain the critical mass estimated as necessary to achieve a large-scale impact on the situation, Co-operation North believes that its required annual budget would need to be Pounds 2.5m. It is quite clear that the organisation will have to move from an annual fund-raising strategy to the establishment of an endowment fund and more permanent funding arrangements with its institutional and corporate donors'. The balance of the organisation's funds presently come from donations, fund-raising activities and contributions from the International Fund for Ireland. Most of the major corporations north and south of the border are already supporting the organisation with regular donations.  The Financial Times   London Page 15  "
0,FT943-4016 ,"FT943-4016 _AN-EIKACAEXFT 940910   FT  10 SEP 94 / Travel: A land of cottages, peat smoke and pubs - Adrian Gardiner travels from the east coast of Ulster to the west coast of the Irish Republic. Destination: Holy Mountain      By ADRIAN GARDINER   Even before the IRA's ceasefire, the 'troubles' in Northern Ireland should not have deterred visitors. The strife was about money, about discrimination and relative standards of living. Political mistakes have been made in Ireland since Tudor times and the British taxpayer is still footing the bill. Statistically, the tourist is less at risk in Ulster than in New York or South America, though some find the rampant jingoism unacceptable. Leaving Newry, we skirted beautiful Carlingford Loch to Annalong, where sections of the pavement are painted unionist red, white and blue. In the next town along the coast a banner proclaimed: 'Kilkeel says No]' presumably to the Anglo-Irish agreement. Farther on, a roadsign pleaded: 'Our only crime is loyalty.' In contrast is the legendary friendliness of Ulster's people and the wonderfully picturesque land and seascapes. The Mountains of Mourne really do sweep down to the sea, which washes over miles of deserted white sands. Newcastle, the chief coastal resort, was anything but deserted. An hour's drive from Belfast, it is popular day-trip territory and the main street has more fast-food outlets to the mile than any town in Britain except Blackpool. As dusk falls, a riot of neon advertises pizza, kebabs, fried chicken and every other kind of carry-out devised. Amid the sleaze, one elegant and sophisticated beacon shines out: a restaurant called the Percy French. William Percy French led an extraordinary life. He was born in Roscommon in 1854 and went to Trinity College, Dublin, to study engineering, but spent most of his time learning to paint and play the banjo. For a while he was inspector of drains in Cavan and in his spare time wrote songs - The Mountains of Mourne is the best known - which made money which he invested in a distillery. It went bankrupt. He lost his job with the Board of Works, went to Dublin and became editor of the Jarvey, the Irish Punch. When that folded he wrote the first successful Irish musical, The Knight of the Road. His wife died in childbirth on their first wedding anniversary and French moved to London where he became established as a music hall entertainer, touring America and satisfying the thirst for Irish pop culture. He died in 1920, just as the era of the music hall was ending - and Ireland was dividing - and is best remembered as the man who, in the words of one biographer, 'captured the Irish spirit better than anyone of his time'. The Mournes are granite. Slieve Donard offers great panoramas: the Isle of Man is clearly visible. Wedged into these hills, the Silent Valley holds Belfast's water supply. Three feet wide, 8ft high, 22 miles long and connecting 15 mountain summits, the Mourne Wall protects the catchment area. No farming or habitation is allowed within its boundary. It is great walking country, and still relatively undiscovered. We left the Mournes, my wild rose and I, and journeyed west across the Republic in search of the Holy Mountain. Middle Ireland is little-visited by tourists, but the clear lakes and tumbling streams of County Cavan are an angler's paradise. We passed the town of Cavan, where Percy French's house is now open to the public, and travelled the roads French travelled, easel under his arm, for he loved this scenery, 'unique in its combination of sun-stricken mist, brown bogland and green pasturage, solitary trees and far-off visionary mountains'. Rural Ireland is still a land that time forgot, a land of tumble-down cottages, donkey carts and peat smoke, of pubs where the choice is Guinness or Guinness. At Carrick we were back briefly in the 20th century. Wine bars and bistros jostle with chandlers and marine engineers, for here the broad Shannon attracts people who like to mess about in boats. We continued west towards Atlantic shores, through the Ox Mountains on lonely roads, the landscape becoming increasingly wild. The northern edge of County Mayo is the Barony of Erris and part of the Gaeltach, the Irish-speaking fringe which runs down the west coast from Donegal to County Cork. Always there is restless sea and changing light. Along the northern headlands of Erris, the Atlantic, untamed for 3,000 miles, crashes in on the 1,000ft cliffs of Glinsk and Benwee Head. Gulls circled far below us. Small wonder that several ships of the Spanish Armada lie beneath these waves. Halfway down the Mullet peninsula we turned for the ruins of Cross Abbey and its dramatic hillside of Celtic crosses. Far out to sea was the island of Inishglora where the Swan Children of Lyr served out the last third of their 900-year curse. (The wicked stepmother story is familiar to Irish children.) From Blacksod Point, most southerly on the Mullet, the twin peaks of Achill Island lie just four miles south, though it takes two hours by road to get there. Above Blacksod on the headland is a henge of standing stones erected last year as an exhibit on the Mayo sculpture trail: a dozen outdoor structures by local and invited foreign artists. The setting is superb. South of Achill is Westport, a Georgian town of wood-panelled pubs and smart craft and jewellery shops, while nearby Westport House is one of Ireland's best-known stately homes. Down the hill is Westport Harbour, a cluster of authentic fishing taverns, and a few miles west is our 'far-off visionary mountain': the 2,500ft sheer cone of Croagh Patrick, the Holy Mountain. St Patrick, fresh from driving the snakes out of Ireland, fasted here one Lent; every year on the last Sunday in July 60,000 pilgrims follow in his footsteps to the top. You have to be dedicated because the path becomes increasingly steep and is composed of rounded pebbles. Two hours later and 300 yards from the summit I nearly gave up. I was glad I did not. No superlatives could describe the view as half of the Emerald Isle unfolded beneath our feet. To the north is Achill's brooding bulk shrouded in aureoles of mist. To the south: the Maamturk Mountains of Connemara. Below: the thousand islands of Clew Bay, described by Thackeray as like 'so many dolphins and whales basking'. Out in the Atlantic, the sun began to set behind Clare Island, where the 16th-century pirate queen Grace O'Malley built her castle. Perhaps Grace was the first Irish rebel, for when she was captured and brought before Elizabeth I she insisted on equal status as Queen of Ireland. It was during Elizabeth's reign that the seeds of the present troubles were sown. But from the holy heights of Croagh Patrick, Belfast and bombs seem to belong to a different world. We sailed from Stranraer to Belfast on the Seacat, a state-of-the-art catamaran which does twice the speed of conventional ferries. It does not carry freight, so loading and unloading is rapid.

Downing Street has acknowledged that the leak has damaged attempts by prime minister John Major and Mr Albert Reynolds, his Irish counterpart, to secure a comprehensive constitutional settlement, casting a pall over next month's planned Anglo-Irish summit in Dublin. Mr James Molyneaux, the Ulster Unionist leader, this week urged Mr John Major to stop looking for such a settlement, claiming the Dublin proposals offered 'structure that would bring about the unification of the Irish territory'. Dublin's move came as the IRA said it was committed to securing 'a just and lasting' peace, while accusing London and Dublin of 'playing politics' with the Irish issue. Using an article in its Republican News mouthpiece, the IRA sought to undermine recent suggestions it might be tiring of the armed struggle. The two governments should 'harbour no doubts about the determination with which we, our activists and supporters will apply ourselves to realising our objectives,' it warned. In London, Mr Seamus Mallon, deputy leader of the mainly Catholic SDLP, sought to inject momentum into the quest for a settlement by calling on the main protaganists to reject their entrenched positions and compromise. 'Peace is going to have to make all of us make concessions and bite our lips,' he said. Yesterday Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, offered fresh assurances to unionists about Dublin's intentions in efforts to reach a settlement. 'There should be no fears or suspicions among unionists.

Today PO managers are due to meet officials from the RMT transport union to try to prevent strike action by crews on the same ferry services. The crews are opposed to the radical changes in working hours and to a pay freeze. Yesterday's decision will add to pressure on the company to modify its cost-cutting plans.

On that question yesterday hinged what happens next in the Northern Ireland peace process. When it flashed on to news screens at 11.54 am, the IRA's statement contained many fine phrases and much grounds for optimism. But it pointedly avoided committing the organisation to the permanent cessation of violence which London and Dublin have demanded before allowing Sinn Fein into political talks on the province's future. Instead it promised a 'complete cessation of military operations' as of midnight last night. It might seem churlish to quibble over semantics on one of the most historic days in the province's recent history. But IRA leaders must have known that their statement would be judged by many on the basis of whether it committed them to a permanent ceasefire. It seems inconceivable, therefore, that the word's exclusion was not carefully judged and deliberate. This was certainly the view of unionists, who quickly warned that the statement did not fulfil the two governments' terms. Mr James Molyneaux, the Ulster Unionist party leader, said bluntly it could not 'trigger' the countdown of the three-month period within which London has promised to enter preliminary dialogue with Sinn Fein in the event of a permanent end to violence. It is crucial that Mr Molyneaux stays on board if the revitalised peace process is to stand any chance of success. Mr John Major's initial response to the statement, first circulated about lunchtime, was somewhat ambiguous. 'I am greatly encouraged by this, but we need to be clear that this is indeed intended to be a permanent renunciation of violence, that is to say, for good,' he said, implying that the clock would not start ticking without clarification from republican leaders. 'If they are genuinely and irrevocably committed to use only peaceful and democratic methods in the future, then we shall respond positively.' But his exhortation to 'let words now be reflected in deeds,' suggested it might be acceptable for the clarification to take the form of an extended period without violence. Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, later aligned the government firmly with Mr Molyneaux, however, saying that the question of permanency had to be resolved before the government would consider that the three-month period had started. 'This is so important a matter that it ought not to be left at large or able to be the subject of discussion and argument,' Sir Patrick said. His words appeared to open up daylight between the government's stance and the position of Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, who said he thought IRA violence was permanently finished. It also opened the prospect of a tense period of cat-and-mouse politics involving the two governments and republican leaders, similar to that which followed the Downing Street declaration. Under the timetable set out by the government, preliminary talks would begin with Sinn Fein within three months of it receiving the assurances it requires. This would have three purposes: To explore the basis on which Sinn Fein would be admitted to an 'inclusive political talks process'. To exchange views on how Sinn Fein would be able in time to play the same part as the other constitutional parties in Ulster's public life. To examine the practical consequences of ending violence. These practical matters would be expected to include the handing in of IRA weapons, the treatment of IRA prisoners, the question of security and the broadcasting ban on Sinn Fein representatives. Some ministers believe the ban no longer serves any useful purpose and should be lifted as soon as possible. On troop deployment, the government is expected to emphasise that decisions are the responsibility of military commanders. But a reduction of troop strength in response to a reduction in the perceived threat of violence has not been ruled out.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.     IEZ  Ireland, EC.

Shortly after the blast another security alert caused Liverpool Street main line station to be closed and Underground services from there were suspended.

Nobody has claimed responsibility for the incidents, but they are in line with the current IRA campaign of disrupting train services. Last month an IRA bomb at London Bridge station injured 28 people.

The decision by the coroner's jury in Enniskillen, Co Fermanagh, that troops did not challenge Seamus McElwaine could open the way for legal action by his relatives. In the shooting, which took place nearly seven years ago near the village of Roslea, Co Fermanagh, McElwaine was killed and another terrorist wounded as they prepared a culvert bomb ambush on security forces. At the time McElwaine was on the run from the top-security Maze prison after being part of a IRA jailbreak. The inquest jury also decided that five minutes after the four soldiers involved first shot McElwaine, they fired again as he lay injured. The troops insisted that the pair were challenged just before they opened fire. Last night Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, called for the four soldiers to be charged with murder and for Mr Archie Hamilton, the defence minister, to face criminal charges. It claimed that the ruling once again highlighted Britain's 'shoot-to-kill' policy.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P9229  Public Order and Safety, NEC.

Hume, whose talks with Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein leader,  opened up the latest peace process, said that if the party was  shown to be bluffing he would turn his back on it and ensure  Sinn Fein's total isolation from democratic politics.    The veteran nationalist leader said there were two possible  consequences if the government agreed to Sinn Fein's demand.  ""One is a total cessation of violence with all its enormous  positive consequences or, as some people believe but I don't, if  Sinn Fein is bluffing then its bluff will have been called and  it will be isolated in a way it has never been before.""    Hume said he was disappointed that the ceasefire, due to  last  from Tuesday to Thursday, was so short. ""I wanted a complete  cessation of violence,"" he said.    An Irish government spokesman said Albert Reynolds, the  taoiseach [prime minister], shared dismay at the failure of the  IRA to deliver a permanent end to violence. ""The feeling has  been growing that if we or the British give them one more  concession they will just demand more,"" he said.    The spokesman emphasised that Reynolds was bringing no  pressure on the British, either privately or publicly, to meet  Sinn Fein. He said: ""John Hume speaks for himself on this one.  He must be deeply disappointed.""    Republican sources said yesterday that the IRA had  originally  intended to hold the ceasefire in June. It appears to have been  rushed forward following pressure from Hume and prominent Irish  Americans, many of whom were disappointed by the failure of  Adams to announce concessions on his visit to the United States  earlier this year.    Bill Flynn, the New York businessman who invited Adams, has  voiced growing impatience with Sinn Fein in recent weeks. This  weekend Father Sean McManus, another key Irish-American  activist, said he did not believe that a three-day suspension of  hostilities was enough to satisfy the growing demand from Irish  Americans for an end to the conflict.    Yesterday, Adams appeared to soften Sinn Fein's position. He  gave the party's clearest indication yet that a British  declaration of intent to withdraw from Northern Ireland was not  a pre-condition for a complete cessation of IRA violence. ""At  the end of the day, republicans want to see an end to British  jurisdiction in Ireland. But we have to take on board that the  Unionists have an opposite view,"" he said.    However, an IRA source said the movement's leaders were  claiming to be on the brink of victory. They have told internal  meetings that the government last year gave assurances that it  secretly wanted Irish unity. Martin McGuinness, the Sinn Fein  leader involved in secret contacts with the government, is  expected to allude to these alleged assurances at a republican  rally in Dublin today.    There are growing fears in security circles that if the  government does not budge there will be an escalation of  terrorism.    IRA members have been told to prepare for a renewed terror  campaign, while loyalist paramilitaries have ended their  informal contacts with the Irish government and are threatening  to start a bombing campaign throughout Ireland.    The British and Irish governments appear to have accepted  that there is unlikely to be an early end to violence. They  have begun drawing up a joint document on the future government  of the province and Anglo-lrish relations.    An Irish government source said the document would be  unveiled when events had ""cooled down"" after the European  elections in june.    Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, said:  ""The two governments are working on a joint structure scheme  that will represent, in their view, the best means by which a  satisfactory package could get broad support.""

The party's national executive committee will today approve a flexible interpretation of the rules on female representation, in line with a compromise approach adopted by Mr Tony Blair, Labour leader. Opponents of positive discrimination said they remained hopeful that next week's annual conference in Blackpool would overturn quota rules agreed last year as part of a package of constitutional reforms. Ms Nicola Kutapan, co-convenor of Labour Supporters for Real Equality, said Mr Blair's flexible approach was a welcome sign that the party leadership no longer believed the quota policy was workable. She said: 'There is a considerable amount of opinion among constituency parties about this, and I don't think people are going to be willing to let it drop.' Critics say that the rules discriminate against men because they require female representation in constituency delegations and all-women short-lists in some parliamentary seats. Constituency parties have tabled 13 resolutions calling for the policy to be scrapped. Delegates to the GMB general union conference earlier this year also expressed support for a reversal of discriminatory selection procedures. The NEC will also formally approve an invitation from the Labour leadership to Mr John Hume, leader of the nationalist SDLP, to address the conference on Northern Ireland. SDLP officials said Mr Hume would not attempt to intervene in the growing Labour debate over the party's commitment to campaign for Irish unity-by-consent. Supporters of a more neutral approach fear that his speech will bolster support for the party's nationalist wing, led by Mr Kevin Macnamara, shadow Northern Ireland secretary. Independent Labour Publications, the pressure group behind an emergency resolution seeking a review of the unity-by-consent formula, said the invitation to Mr Hume 'smacks of a manoeuvre to maintain support for a discredited policy'. Mr Calum MacDonald, Labour MP for the Western Isles, urged Labour to 'separate our political sympathies for John Hume as a socialist, and our respect for the work he has done to get the peace process going, from his nationalism, which is a different matter altogether'.

Sinn Fein said it would hold a public ""Peace Commission"" in  Belfast a week after the conference.    The party -- the IRA's political wing -- has been holding  the  sessions all over Ireland.

But both have shown increasing signs of impatience at the  long delay and had pinned hopes on Sinn Fein president Gerry  Adams delivering an answer at the conference.

Mr Mallon told the BBC Radio Ulster programme Inside  Politics  that the cessation of violence would come from within the  republican movement.    There was a ""burning desire"" for peace within the whole  community and the section within the republican movement which  wanted to continue the violence would find it impossible to  sustain it in the face of that public desire.

As London and Dublin struggled to stop their peace initiative being blown off track by last week's mortar attacks at London's Heathrow airport, officials promised new talks on security co-operation between the two governments as a matter of urgency. Downing Street - responding to fresh IRA demands for direct talks between London and republican leaders - said it was a 'fundamental principle' of December's joint declaration that there would be no negotiations with Sinn Fein in advance of an end to IRA violence. That principle was not going to change. It was 'deeply offensive' to people in Britain and Ireland that the IRA should claim to be interested in peace while continuing to kill people in cold blood and to prosecute its campaign of terror. However, Downing Street's choice of words appeared to leave the door open for a possible resumption of messages between London and republican leaders. When last year's secret contacts were exposed in November, Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, said the messages had not amounted to negotiating with terrorists. The president of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, yesterday continued his efforts to wrong-foot the government, saying that Sinn Fein had 'no great concern' to be engaged in bilateral discussions with London on constitutional matters. Repeating his call for clarification, Mr Gerry Adams welcomed the first official IRA response to the Downing Street declaration on Sunday, describing it as a 'positive reiteration' of the IRA's commitment to reaching a negotiated peace deal. Mr John Hume, leader of the mainly Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party, said that London should launch new talks with Sinn Fein. He insisted that the IRA did not intend to detonate any of the mortar bombs which were fired into Heathrow in three separate attacks. Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, said the attacks on Heathrow were 'a gross miscalculation by the IRA' which was not going to advance the peace process. Mr John Major is expected to be pressed to tighten security in meetings with the leaders of the two main unionist parties this week. The Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the hard-line Democratic Unionists, said yesterday that the prime minister had not got 'the guts or spine or ability' to stand up to Dublin.

It emerged yesterday that Mr William Flyn, president of Mutual America, one of the biggest US insurance companies, has renewed contact with Sinn Fein while on a visit this week to Dublin and Belfast. Mr Flyn is part of a delegation of Irish-American businessmen who have been discussing investment oppor-tunities on both sides of the Irish border with government officials and local enterprises. He is understood to have used the opportunity of the visit to try to persuade Sinn Fein of the growing support within the Irish-American community for the UK-Irish peace initiative. Mr Flyn was one of the central figures behind the controversial visit of Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, to New York in February. His invitation to Mr Adams to speak at a conference on Northern Ireland led to President Bill Clinton granting the Sinn Fein leader a visa against the advice of British and US state department officials.

The provocative and potentially devastating attack, in which four mortar bombs were fired from a hotel car park towards the airport's northern runway, came as the Commons debated renewal of legislation to combat IRA violence. MPs also voted to set up a new cross-party committee on Northern Ireland issues. The attack - in which no-one was injured - came on the eve of the latest meeting in London of Irish and British ministers to prepare a blueprint for a political settlement in the province. Mr John Major, the prime minister, is likely to come under pressure in the Commons today to make clear that the government's patience has run out in waiting for a response from the republican movement to the Downing Street declaration. MPs will demand that the government now enforces a new security crackdown. Last night's attack, which police said was accompanied with a recognised IRA warning, caused widespread disruption at Heathrow, which is the world's busiest international airport. The four mortars, fired from beyond the airport perimeter, failed to detonate, but two landed on the airport's northern runway. Aircraft continued to take off from the runway for about 30 minutes after the attack until it was closed by police. Six-foot long tubes full of high explosives were used to fire the devices in the attack about 400 yards from the runway. The devices were fired from a Nissan Micra car just before 6pm from the Excelsior Hotel car park. The attack, announced to the Commons by Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, provided a powerful reminder of the failure of last December's Anglo-Irish declaration to halt the IRA's terrorism campaign, and again demonstrated its ability to strike high-security targets. London and Dublin have been hoping that Sinn Fein might persuade the IRA to end its campaign of violence and enter the peace process. But with its hopes apparently rebuffed, both governments will today make clear their determination to press on with talks aimed at a political settlement. Downing Street said last night that the declaration and the principles underlying it remained intact. The attack, the first time the IRA has used mortars in mainland Britain since its attempt to bomb 10 Downing Street in 1991, coincided with the House of Commons debate on the annual renewal of the Prevention of Terrorism Act. Mr Howard said he was 'deeply concerned' at what had obviously been a very serious attack. He had called for a detailed report on the incident and would see what lessons could be learnt. As the Commons backed the renewal of the act by a margin of 86, Mr Howard told MPs: 'I do not know whether that incident is supposed to send some message to the House as we conclude our debate on these matters.' He added: 'If it is, I know that there is only one conclusion that this House can responsibly take. We know in unequivocal terms that the Association of Chief Police Officers considers this act in its present form to be essential in the fight against terrorism'. Earlier, an attempt by the Labour party to establish a new cross-party consensus on the retention of the anti-terrorism legislation ended in acrimony and recriminination in the Commons. Labour MPs were angered by Mr Howard's rejection of opposition calls for an inquiry by a senior judge into the provisions permitting terrorist suspects to be detained for questioning for up to seven days, and for those from Northern Ireland to be excluded from mainland Britain. Heathrow is an important economic target. In addition to handling more than 42m passengers a year, it employs 50,000 people - 1,400 of them security staff - and supports an estimated 20,000 local jobs.

Several speakers in the defence debate called for Britain to abandon the Trident nuclear-missile programme as a first step to a worldwide ban on nuclear weapons. There were also calls for an end to arms exports, and progressive cuts in defence spending given the end of the cold war. But calls for unilateral disarmament no longer sway the conference as they did in the mid-1980s. The party endorsed each proposal to maintain defence spending put forward by Mr Campbell, including the reshaping of defence policy to meet possible new threats. He said Britain should resist any demands for 'another raid' on the defence budget even if recent attempts to forge peace in Northern Ireland led to a reduction in troops there. He also demanded that the government maintain its military presence in the former Yugoslavia.

But, speaking on the eve of a meeting between the government and loyalist representatives, Mr John Major said he was determined to ensure paramilitary arsenals were 'no longer available for use in terrorist attacks'. In comments which may concern some unionists who are still suspicious about the IRA's intentions, the prime minister said he was 'not pedantic about whether those weapons are surrendered or whether those weapons are decommissioned, destroyed with some form of verification - I don't mind'. What was important was that a political party should not be able to 'go back to a nice little stockpile of weapons if something went against them and start using them again'. His remarks came as he unveiled Pounds 75m of private investment in the province in the textiles, telecommunications and automotive sectors. The package was the highlight of a buoyant Belfast International Investment conference, overshadowing a walkout by Sinn Fein representatives. The prime minister told the 300 delegates at Ulster's biggest business event since the troubles began 25 years ago that a 'virtuous circle' was taking shape. 'Peace is giving rise to prosperity; prosperity in turn will consolidate peace,' he said. Setting out the province's stall to potential investors, Mr Major announced a new government work programme for the long-term unemployed. He said the programme would help 1,000 long-term jobless over two years and would be expanded 'substantially' if successful. The programme is under-stood to be the first stage of a two-pronged government initiative. The Northern Ireland Office's department of economic development is thought to be working on proposals to focus its aid effort more on areas of high unemployment, including politically sensitive west Belfast. After receiving a warm welcome from shoppers at Portadown, Mr Major dismissed Sinn Fein's walkout from yesterday's conference, saying: 'I think they have shot themselves in the foot rather badly.' IRA weapons are top of the government's agenda in its preliminary dialogue with Sinn Fein, which will resume next week when the two sides attempt to draw up a more detailed agenda for discussions.

London and Dublin again criticised the short ceasefire as an inadequate gesture and made clear their exasperation at the IRA's refusal to declare a permanent end to violence, which they say could pave the way to lasting peace. The two governments hope their firm refusal to give any ground might encourage the IRA to consider an extension of the ceasefire, though there were no indications from the republican movement that such action is likely. Republicans continued to insist that the next move must come from the British government in the shape of an offer to open direct talks. One Easter rally yesterday heard a warning that Britain could expect more violence unless talks began. Dublin, which has already provided Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, with clarification of parts of the Downing Street declaration, is making clear that it will not put pressure on London to provide further clarification. Both governments have rejected suggestions that low-level talks might take place with Sinn Fein during the ceasefire. But in the unlikely event that it is extended beyond Friday, pressure to restart some form of contact would soon mount. Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, who is on holiday, is being kept abreast of developments, according to a government spokesman. But the latest statements from Sinn Fein leaders at the weekend 'have not changed the situation', he said. In separate speeches made on Sunday in Belfast and Dublin to commemorate the 1916 Easter rising, Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, and Mr Martin McGuinness, a prominent member of Sinn Fein's national executive, called on London to respond to the 'potential' offered by the ceasefire initiative. Cardinal Cahal Daly, the Roman Catholic Primate of all Ireland, yesterday added his weight to that pressure saying that a 'meaningful extension' of the ceasefire would help encourage a 'constructive response' from the British and Irish governments. Such hopes appeared to fade after a warning delivered at a rally in County Tyrone, Northern Ireland by two masked IRA men who said: 'The British will be glad to get out of Ireland when our work is done.' They claimed the republican movement in Tyrone had never been stronger, more united and confident and said last month's mortar bombings at Heathrow airport had 'worked wonders' for morale.

0,FT944-9427 ,"FT944-9427 _AN-EKPEKAAMFT 941116   FT  16 NOV 94 / Irish coalition teeters on the brink: How a political marriage turned sour      By JOHN MURRAY BROWN      DUBLIN   Ireland woke up wearily yesterday to the realisation that yet another government had been dragged close to the brink of collapse. The political showdown, which could yet be resolved in parliament today, has nonetheless soured relations between Fianna Fail and its Labour partner. On this occasion it was triggered by Labour party criticism of the attorney general's mishandling of a child abuse case. The Fianna Fail prime minister, Mr Albert Reynolds, almost certainly misjudged the reaction of his junior coalition partner to his appointment of the attorney general, Mr Harry Whelehan, as president of the High Court. However, the roots of this particular breakdown go deeper and lie in the unhappy marriage between Fianna Fail, the dominant force in Irish politics since the foundation of the state in the 1920s, and Labour, the small left-of-centre party. From the beef tribunal scandal to the famous X-case involving the attorney general's injunction preventing a 14-year-old rape victim from seeking an abortion in the UK, Labour has looked increasingly uncomfortable. Even on the key foreign policy issue of Northern Ireland, there were suggestions that Labour was unhappy with Mr Reynolds's insistence on forcing the pace on the peace process. The government was formed in January 1993, after the 1992 general election prompted by Fianna Fail's falling out with its former partners, the Progressive Democrats. There have been natural policy differences. On social issues, Labour has had to swallow hard. Despite six cabinet posts against Fianna Fail's nine, it has appeared isolated from the key economic decision-making. A tax amnesty aimed at enticing black earnings into the exchequer, passed last year, was unsuccessfully resisted by Labour. There have been squabbles about how to spend the Pounds 7bn Ireland receives from the European Union in farm support and structural and other funds. But in many dispassionate Irish eyes, the coalition, the first between these two parties, has made considerable legislative progress, passing some 40 bills. At one level, the Reynolds-Spring team seemed an awkward combination. It was partly a question of generation - Mr Reynolds at 59, is 15 years older than the Labour leader, Mr Dick Spring. Mr Reynolds, despite heading what is in Ireland the establishment party, is unusual in being a self-made man, having amassed a fortune in the pet food business and before that as a showband impresario. Mr Spring, by contrast, entered politics in 1981, taking over the North Kerry seat on the death of his father, a dynastic practice common in the Irish parliament. But, at a deeper level, there is a fundamental personality difference. Mr Reynolds's can-do approach to policy has often seemed high-handed, and has irritated the prickly and rather solemn Labour leader. In the current row, for all the high moral talk of 'public accountability', there were few illusions in Dublin that the real scalp Mr Spring is seeking is that of Mr Reynolds himself. They have clashed before; on both occasions Mr Spring gave ground. First, there was the case of the two foreigners who had invested in Mr Reynolds's petfood business who were given citizenship: the so-called 'passports for sale' scandal. The final straw was the Beef Tribunal, an investigation into the misuse of official export credits, where Mr Spring again found himself questioning the prime minister's role. With convenient timing, when the Dail (parliament) came to debate the issue, the controversy was overshadowed by the IRA's ceasefire. In forcing the issue to a head, Mr Spring has clearly calculated that this crisis is sufficient to take to the country, a measure of how the moral climate has changed in Ireland in the past two decades. The emotive issue of child abuse by a Catholic priest, is seen by the Labour strategists as a natural winner, pitting 'secular' Labour against Fianna Fail, traditionally the church's political ally. Fianna Fail may still command the loyalty of its largely rural-based support; an opinion poll only 10 days put the party streets ahead, with 50 per cent. However, with one of the youngest populations in Europe, and the fastest rates of rural depopulation, this latest crisis could well signal a significant shift in the centre of political gravity in Irish politics. Like British attitudes to royalty, the Irish have a fascination with the moral mishaps of their priests. As Fianna Fail's popularity at the polls fades, so the church's hold over society has weakened, and the old irredentist myths of a united Ireland have faded. In a society which holds its rock stars up as examples of excellence, Fianna Fail no longer looks to many younger people like the natural party of government. It would doubly ironic if, as seemed possible yesterday, President Mary Robinson were now to play a key role in this crisis. It was her election, more than any other recent event which underlined these changes. Her victory as Ireland's first woman president marked Fianna Fail's first ever defeat for its presidential candidate.   Countries:-  IEZ  Ireland, EC.

In a move fuelling hopes of a breakthrough in the search for  a political settlement in Ulster, the IRA's political wing has  submitted a detailed list of questions to officials in Dublin,  who will relay them to London.    Irish Prime Minister Albert Reynolds was on a short trip to  the US today after again making clear his determination that the  clarification logjam could not be allowed to continue.    In a Dublin speech last night, Northern Ireland Secretary  Sir  Patrick Mayhew made no reference to clarification, which Britain  has consistently refused to deliver to Sinn Fein.    But earlier Deputy Irish Premier Dick Spring said no stone  should be left unturned in the effort to explain the declaration  signed by John Major and Mr Reynolds last December.    Mr. Reynolds is expected to refer to the peace process in a  speech at Notre Dame University, Indiana, where he is to receive  an honorary dedgree on Sunday [15 May].

The three advertisements - a scene from one of which is pictured - cost Pounds 373,000. They are to be shown in Ulster to encourage the use of a confidential police telephone line. 'Government must tackle the evil of terrorism by every practical means,' said Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary. 'These films are part of that effort.' Two of the films are so violent they will only be shown after the 9pm watershed. One depicts two weddings. Later one groom murders the other and the killer is jailed. The two wives pass in the street without knowing each other. The second portrays how violence is handed down through the generations. A father is involved in random killings in a bar. Later his son is murdered as his young son looks on. The third shows a tragedy avoided because of the use of the telephone line. Sir Patrick said: 'It is not the government's wish to re-open grievous and painful wounds. But terrorist crime continues to extinguish lives and blight many more.' He added that the campaign was aimed at those involved in or on the verge of committing terrorist acts.   Countries:-  IEZ  Ireland, EC.   Industries:-  P9229 Public Order and Safety, NEC.

Speaking in Belfast at the launch of his party's manifesto, he welcomed Mr John Major's recent statement that there would be no coalition government. However, his comments did not rule out an informal arrangement between the UUP and the Tories. If there was a hung parliament, Mr Molyneaux said, the UUP would take into account what was said in the Queen's Speech by the new government on policy issues regarding Northern Ireland, the economy and the Maastricht Treaty. Mr Molyneaux attacked the Liberal Democrats' ambition of participating in a coalition government. 'It is unacceptable that a rump of a party could be dictating the future of the UK,' he said, adding that his party was not 'making any demands.' But he warned that 'whoever forms the government knows where we stand and will have to take care not to alienate us'. Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, yesterday ruled out taking part in any coalition government which relied on the support of Ulster Unionists. He said it would jeopardise progress the government had made towards peace in the province. Mr Jim Nicholson, UUP chairman, said his party wanted devolution for Ulster and 'would not countenance a devolved structure in Scotland only'. He added: 'We would be happy to be the guinea-pigs for new regional devolution arrangements - we, after all, have the most experience in this'. He said that the UUP - which had nine MPs in the last parliament - would support a Labour administration if its policies were acceptable. Mr Ken Maginnis, UUP security spokesman, said he may 'make public' a recent letter he had received from Mr Major. He said it showed a 'much more positive response' to Unionist demands for security in Ulster to be stepped up. The UUP manifesto calls for: Restoration of the rule of law through the destruction of higher echelons within terrorist organisations. A clearly defined union, with the Queen in parliament remaining supreme. Removal of the Irish Republic's claim to Northern Ireland and an end to the Anglo-Irish agreement.

0,FT943-9494 ,"FT943-9494 _AN-EHKC0AA1FT 940811   FT  11 AUG 94 / World Trade News: A very faint ripping sound - A look at restructuring in the European textiles industry      By JENNY LUESBY   If the textile and clothing industry were not dominated by small companies, a restructuring which has seen it account for 30 per cent of manufacturing job losses in the European Union since 1988 might have caused more of a stir. Instead, with relative quietness, productivity has risen by 25 per cent in the clothing industry and 17 per cent in textiles - against a manufacturing average of 10 per cent - production has been cut, and 600,000 jobs have been shed. There have been scuffles. A group of senior British industrialists is due to meet Sir Patrick Mayhew, Britain's Northern Ireland secretary, today to try to persuade the British government to withdraw its support for a Pounds 157m (Dollars 243m) textile plant near Belfast which the industrialists say will lead to further job losses. But by and large the sector's contraction has been accompanied by little politicking. Restructuring has brought a slicker, leaner industry, which now faces the phasing out of protective quotas under the Multi-Fibre Arrangement with expectations of a gradual and partial decline, rather than annihilation. A more severe future was possible. Even with the MFA in place, the industry has been confronted by its inability to compete on cost with producers in low-cost countries, particularly in Asia. Textile and clothing production has traditionally been labour intensive. European labour is expensive labour. And it is labour costs that have been the main cause of the European industry's loss of competitiveness, concludes a recent study for the European Commission. As a result, clothing and textile imports into the EU have risen sharply. Excluding imports arising from subcontracting by European producers outside the EU, clothing imports into the EU rose by 80 per cent between 1988 and 1993. Within textiles, it has been the earliest stages in the production chain and the least technical areas of production that have been hardest hit. European consumption of very basic fabrics, especially synthetic and cotton fabrics, is now dominated by imports. For other fabrics, the loss of market share to imports is progressing up the textiles production chain, with fibre producers the first to suffer, followed by spinners and weavers. The finishing and dying of fabrics remains largely unassailed by direct competition because of its greater technological complexity, but it is still feeding a contracting market thanks to the displacement of clothing manufacturers through imports. Moreover, the entire industry has suffered the effects of the European recession. The EU is still the largest market in the world for clothing, and, with more than 50 per cent of textile output sold to clothing producers, the fortunes of textiles and clothing producers are inextricably linked. Upwards of another 20 per cent of textile output goes to producers of home furnishings and carpets, and a further 20 per cent to industry, much of it to cars and construction. However, although recovery will help the industry it will not reverse the steady decline in spending on clothing and footwear as a proportion of total consumption. The industry's response has been two-fold. Some producers have secured themselves and their markets through targeting niche or high-quality markets unlikely to be satisfied through low-cost mass production. More generally, producers have played to their strengths, in terms of proximity and versatility, by shifting towards just-in-time delivery, in short runs, of products made to customer's own specifications - a trend particularly noticeable in the UK. Another approach, in which German producers have led the way, has been to move away from integrated production and, instead, subcontract from low-cost countries on the European rim, particularly eastern Europe, but also North Africa and Turkey. The ending of the MFA, as agreed in the Uruguay Round of world trade talks, is scheduled to take place in four phases over 10 years, beginning on January 1 1995, when 16 per cent of quotas will be removed. Officials from both the European Commission and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade foresee little difficulty in identifying this first 16 per cent, although there may be some wrangling within the EU over whether any effective quotas should be offered up, by way of good faith. Europe will be able to choose which quotas it removes at each stage. And when the phase-out bites harder, as further quotas are removed and existing ones raised at the beginning of 1998, 2002 and 2005, the industry will not be without some safeguards against real injury to markets. Clothing and textiles are to be incorporated into the Gatt, which does allow quotas in cases of serious damage to industries. But there can be no change to the scale and pace of the phase-out and the end of the arrangement will exacerbate the effects of global trends on the European industry. By type of product, industry experts Kurt Salmon Associates point to the bed linen and blankets sector as the next to be hit by heavy competition from imports, followed in the second half of the 1990s by the more technologically sophisticated curtain and table linen sectors. And by country, it will be those producers, predominantly in southern Europe, who have so far escaped the need to restructure because of their lower costs, that will be hardest hit. However, for Europe's textile negotiators, the lifting of the MFA is barely a hardship at all. They have the huge growth in exports from China to worry about - and that was never covered by the MFA.   Countries:-  XGZ  Europe.   Industries:-  P22   Textile Mill Products.

0,FT944-8534 ,"FT944-8534 _AN-EKTAWAB2FT 941119   FT  19 NOV 94 / An unwelcome diversion: Ireland's political crisis could hardly have occurred at a more awkward time for the peace process      By JOHN MURRAY BROWN   Eleven weeks after the IRA ceasefire, fresh uncertainty has descended on the Northern Ireland peace process, throwing up the possibility of further delays in the political negotiations to end the 25-year-old conflict. On Thursday Mr Albert Reynolds, Ireland's prime minister, was drummed out of office, after allegations that he misled parliament over a controversial extradition case involving a paedophile Catholic priest. The resignation of Mr Reynolds has left Ireland under a caretaker administration, while parliament tries to agree a new coalition. But the absence of a government in Dublin has also left the delicate peace process apparently frozen. The crisis was triggered by opposition to the appointment by Mr Reynolds of Mr Harry Whelehan, a former attorney general, as president of the Irish High Court. Mr Whelehan's former office is facing allegations that it delayed for seven months the extradition of Father Brendan Smyth to face charges in Northern Ireland of child abuse. Mr Whelehan has also been involved in other controversial cases, including the investigation in 1991 into the misuse of official export credits in Ireland's beef scandal. As attorney general, he issued an injunction in the notorious 1992 'X-case' to prevent a 14-year-old rape victim travelling to the UK for an abortion. When Mr Reynolds persisted in making the appointment, the coalition between his Fianna Fail party and Mr Dick Spring's Irish Labour party collapsed after 22 months in office. Mr Reynolds resigned as prime minister before a parliamentary vote of confidence that he would have lost. Mr Whelehan, the cause of the crisis, resigned from his new office. At one point, however, it seemed that the affair might have much more far-reaching consequences. Mr Pat Rabbitte of the Democratic Left, told the Irish parliament of documents that would 'rock the foundations of the state'. Rumours circulated in the Dail, Ireland's parliament, that the head of the Catholic Church, Cardinal Cahal Daly, may have intervened on Father Smyth's behalf - a rumour quickly scotched by the Cardinal with good humour. Such was the massive public interest in the drama unfolding in the Dail, even pilots on Aer Lingus flights felt obliged to provide their customers with constant in-flight updates as the government teetered. Dublin's troubles could hardly have occurred at a more awkward time for the peace process. The UK and Irish governments have been locked in talks on the framework document that will form the basis of future talks involving Ulster's principal political parties. Ideally, this would have been finalised before London begins the exploratory talks it has promised to open with Sinn Fein before Christmas. Some disruption to the timetable now seems unavoidable. Agreement between the parties on a new coalition could be days, perhaps weeks away. If the search fails, parliament will be dissolved and the country will have to go to the polls. That would certainly require prolonged negotiations over a new coalition before a government could be formed. It could be into the New Year before the Irish are ready to push the peace process forward. The composition of any new coalition could have wide ramifications for the peace process. All the Irish parties are publicly committed to the process and all have endorsed the Downing Street Declaration that was signed by Mr Reynolds and Mr John Major last December. However, it is widely believed in Dublin that Fianna Fail, a party formed to oppose partition and the 1921 Anglo-Irish Treaty, may be better placed to persuade the hardline republicans of Sinn Fein to go along with a settlement. Mr Reynolds was criticised, even in Dublin, for being over-hasty in embracing the Sinn Fein leaders, greeting Mr Gerry Adams, the party's leader, with a handshake on the steps of Government Buildings less than a week after the IRA ceasefire. However, Mr Reynolds argued that a bold gesture was needed from Dublin to bolster the moderates in the movement. Similar thinking was behind his idea of a cross-party Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, which had its third sitting in Dublin Castle yesterday. There are many officials in Dublin who feel it will be difficult in the short term for a new government to achieve the sort of understanding with Sinn Fein that Mr Reynolds and his top advisers enjoyed. Such rapport may be hard to replicate with a government led by Fine Gael, the main opposition party, a conservative party that is identified historically as the pro-1921 treaty party. With Fianna Fail on the opposition benches, Fine Gael might also find it harder to promote the constitutional change that unionists in the North see as a central part of any settlement. Fianna Fail meets today to elect a new leader to succeed Mr Reynolds. The two names put forward so far are those of outgoing finance minister Mr Bertie Ahern and Justice Minister Mrs Maire Geoghegan-Quinn. Under a new leadership, Fianna Fail may be able to form a new coalition with Labour. The policy programme agreed between the two parties as the basis for the coalition that is now dissolved remains to be completed. However the bitter taste of this week's events will not be easily swallowed. The alternative coalition options may be no easier to put together. Fine Gael, the main opposition party, could form a parliamentary majority with Labour and one of the smaller parties. But relations between Mr Spring and Mr John Bruton, the Fine Gael leader, are described as frosty. Without an early resolution of the political uncertainty, however, progress on the peace process is likely to be impaired.   Countries:-  IEZ  Ireland, EC.     GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

The companies - which include Coal Products, the smokeless fuel manufacturer, and British Fuels Group, the distributor of coal, gas and oil  -last year recorded turnover of more than Pounds 700m and operating profits in excess of Pounds 40m. British Coal would not be drawn on what it expects the proceeds to be. Mr Charles Kernot, mining analyst at Credit Lyonnais Laing, said the companies could fetch more than Pounds 500m, compared with as little as Pounds 130m for coal mines. In addition, British Coal's property portfolio, ranging from the lease on its Hobart House headquarters in London to miners' allotments, could raise between Pounds 300m and Pounds 1bn, according to some forecasts. Mr Ray Proctor, British Coal finance director, said most of the non-mining activities, which employ 4,800 people - a quarter of British Coal's workforce - would be offered by way of trade sales. He hoped privatisation of non-mining businesses would be largely completed by March 1995. British Fuels Group, with an annual turnover of Pounds 550m, is among the largest units being sold. British Coal plans to offer the three BFL arms - GB Coal, GB Oil and Cawoods, serving Northern Ireland - separately towards the end of the year. Coal Products, with turnover of Pounds 130m, may be attractive for its Phurnacite and Homefire brands and its 30 per cent of the UK solid smokeless fuel market. It will be offered for sale early in the summer. British Coal is considering options for the future of CIN Management (Cinman), investment manager for the industry's pension schemes and for the pension funds for Barclays Bank and British Rail. It plans to offer for sale next year its Centris Coal Benefits subsidiary which is taking over the activities, assets and staff of British Coal's pensions administration and insurance centre. More peripheral to the UK industry is German Creek, an Australian company with two deep mines and opencast activities producing between 4m and 5m tonnes a year. British Coal's 15 per cent stake, taken in the late 1970s to give it a testbed for mining technology, is to be offered for sale towards the end of the year. Other activities to be sold include: information technology activities including the Compower computer services bureau; technical and scientific services; and consulting and engineering services to the mining, minerals and energy industries. Several of these are likely to be the subject of management buy-out bids. Potential bidders are being told they can register an interest with Samuel Montagu if they wish to consider bidding for the activities other than Coal Products, on which Price Waterhouse is the adviser. Other organisations still under consideration include British Coal Enterprise, the job-creation arm, and the Coal Research Establishment, which carries out research and development into coal utilisation.

0,FT922-13219 ,"FT922-13219 _AN-CDMAYADBFT 920413   FT  13 APR 92 / IRA again wrongfoots mainland security forces: How bombers slip through the net      By JIMMY BURNS   THE IRA bomb attacks in the heart of the City and on a stretch of road in north London have again demonstrated the capacity of one of the world's best disciplined and determined terrorist organisations to wrongfoot the security forces. Britain's anti-terrorist squad has been in a state of high alert ever since the IRA served notice five weeks ago that it would try to disrupt the general election. The squad believed there was at least one IRA cell on the mainland and that the most likely target would be a senior politician. Its efforts appeared to have been focused on maximising covert protection throughout the campaign. The fact that the IRA only struck only once during the campaign - ineffectually, with a small device in Soho - reflected not so much on the success of the police operation as on the IRA's decision to plan one step ahead. Security experts rule out suggestions that Friday's bomb was a kneejerk reaction to the electoral defeat in West Belfast of Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA. The sheer size of the bombs detonated on Friday suggest the action was planned over weeks and would have involved at least one team of IRA volunteers on surveillance of the area as well as on the assembly and transport of the explosive devices. This team is likely to have been senior to and better organised than the cell responsible for placing less destructive devices such as the one on a railway line on Budget day. Friday's bombs are likely to have been kept in a 'safe house' in London for several days before being transported in vans to their final destinations. The timing of the City bomb in particular suggests that it was placed to coincide with a post-election security lull and to maximise the propaganda effect. During the campaign, City of London police concentrated on protecting buildings in their area and the local MP, Mr Peter Brooke, the outgoing Northern Ireland Secretary. But by Friday night security arrangements were being wound down and the London marathon rather than the IRA was drawing on the limited police resources available at the weekend. There continued to be speculation yesterday that the IRA had intended to bomb the Stock Exchange or Lloyd's - and thus halting business there - while minimising the loss of life. But even given such a miscalculation, hardliners within the IRA will have judged Friday's bomb a success. The response of the City was summed up by Sir Brian Jenkins, lord mayor of London. 'The City of London, confronted with this appalling act, has responded with the vigour you would expect from a major international business centre.' The bomb shook a City that was beginning to celebrate the Conservative victory as well as the prospects of political stability and economic recovery. The two blasts reminded Mr Major that, however much Northern Ireland was ignored as an issue during the election campaign, it will have to remain high on the security and political agenda as long as the IRA maintains its military capability. Some security experts believe the anti-terrorist squad's failure to arrest any of the significant figures in the current mainland campaign - or to avert incidents such as Friday's - point to organisational failings. But, as one senior Special Branch officer admitted during the weekend, there is a thin divide between stepping up security and undermining the democratic system which the police are entrusted to protect. It is such dilemmas which the IRA attempt to exploit.  The Financial Times   London Page 9  "
0,FT944-5506 ,"FT944-5506 _AN-ELDARABEFT 941203   FT  03 DEC 94 / Major attacks separate assemblies      By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor   Labour's plans for a raft of constitutional changes including devolution for Scotland and Wales were yesterday fiercely attacked by Mr John Major, the prime minister. In a speech indicating his determination to put the Tories' defence of the constitutional status quo at the centre of the next election campaign, Mr Major said Labour's commitment to separate assemblies for Scotland and Wales would spell 'the beginning of the end for Britain'. His comments were echoed last night by Mr Michael Portillo, the rightwing employment minister. Underlining the potential for defence of the union to provide a unifying theme across the party, Mr Portillo said the Conservatives were 'first and foremost the party of the United Kingdom'. He added that the people of Northern Ireland were guaranteed the decisive voice in the province's future. The talks with Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, did not mean 'peace at any price'. The prime minister, who also attacked opposition proposals for reform of the House of Lords and a referendum on the voting system for Westminster, said a legislative body in Scotland would be a 'recipe for constitutional chaos'. It would breach 'natural justice' if Scottish MPs were able to vote in a Scottish parliament on issues like health and education and then vote at Westminster on policies affecting the same issues in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. The result would be the break-up of the UK. Speaking at the annual Conference of Conservative Women, Mr Major accused Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader, of considering changes to the first-past-the-post system for electing MPs for narrow political advantage. He told the conference: 'They (Labour) will twist and change the voting system to build an almost permanent alliance between Labour and the Liberals with one purpose and with one purpose above all - to try and keep the Conservative party out.' Mr Major added that Labour's attacks on the Lords were designed to attract 'a few cheap cheers'. He went on: 'The fact is that the House of Lords works rather well. It is an important brake on over-mighty government, an important part of our constitution - and it is a good deal more popular, by and large, than the House of Commons.' He said that Labour's proposals would make the Britain which has existed for the past 300 years unrecognisable.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

In an interview at Stormont Castle, Belfast, yesterday, Sir  Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, restated the British  Government's refusal to embrace Sinn Fein in the search for a  political solution until the IRA ended violence permanently.    With ministers acutely aware that Sinn Fein has scored  another propaganda victory in Mr Adams' U.S. visit, Sir  Patrick's uncompromising position was endorsed by Mr John Major,  the prime minister, in the Commons. In New York, Mr Douglas  Hurd, Foreign Secretary, said Mr Adams' remarks had been  characterised by ""ambiguity and evasion.""    The U.S. administration also moved quickly to emphasise that  its decision to admit Mr Adams on a 48-hour visa did not reflect  policy differences with the British government over Northern  Ireland.    President Bill Clinton, rejecting calls for more U.S.  pressure on Britain, said at a press conference: ""Let's be  fair. The people that have to resolve this are the Irish and  the British."" He described the peace initiative taken by Mr  Major and Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, as  ""astonishing"" and said Mr Adams should back it.    Sir Patrick dismissed Mr Adams' renewed calls for  clarification as delaying tactics.    After a briefing to members of the congressional committee  on  Irish affairs, Mr Adams said he was anxious to find a proposal  to put to the IRA to end its conflict. ""The ball is firmly in  the British court,"" he said. Mr Adams repeated his calls for  British government action when he addressed the national  committee on American foreign policy.    But Sir Patrick, who said it was ""a pity"" that Mr Adams had  been given a platform in the U.S., insisted that it was Sinn  Fein which had ""the key"" to a peaceful solution. He said: ""The  only rational choice for a organisation that has a political  objective is to accede to the declaration, end violence and make  it clear that you have ended violence, and then make use of what  has been offered, Sinn Fein has the key. The key is their  ability to give up violence.""    Referring to the Sinn Fein president's recent letter to Mr  Major, Sir Patrick said that it ""did not seek any clarification  or explanation of any specific matter at all. It is entirely  clear that what he wants is a renegotiation of the declaration.""    He claimed that Mr Adams' continuing refusal to be specific  meant that there was no ""genuine request for enlightenment and  the most likely candidate for an alternative explanation is the  desire to play for time.""    Mr Adams, in calling on the government for talks on the  mechanics of a negotiated settlement, said: ""Mr Major has talked  of a first step in the peace process. What is the second step  and the third step?"" He said peace would be difficult to  establish but prospects were better than ever before.     "

""There is a lot of trepidation to say the least,"" said one  officer. ""It is a very major, in-depth review and will impact  dramatically on all serving personnel."" Servicemen fear their  military status may mean that, unlike the police, they have no  redress.    The review, announced at the weekend by the Chief of the  Defence Staff, will take about a year, starting in the spring.  It will be conducted by an independent chairman and up to five  independent members, yet to be named. It is described by the  Ministry of Defence as a major review of ""service career and  manpower structures, and terms and conditions of service."" This  is taken to include such issues as the extent of unaccompanied  service for married men -- for example in Northern Ireland --  overseas allowances and subsidised schooling.    The review has been launched in the context of a three-year  efficiency drive to meet Treasury demands for further cuts in  the defence budget.     "
0,FT941-14010 ,"FT941-14010 _AN-EAWARABLFT 940122   FT  22 JAN 94 / Sinn Fein delivers stinging blow to hopes for peace      By DAVID OWEN and IVOR OWEN   Hopes of an early end to the IRA's 25-year campaign of violence in Ulster suffered a fresh blow last night as Sinn Fein responded scathingly to new efforts by London and Dublin to breathe life into their peace initiative. Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, said the only positive aspect about an attempt by Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, to reassure nationalists about last month's Downing Street declaration was the recognition that clarification could be appropriate in future. Mr Adams described the declaration as 'a masterpiece of ambiguity'. He said it was absurd that the UK government would not 'supply the request for clarification that has been put to them in quite reasonable terms by me'. His remarks reawakened fears that a prolonged stand-off between the two camps was in prospect. Mr Adams insisted, however, that the political wing of the IRA was not 'searching for a 'no''. Sinn Fein was 'not going to allow the British government to squander this opportunity for peace'. He told Channel 4 News: 'It's not exactly the best government the British people have had to rule them. It's a very dismal government on many domestic counts and no different in terms of its dealing with the question of Ireland.' His remarks followed the delivery of a firm rebuff from Downing Street to Sinn Fein's demand for direct dialogue on the declaration. Downing Street accused Mr Adams of seeking to 'reopen issues for renegotiation' in a letter sent to the prime minister earlier this month. Publishing both this original letter and a terse response signed by a senior government official, Downing Street told Mr Adams that there was 'no question' of the joint declaration being renegotiated. 'That text, and only that text, is what is at issue,' it said. Mr Adams reacted angrily, accusing Mr John Major of 'a patently obvious attempt to frustrate a genuine effort to end the stand-off'. The release of the letters coincided with a Commons debate in which Sir Patrick said Sinn Fein had given no 'particulars' of what it wanted clarified. Talk of clarification was 'but a smokescreen to distract attention' from whether 'all those now engaged in violence' would renounce it. Drawing on an earlier speech seeking to reassure nationalists and unionists, Sir Patrick said the aspiration of a united Ireland by peaceful means was 'fully legitimate'. He hinted that Britain's broadcasting ban on Sinn Fein would be lifted only if republican leaders renounced terrorism. Sinn Fein has said it will make no formal response to the Downing Street declaration until at least the end of next month.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.     IEZ  Ireland, EC.

By GRAHAME L. JONES, TIMES STAFF WRITER      FLORENCE, Italy      It is one of the most memorable and, indeed, poignant photographs in World Cup  history. It shows a player on his knees on the turf, his face buried in his  hands. The emotion it conveys is almost palpable.    The shot was taken at Wembley Stadium in London on the afternoon of July 30,  1966, the day that England defeated West Germany, 4-2, in overtime, to win the  World Cup.    The player in the picture is Jack Charlton.    ""I suddenly realized that I was knackered (exhausted, to use a more polite  euphemism),"" Charlton said years later in explaining the photograph. ""Really  knackered. I sank on my knees and put my head in my hands. A sort of, 'Thank  God that's over.' People reckon I said a little prayer, but I don't think I  actually said a conscious prayer. It was just relief at the end of two hours of  football.""    Whatever the reason, the photograph dramatically captures the pressures of  playing in the World Cup and its effect on those involved.    In 1966, Charlton and his more famous brother, Bobby, helped England win the  trophy for the first and so far only time. In 1990, ""Big Jack"" is trying to do  the same for Ireland.    An Englishman coaching the Irish might seem an unlikely, almost incongruous,  situation, but there are all sorts of twists in this English lion's tale.    For one thing, Charlton is looked upon almost as a saint in the republic after  leading Ireland into both the European Championships in 1988 and the World Cup  this year for the first time in its history. For another, he genuinely likes  the Irish and has developed a true rapport with the country's soccer  supporters.    ""If we can't win the World Cup, then I would like England to be the champions,""  Charlton told fans in Dublin before the team left for Italy, then paused just  long enough before adding: ""But they'll do it over our dead bodies.""    Indeed, since Charlton took over as Ireland's coach in February 1986, the  English have found the Irish a particularly troublesome opponent.    Ireland played England in the first round of the European Championships in West  Germany in 1988 and scored a memorable 1-0 upset victory. The teams met again  10 days ago in Cagliari on the island of Sardinia, this time in World Cup play,  and the Irish earned a 1-1 tie.    ""Beating England in West Germany was the high point of Ireland's soccer history  so far,"" British soccer reporter Peter Ball wrote just before the World Cup,  ""and Charlton was virtually canonized on the spot by the traveling Irish fans  and feted almost unbelievably when the side returned home, confirming his  status as an honorary Irishman.    ""There are still critics who do not love his approach to the game, but his  rapport with fans is tremendous, and when Ireland qualified (for the World  Cup), an emotional Charlton joined the celebrating fans in the streets and the  bars as they drank the night away.""    Oddly enough, England and Ireland have since been drawn together for the third  time in a row in international competition and will meet in the qualifying  rounds of the 1992 European Championships.    But for now, the focus is on the World Cup and, in particular, on today's match  in Palermo, Sicily, between Ireland and the Netherlands. Odds favor the Dutch,  but this has been a World Cup of upsets, and there is one other factor to  remember: Charlton has never lost a World Cup match as a player or as a coach.    As the second-oldest player on England's 1966 team, Charlton, then 29, played  in and won six games. Inexplicably, he played in only one match in the 1970  World Cup in Mexico, but England won that game, too. Now, at 54, he has coached  Ireland to consecutive ties against England and Egypt.    Even though he has been actively involved in the game since signing as a  16-year-old professional with Leeds United of the English League in 1952,  Charlton's life revolves around more than soccer.    As Ball wrote, ""There is more to Jack Charlton than the Ireland manager would  like you to think. Behind the bluff, sometimes rough exterior lies a surprising  sensitivity; but then, behind the decisive, no-nonsense front there is a mass  of contradictions: a socialist with a taste for shooting and fishing, if not  hunting.""    Indeed, there are times when it seems that Charlton has an even greater passion  for tramping the moors in search of grouse, a shotgun tucked under his arm, or  for fly-fishing along some Irish river bank than he has for soccer. He made a  notable television series on fishing -- and another on soccer coaching -- and  is a popular television pundit and after-dinner speaker despite his broad  north-of-England accent.    But soccer has been his bread and butter for almost four decades. At 6 feet 4  and gawky, long in neck and stride, he was a soccer-playing giraffe. His height  helped him be almost unbeatable in the air, however, and it was as a defender  that he made his mark.    He played a club-record 629 matches for Leeds United, his only club team, and  appeared 35 times for England. He was named England's player of the year in  1967 and, after moving into coaching -- first with Middlesbrough, then with  Sheffield Wednesday and, briefly, with Newcastle United -- he was named  England's coach of the year in 1974.    But it is with Ireland that Charlton has enjoyed his greatest success.  Consider:     -- A survey by a Scottish soccer magazine, The Punter, late last year ranked  Ireland ahead of England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales, based on the  results of all international matches played since 1986. Ireland, in fact,  ranked fourth in Europe, behind only the Netherlands, West Germany and Denmark.  Italy was fifth.     -- Coming into the World Cup, the Irish were unbeaten at home in four years.     -- In his first three years as Ireland's coach, Charlton won 13 matches, tied  seven and lost only five. Small wonder that the Irish Football Assn. was quick  to renew its agreement with him.    It was not a written contract, however. True to character, Charlton works on a  handshake, a gentlemen's agreement that requires nothing more than the other  party's word.    If there is one criticism of Charlton, it is that his team's style of play  tends to be more effective than attractive. This practical approach reflects  Charlton's temperament.    The best example of Ireland's style was shown in the match against England. The  Irish were quick into every tackle, unafraid of physical contact and aggressive  for the full 90 minutes.    ""We inflict our game on other teams -- let them try to handle us,"" Charlton  said of Ireland's approach during the World Cup qualifying campaign. So far, it  has worked, but the future is less certain.    British sports columnist James Mossop has been a close friend of Charlton's for  almost a quarter-century. In an article in England's Sunday Express on June 10  he wrote:    ""Charlton is looking to the future, and in two years' time he will be gone from  the stewardship of the Republic of Ireland team. Retirement calls at 54.    ""You would not guess as much from a glance at the training ground where he  barks instructions with the epithets of the Northumbrian colliery where his  working life began. He is a tall, bandy-legged figure in baggy shorts, vest,  dark glasses and the kind of tweed cap favored by pigeon fanciers and  rat-catchers.""    The image is almost like something out of D.H. Lawrence, and Charlton, in fact,  does come across as the no-nonsense northerner -- gruff, blunt and sparing no  punches -- that Lawrence favored.    Added Mossop: ""Jack is a straightforward, uncomplicated person who will say  exactly what he thinks. Usually instantly.""    This, Charlton believes, might have cost him any chance at becoming England's  coach several years ago. He applied, but never heard back from the English  Football Assn.    ""Perhaps they didn't think I was couth enough or that my image was right,"" he  told Mossop. ""I have a reputation for being outspoken. I do not consider myself  a diplomat, but there are too many diplomats knocking about in the game.""    And so tonight, instead of guiding England's fortunes against Egypt in  Cagliari, Charlton will be in Palermo, hoping to upstage the English by beating  the Dutch. It's unlikely to happen, but Charlton will be there by choice.    ""I love the Irish people and the job,"" he said. ""At this moment, I have no  ambition other than managing the Irish team. I know the time will come when I  will get the feeling that I should go and someone else should have a crack at  it. You can spend too much time in a job.""    A postscript: On Nov. 15, 1989, in front of 25,000 fans, one-fifth of them  Irish, at Ta Qali National Stadium in Valletta, Malta, Ireland defeated Malta,  2-0.    The victory was historic. Ireland had been trying for 56 years to reach the  World Cup but had failed in its previous 12 attempts. Charlton got it right the  first time as Ireland finished second to Spain in its qualifying group, which  also included Hungary and Malta.    ""The satisfaction for me is doing the job I was paid to do in the first place,""  Charlton said afterward. ""When I took over (as coach), it was made clear that  the main aim was to qualify for the (24-team) finals.    ""The European Championship was nice, and we've upgraded our game and caused  people a few problems over the years. But I'm glad it's over. We've had two  very difficult years and we've had to win a few games when the pressure has  been on. But (the players) have done that, and it's absolutely terrific that  Ireland is in the finals for the first time.""    That said, Charlton made his exit. His roots and his heart lie with the players  and the fans, not the sportswriters and the television cameras. It was a night  to celebrate, and as he left, Charlton tossed one last comment back over his  shoulder: ""The lads are singing, and I want to join them.""    Those 10 words, as well as any, illustrate what Jack Charlton is all about.

0,FT943-3644 ,"FT943-3644 _AN-EIMDOAECFT 940913   FT  13 SEP 94 / UVF admits bombing Dublin railway station: Britain fears loyalist violence could threaten ceasefire      By JOHN MURRAY BROWN,  and KEVIN BROWN      BELFAST,, LONDON   The prospect of an early end to Irish political violence receded yesterday as the outlawed Ulster Volunteer Force admitted bombing a Dublin railway station. The bombing was condemned as 'revolting' by Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, reflecting British concern that loyalist violence could threaten the open-ended IRA ceasefire announced last month. Mr Pat Doherty, a senior official of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, accused the UVF of trying to force the Dublin government to abandon direct contacts with republicans. 'The loyalist hope is that fear of the conflict being brought 'down here' will scupper the peace process,' he said. Mr John Hume, leader of the moderate nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party, said he was confident the IRA would not retaliate because Sinn Fein's leadership was 'totally committed' to the peace process. Mrs Maire Geoghegan-Quinn, the Irish justice minister, said the attack would not deflect the Dublin government from its strategy of consolidating the republican ceasefire by talking directly to Sinn Fein. British officials believe the US is likely to grant a visa to Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, at the Irish government's request, as part of the Irish strategy of drawing Sinn Fein into mainstream politics. However, Downing Street believes President Clinton and administration officials will avoid a direct meeting with Mr Adams for fear of weakening unionist support for the peace process. The Dublin bomb exploded as an express train from Belfast was pulling into Connolly station in the city centre. Two women were slightly hurt. Irish police said the explosion was caused by a detonator which failed to ignite a 2kg explosive charge, suggesting that casualties could have been higher. The UVF, which bombed a Dublin pub three months ago, said it had planted bombs in seven other locations in the city. None was found. The bombing reflects loyalist suspicion of a deal between Britain and the IRA, and confirms that Protestant terrorists are prepared to take their campaign to the Irish Republic. The Combined Loyalist Military Command, representing the UVF and the Ulster Freedom Fighters said last week a loyalist ceasefire would depend on assurances that no deal had been done. Loyalists are also concerned about the implications of a 'framework' document for Northern Ireland's future being drawn up by the British and Irish governments as part of the peace process.

Mr John Major and Mr Albert Reynolds met at Chequers yesterday, accompanied by Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, and Mr Dick Spring, Irish foreign minister After the meeting, the two prime ministers said they had made 'steady progress' in the framework document intended to promote talks involving Ulster's main constitutional parties. But the two men acknowledged that sticking-points remained and declined to set a date for the document's completion. 'There are still some very important issues that remain to be resolved,' Mr Major said. Mr Reynolds said: 'You can take it that the gap (between the two sides) is narrower after today's meeting than it was yesterday.' Officials will continue talks today on what Mr Major described as the 'logistics and mechanics' of arranging for weapons in the hands of paramilitaries to be handed over. Acknowledging that there were 'self-evident difficulties' in the process, partly because weapons were hidden in Ulster and the Irish Republic, Mr Major said: 'Clearly it is desirable to have a co-ordinated approach.' He declined to say whether the handing over of weapons was likely to begin in advance of talks between the government and Sinn Fein before the end of the year. The IRA has not yet agreed to hand over any weapons. Questioned on his remarks last week, which appeared to irritate Dublin, that plans for an Ulster assembly were separate from the framework document, Mr Major said it would be a 'misreading' to suggest he was trying to detach one from the other. The process is seen as falling into three 'strands'. One covers the assembly; strand two concerns north and south relations; and strand three covers relations between London and Dublin. Mr Major said on Friday that the framework document would cover strands two and three. Mr Reynolds declined to say whether he would push for changes in the Irish constitution, which enshrines Dublin's territorial claim to Ulster. Mr Major is thought to have told his Irish counterpart that hopes for a settlement depended on a revision of this claim. Moderate unionists, whose support is vital to efforts to forge a settlement, are expected to insist on such a move. Ulster spending plea, Page 9   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

0,FT941-11835 ,"FT941-11835 _AN-EBBDOAE2FT 940202   FT  02 FEB 94 / Government rejects Adams call for Ulster peace deal clarification      By MICHAEL CASSELL and PATRICK HARVERSON      BELFAST, NEW YORK   The British government last night rejected demands in New York by Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, for clarification on the Anglo-Irish joint declaration and for negotiations on a political settlement in Northern Ireland. In an interview at Stormont Castle, Belfast, yesterday, Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, restated the British government's refusal to embrace Sinn Fein in the search for a political solution until the IRA ended violence permanently. With ministers acutely aware that Sinn Fein has scored another propaganda victory in Mr Adams' US visit, Sir Patrick's uncompromising position was endorsed by Mr John Major, the prime minister, in the Commons. In New York, Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, said Mr Adams' remarks had been characterised by 'ambiguity and evasion'. The US administration also moved quickly to emphasise that its decision to admit Mr Adams on a 48-hour visa did not reflect policy differences with the British government over Northern Ireland. President Bill Clinton, rejecting calls for more US pressure on Britain, said at a press conference: 'Let's be fair. The people that have to resolve this are the Irish and the British.' He described the peace initiative taken by Mr Major and Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, as 'astonishing' and said Mr Adams should back it. Sir Patrick dismissed Mr Adams' renewed calls for clarification as delaying tactics. After a briefing to members of the congressional committee on Irish affairs, Mr Adams said he was anxious to find a proposal to put to the IRA to enable it to end its conflict. 'The ball is firmly in the British court,' he said. Mr Adams repeated his calls for British government action when he addressed the national committee on American foreign policy. But Sir Patrick, who said it was 'a pity' that Mr Adams had been given a platform in the US, insisted that it was Sinn Fein which had 'the key' to a peaceful solution. He said: 'The only rational choice for an organisation that has a political objective is to accede to the declaration, end violence and make it clear that you have ended violence, and then make use of what has been offered. Sinn Fein has the key. The key is their ability to give up violence.' Referring to the Sinn Fein president's recent letter to Mr Major, Sir Patrick said that it 'did not seek any clarification or explanation of any specific matter at all. It is entirely clear that what he wants is a renegotiation of the declaration.' He claimed that Mr Adams' continuing refusal to be specific meant that there was no 'genuine request for enlightenment and the most likely candidate for an alternative explanation is the desire to play for time'. Mr Adams, in calling on the government for talks on the mechanics of a negotiated settlements, said: 'Mr Major has talked of a first step in the peace process. What is the second step and the third step?' He said peace would be difficult to establish but prospects were better than ever before. The IRA fired a 150lb mortar bomb at troops close to the Irish border today. Nobody was hurt. Observer, Page 19   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.     IEZ  Ireland, EC.

Asked in a BBC interview whether he would pick up the recent  suggestion of Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland  Secretary, that Sinn Fein requests for clarification of the  declaration might be considered by London, Mr Adams said:  ``We're exploring that, and I won't say I am hopeful.    ``I have always said we would be flexible in allowing them  to  get off the hook which they got themselves on to on  clarification. We don't want any big public climbdown by them.  We are pursuing the issue.''    It was unclear whether Mr Adams was about to submit a list  of  questions to the British Government, detailing the points on  which Sinn Fein or the IRA wanted clarification.    Albert Reynolds, Irish Prime Minister, said last week: ``I  would hope that we would be able to draw the process of  clarification to a conclusion shortly, because there is, in my  opinion, not a great deal more that can be said at this stage.''    That statement was read as a warning to Sinn Fein that Mr  Reynolds' patience was running out. The Taoiseach [Irish prime  minister] is known to have sent a 16-page letter of  clarification to Sinn Fein last February. But London and Dublin  sources said last week political talks were going ahead -- with  or without Sinn Fein.    THE OBSERVER has been told that the Republicans have more or  less completed their analysis of the Downing Street Declaration.  Those dedicated to assessing it are now working on other  issues, according to a senior Sinn Fein source.    That disclosure came at the end of a week of bloodletting in  Northern Ireland in which 10 people died, four of them killed by  the IRA.    In the latest incident yesterday morning, the UFF [Ulster  Freedom Fighters] shot and critically wounded a 39-year-old  Catholic security man at the Valley Business Centre in  Newtonabbey.    The body of a man, killed by the IRA and dumped on  Newry/Omeath Road in South Down on Friday afternoon, was  recovered by the security forces yesterday.    The IRA named him as Martin Brown, from Downpatrick, and  alleged that he was an RUC [Royal Ulster Constabulary] Special  Branch informer. The man, who had his hands tied behind his  back and was shot in the head, was the tenth person to be  murdered by the paramilitaries in nine days.    Until last Sunday, when John McCloy and Alan Smith (both  Protestants) were killed in Garvagh, south Londonderry, the IRA  had exclusively targeted members of the security forces since  the publication of the declaration. One Republican said: ""It's  back to business as usual for the IRA, I suppose.""    Meanwhile, it emerged yesterday that last week's claim by  the  Government that the IRA had held secret meetings with the  Iranian secret intelligence service, the MOIS, had followed a  joint operation involving all three elements of Britain's secret  world: MI5, MI6 and GCHQ [Government Communication Headquarters].    It was co-ordinated by MI5, which has had ""lead  responsibility"" for combating Irish terrorism since last year.  MI5 directed the operation, with MI6 conducting surveillance in  several European cities.    It is understood vital parts of a picture described by  Whitehall sources as a ""patchwork quilt"" of intelligence emerged  from the bugging of international telephone and fax messages by  GCHQ in Cheltenham.    The decision to make the intelligence public was taken by  politicians on MI5 advice. The service considered the prospects  of prosecuting any of those involved were remote: the meetings  took place on foreign soil; several of those involved from Iran  had diplomatic immunity; and it would have been almost  impossible to put together a viable case relating to any  specific criminal offence. Therefore it was decided to disrupt  the link by publicising it.    It is understood Iran has already made cash donations to the  IRA through Sinn Fein, but the sums involved are small. In the  IRA-MOIS meetings, much bigger donations were discussed,  together with weapons shipments.    The IRA representatives were known quartermasters with  experience in the international arms market. It is believed  their work was sanctioned by the Army Council.     "

Some warned that the anger of the pro-European Tory MPs  could  be held back, but only until after the European elections. They  denied they were the new ""Euro-bastards"", but their patience is  growing thin.    Some are threatening to break cover if the Tory manifesto  for  the European elections is Euro-sceptic in tone.    ""Euro-enthusiasts"" angrily accused Michael Portillo of  mounting a leadership bid with his own agenda on Europe.  Officers of the group privately demanded a firm rebuke from  John Major. ""If he doesn't stop Portillo now, his leadership is  finished,"" a senior member said. One ministerial source said:  ""Every time he fails to slap them down, he lets the  Euro-sceptics move a step further.""    They rejected the Euro-sceptics' allegation that  pro-Europeans are now a tiny party minority and had become a  mirror image of ""bastards"" who opposed Maastricht.    The only member of the group to attack Mr Portillo publicly  was Hugh Dykes, who accused him of breaching policy by openly  opposing a single European currency.    The group claims the support of about 80 Tory MPs. None of  its leaders is a natural trouble-maker. They include Ray  Whitney, a former minister; Ian Taylor, parliamentary aide to  William Waldegrave; Emma Nicholson, another parliamentary aide;  Ralph Howell, a senior backbencher; and Jacqui Lait, MP for  Hastings.    Backbench supporters include party stalwarts such as Sir  Geoffrey Johnson-Smith, an officer of the 1922 Committee, Tom  King, former Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, and Graham  Bright, the Prime Minister's Parliamentary aide. Other founding  members have been promoted by Mr Major as ministers, including  Michael Ancram and Sir John Wheeler, both Northern Ireland  ministers.    The most ardent pro-Europeans -- Mr Dykes, David Madel,  David  Knox and Robert Hicks -- are also members of Nick's Diner, the  wets' dining club. Some privately admit their problem is that  they are seen as ""wet"" and unlikely to cause the difficulty for  Mr Major that the anti-Maastricht ""bastards"" did. But if they  sense they are losing the battle for Europe, that will be the  point at which the pro-Europeans adopt the tactics of the  ""bastards.""     "

In an interview in Boston yesterday with THE IRISH TIMES, Mr  Reynolds said it was futile to talk in isolation about removing  the constitutional claim to the North and that there had to be a  balanced constitutional agreement. Spelling out for the first  time what this means, Mr Reynolds said: ""Institutional links  between North and South will have executive powers. That's the  type of overall framework we're looking to.""    He said there was still a ""fair bit of work to be done"" in  the talks between officials from Dublin and London, but he was  hopeful he and British Prime Minister, Mr John Major, could  achieve their aim of agreement by mid-July.    Mr Reynolds was in Boston to receive the Christian A. Herter  Memorial Award from the World Affairs Council of Boston for his  role in the peace process.    President Clinton sent a message of congratulations to Mr  Reynolds who, he said, had earned the respect and admiration of  world leaders for his contribution to peace.    In his acceptance speech, Mr Reynolds laid stress on the  need  for a balanced constitutional accommodation. New arrangements,  he said, ""must provide a clear and explicit institutional  framework for the development of the necessary North-South  co-operation and co- ordination in areas of mutual benefit.""    Expanding on this in his interview, Mr Reynolds said there  had to be an even-handed approach in the negotiations with  Britain and therefore the Government of Ireland Act 1920 and  Articles 2 and 3 should be on the table ""for negotiation both  ways.""    ""That's the Act that set up partition in the first place,  but  it also had the intentions of the British Government at the time  to move on towards eventual unity of Ireland, and that (in the  meantime) intermediate steps would be taken,"" he said.    Asked if he was seeking a quid pro quo involving some type  of  cross-border authority with executive powers in return for the  dropping of Articles 2 and 3, Mr Reynolds said: ""Those are the  type of areas we are exploring between the two governments at  the moment. What I'm saying is institutional links between North  and South will have executive powers. That's the type of  overall framework we're looking to, but that emanates clearly  from the contents of the Downing Street Declaration.""    Mr Reynolds acknowledged that unionists might view this as a  form of the Council of Ireland which they had strongly rejected  in the past.    In the declaration, ""we make it clear that there has to be a  wider settlement involving other relationships, internal  relationships in Northern Ireland, North-South co-operation and  an institutional framework to reflect the diversity of the two  parts and between the islands of Ireland and Great Britain.""    On the role of the United States, Mr Reynolds said the  message from the United States to the nationalists was: ""We're  here to support you but we're not here to support any  continuation of violence. Give up the violence and you can rely  on us for our support to see that the cause is not ignored and  that whatever commitments are given will be implemented.""    Mr Reynolds continued: ""That's a very important guarantor  situation for the United States and the people in the United  States to have taken up."" He said he now expected a response  from Sinn Fein to the Downing Street Declaration by ""the early  days of July, if not before.""     "

Home Office and Customs and Excise officials told the committee that, leaving Northern Ireland aside, hundreds of crime syndicates were involved in everything from extortion and lorry hijacking to drugs. But there was no dominant group like the Mafia in Italy. The main operators in the UK were often tentacles of international syndicates like the Mafia, the Triads and the Colombian cartels. These groups, increasingly joined by gangs from the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, are often involved in drug trafficking and money laundering. Estimating the extent of organised crime is hampered by the lack of a broad definition in UK law of organised crime  - such as that in the US law against racketeering. Officials defined organised crime as a group activity whose prime purpose is the achievement of large-scale profits through criminal acts, which is long-term and continuing and includes some form of self-perpetuating criminal structure. Home Office officials estimated that between Pounds 2.5bn and Pounds 4bn was laundered in the UK in 1992. Customs and Excise officials estimated that in the year to April 1993, the value of drugs prevented from entering the UK was Pounds 896m. There were about 9,000 drug seizures and 47 drug rings were broken up.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P92   Justice, Public Order, and Safety.   Types:-  NEWS  General News.

0,FT931-15061 ,"FT931-15061 _AN-DANCOACRFT 930114   FT  14 JAN 93 / (CORRECTED) Patronage determines who serves at the top      By JOHN WILLMAN and STEPHEN COURT   Correction (Published 15th January 1993) appended to this article THE GROWTH in power and influence of quangos puts responsibility for many of the UK's public services in the hands of the unelected members of their boards. Since 1979 there have been numerous accusations that the Conservatives have used patronage to appoint Tory supporters to key quango jobs, particularly in health services. In the latest row Mr Ron Davies, shadow Welsh secretary, this week accused the government of 'deliberately stuffing public bodies and authorities (in Wales) with Tory placemen'. That follows the appointment last year of former Tory MP Mr Ian Grist - who lost Cardiff Central in the general election - as chairman of South Glamorgan health authority. Analysis by the the Financial Times of the chairmen of the 10 largest NHS quangos and the 30 largest non-NHS quangos in 1990-91 shows that, if they had an identifiable political affiliation, it was Conservative. None of the top 40 was a known Labour party member or Liberal Democrat, while eight were Conservatives. Among prominent Tories is the former Mr Nicholas Edwards, now Lord Crickhowell, a former Welsh secretary. He now chairs the National Rivers Authority; and Mr David Mitchell of Cumbernauld Development Corporation, who is treasurer of the Scottish Conservative party. Sir Bryan Askew, who chairs Yorkshire Regional Health Authority, was a Conservative parliamentary candidate. The last Labour government also used its patronage powers to appoint supporters to key posts in top quangos. Twelve of the top 40 chairmen in 1978-79 were Labour supporters, including Labour peers Lord Northfield and Lord Campbell. Supporters of other political parties also chaired top quangos. Three were known Conservatives and one a Liberal. There have been other changes in the type of people running top quangos in the 14 years since the Conservatives came to power. The most striking is the move away from appointing professional public-sector managers. Today's top quango chairman is much more likely to be a businessman - nearly two thirds of the chairmen of top 40 quangos in 1990-91 were from business and industry. It was one third in 1978-79. Some of those businessmen have headed large public companies. Sir Alistair Grant, chairman and chief executive of Argyll Group, is chairman of the Agricultural and Food Research Council. Sir David Nickson of Scottish and Newcastle Breweries, Sir David Plastow of Vickers and Sir Clifford Chetwood of George Wimpey also chair top 40 quangos. Others come from smaller businesses or have not headed their own company boards. Sir James Ackers, who last week resigned as chairman of West Midlands regional health authority, the biggest-spending NHS quango, ran a family truck-rental business which collapsed last year. Sir Bryan Askew is personnel director for brewers Samuel Smiths. The appointment of more businessmen has been matched by a fall in the number of chairmen who come from the 'great and the good'. In 1978-79, nine of the top 40 quangos were chaired by someone whose main occupation was serving on public bodies. Only two fell into that category in 1990-91, Baroness Cumberlege of the South West Thames RHA - who has since become a minister - and Mr John McEvoy, who chairs the Northern Ireland Housing Executive. The FT study also shows that the top 40 quango chairmen in 1990-91 were not representative of the people for whom they provided public services. They were overwhelmingly male, with only two women among the top 40. Of the 22 whose schools could be identified, 18 went to public schools. They were mostly university-educated, eight at Oxford or Cambridge. If there is a new elite running Britain's public services, as the European Policy Foundation alleges, it appears the best qualifications to join are to be a businessman with Conservative leanings.

0,FT942-8561 ,"FT942-8561 _AN-EETCSAAJFT 940520   FT  20 MAY 94 / Retail sales defy tax increases: Treasury 'wise men' upbeat on recovery - Bank warns against rate cut      By GILLIAN TETT and PHILIP COGGAN   Signs that Britain's economic recovery is withstanding April's tax increases were reinforced yesterday after an unexpected rise in monthly retail sales and an upbeat verdict from Treasury advisers. But although figures from the Central Statistical Office strengthened the picture of subdued price rises, Mr Eddie George, the Bank of England governor, further damped hopes of an interest rate cut, stressing that now was not the time 'to take risks on the side of inflation'. Retail sales volumes rose a seasonally adjusted 0.4 per cent in April, compared with March, and 4.4 per cent year-on-year. The British Retail Consortium, the main industry body, said preliminary reports from retailers indicated that the rise was continuing this month. The figures surprised the City, which had predicted that April's tax increases, coupled with the impact of an early Easter holiday, would depress consumer spending. Meanwhile, the Treasury said there was now a 'steady upward trend in retail sales, which is further evidence of economic recovery'. However, it warned that it was still too early to assess the full impact of April's tax rises on consumer spending. Analysts stressed that the real impact would not be known until the summer, when the full range of tax increases began to bite into households' monthly budgets. A report from the so-called 'wise men', the Treasury's panel of independent forecasters, predicted that the recovery would withstand the tax rise, and that growth in gross domestic product would be 2.9 per cent this year - ahead of the government's forecast - and 2.8 per cent in 1995. But although this optimistic message was supported by yesterday's sales data, City analysts doubted whether the seasonal adjustment used in calculating April's figure had accurately reflected the fact that Easter - and the heavy pre-Easter shopping week - had occurred in March, not April, this year. The CSO admitted this meant 'there was more uncertainty surrounding the figures than usual'. But the three-month figures, generally regarded as the more accurate indicator of trends, showed that retail sales' volumes rose by 1 per cent between February and April, compared with the previous three months. The data also underlined the low level of retail inflation, with the total value of sales virtually unchanged between March and April, in spite of the volume growth. Nevertheless, Mr George warned against the danger of further cuts in interest rates. Speaking to the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce, he warned against easing policy 'in anticipation of a weakening of activity . . . which may not materialise'. The governor pointed to the rise in average earnings, announced on Wednesday, as a dangerous sign of inflationary expectations. His caution was echoed by the Treasury panel, four of whom said they saw little need for a change in interest rates. However, all bar one of the six panellists expect underlying inflation, which excludes mortgage interest payments, to remain within the government's target range this year and next.

There will be grounds  for accusing the Dublin government of folly, if not mischief, in  pressing Britain so hard to extend the written dialogue with the  Republicans.    For now, Sir Patrick's explanation -- that merely answering  questions does not represent the ""clarification"" which he and Mr  Major ruled out when Sinn Fein first responded to the Downing  Street Declaration -- seems narrowly tenable. The original  demand for ""clarification"" seemed to mean negotiation in all but  name -- an impression borne out by Mr Adams's refusal to say  exactly what he wanted -- while the IRA continued to exert  pressure by means of terrorism.    If Mr Adams is still merely playing for time, further  disingenuous inquiries will no doubt be forthcoming from Sinn  Fein, designed to inch the Government ever closer to the  negotiating table. The form of some of Sinn Fein's current  questions invites such suspicion. For instance, ""What are the  means and within what time does Britain expect to see agreement  reached between all the Irish people?"" is tantamount to  demanding a timetable for a united Ireland. On this and other  points, Mr Adams should be directed towards the relevant  passages of the Declaration. The Government cannot prudently go  further, in advance of a permanent IRA cease-fire.    There remains the possibility, however, that Britain's  uncompromising tactics have started to bear fruit. Sinn Fein  may at last realise that negotiation is unattainable without a  cease-fire. Answers to his questions may enable Mr Adams, who is  alleged to be among the Sinn Fein ""peace party"", to win over  some of the more militant IRA cadres without losing face. If  Sir Patrick is merely issuing prolix statements of the obvious,  thereby assisting Mr Adams to get off the hook on which he has  publicly impaled himself, the risk he is taking might yet prove  worthwhile.    Dublin's position is less straight-forward. By adding its  own voice to Mr Adams's request for answers from Sir Patrick,  the Irish government has chosen to vouch for the good faith of  this latest initiative. But the Irish government's agreement to  use its influence with Britain in this way imposes a duty to  apply equal pressure in the other direction. As we have said  before, Dublin's principal responsibility now is to use its  weight to educate and moderate Nationalist and Republican  sentiment, in Ireland and elsewhere, while not upsetting, Ulster  Unionist opinion. In the wake of Sir Patrick's replies, Dublin  must move to assure Irish and world opinion that Britain will  have done all it could reasonably be expected to do.     "

Mr Nigel Smyth, director of the CBI in the province, said: 'We have to welcome any statement that reflects people's will to stop violence, and hope it is permanent.' Mr Denis Galway, senior vice-president of the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said the ceasefire would contribute to business confidence, tourist development and international investment. Mr Frank Caddy, chief executive of the Belfast Chamber of Trade, said city traders were looking forward to attracting more leading high street names. The atmosphere in Belfast city centre had changed since the IRA called its ceasefire and he expected it to get even better. 'The pace has slowed down, people are stopping and looking, not rushing in to buy and get out,' he said. Mr John Hume, leader of the SDLP, welcomed the announcement as 'a very good day for the people of Northern Ireland, a day which they deserve. Let us now put the past behind us and work together to build a future we can all be proud of.' Mr Jim Wilson, general secretary of the Ulster Unionist party, welcomed the move and said it was clear that the loyalist paramilitaries had been listening to his party leader Mr James Molyneaux when he said that there had been no sell-out to republicans and no shift in the government attitude to the future constitutional position of the province. Mr David Trimble, Ulster Unionist MP, said there would have to be an election before the fringe loyalist political parties and Sinn Fein could be invited to political talks. He said: 'We are dealing here with very small political parties and we are dealing with the question of whether they do in fact have an electoral mandate. In another way Sinn Fein have the same problem.' The Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionist party, welcomed 'the fact that people are not going to continue murdering'. But he totally rejected any suggestion of talks involving former paramilitaries on either side. 'There's nobody can get to the negotiating table because they've used a gun and murdered people,' he said. Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, welcomed the loyalist ceasefire and urged Mr Major to 'stop fumbling with this peace process' and to accelerate the government's response.

0,FT921-6845 ,"FT921-6845 _AN-CBZA5ABYFT 920226   FT  26 FEB 92 / Leading Article: Anglo-Irish shutters   MR ALBERT REYNOLDS, the new Irish prime minister, said in his first international interview that he would like to be remembered as 'the man who opened up the shutters and let in the light'. He has had a tempestuous start. News of the Irish courts' refusal to allow an abortion for a 14-year-old girl who had been raped reached the world faster than that of his own inauguration or the latest atrocities in the north. The case cannot be blamed on the new administration in Dublin. It is a reminder, however, that if Ireland wants to live in the modern world - and, in particular, the European Community - the international spotlight will sometimes burn the skin. In a development little noticed outside the Republic, the Irish government negotiated a protocol to the Maastricht Treaty allowing it to maintain its own anti-abortion laws, without being over-ruled by the European Court. Since, in Ireland, Maastricht has to be ratified by referendum, all sorts of troubles could be in store, including a referendum on Europe that becomes a referendum on abortion. That kind of problem over 'subsidiarity' in EC decision-making is familiar enough to the UK government, to which Mr Reynolds pays his first official visit as prime minister today. Dealing with Europe is not the only problem they have in common; there is also the question of Northern Ireland. Given the imminence of a general election, little new can be expected from the British. Constitutional change Mr Reynolds has already stated his readiness to put articles two and three of the Irish constitution, which claim the right to legislate for the whole island of Ireland, on the negotiating table. That is not a huge advance on previous Irish statements, but he has at least suggested it at the beginning of his period of office and should be encouraged to build on it. In return the British government should repeat that while it is opposed to the unification of Ireland against the wishes of the majority of the people in the north, it is not opposed to unity in principle. Such was the position laid down in the Anglo-Irish Agreement of 1985, which made the frequency and relative amiability of Anglo-Irish meetings possible. The 1985 agreement is a flexible document. It can be amended and adapted as the parties to it wish. Without it, it is doubtful whether relations between two fellow members of the European Community would be as harmonious as they are. But it has not proved so far a basis for solving the Ulster question. Partly that is because some Unionists still challenge it; partly it is because it has not stemmed the violence, recently at its worst for many years. Successive political initiatives, like Mr Peter Brooke's, have been tried and petered out. Favourable straws There are one or two mildly favourable straws in the wind. Part of the Workers' party in the Republic is renouncing revolutionary links. Mr Gerry Adams, the president of Sinn Fein, talked at the weekend of a political rather than a military strategy. In the north there is a new movement, Initiative 92, seeking solutions across the sectarian divide. None of these moves represents a decisive, or even a genuinely new stride forward. But they indicate, yet again, that determination in London and Dublin will not necessarily go unrewarded. On the eve of a close-run election campaign, the most helpful development in London would be for the main political parties to state that they will not buy votes from Ulster MPs in the event of a hung parliament. A fully bipartisan approach from Labour and the Conservatives remains, sadly, a distant prospect, but they could at least protect Ulster from the potential horrors of Westminster power brokering by the unionists. It is also time for British politicians to acknowledge that Northern Ireland is too important to be hived off to a secretary of state. At a time of acute pressure for constitutional change in Scotland, the debate about modes of devolution is under way in earnest. Ulster has been allowed to get away too long with claiming that its problems are uniquely intractable.  The Financial Times   London Page 16  "

Mr Martin McGuinness, Sinn Fein chief of staff, said last night: 'Patrick Mayhew read a text which he claims to be a communication sent by me to the British government in late February. I totally refute his claim. The text he read is a counterfeit. No such communication was ever sent. 'It is a lie, yet another lie which has emanated from Patrick Mayhew and John Major in recent times.' His comparison of the version of a March 19 document indicated 'they are now counterfeiting their own documents to meet their current needs'. He said the version of a communication sent by Sinn Fein to Sir Patrick on May 10, and the circumstances surrounding it, were 'equally at variance with the truth and will be proved to be so'. He added: 'His claim that a communication of November 2 to the British Government was from Sinn Fein is equally bogus.' Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, accused the British government of being behind the leaking by unionist politicians of details of secret talks between intermediaries and Sinn Fein. He said that the aim was to divert 'public attention from IRA conditions for peace and to sow confusion and division among republicans.' Four hours before Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, spoke to the Commons, Mr Adams held a press conference in Belfast to release three documents - two from UK government representatives and one from Sinn Fein. He said they made clear that 'the British were quite blatantly abusing the lines of communication for their own narrow short-term interests'. But he produced no documents to support his central allegation that an IRA offer in March of a two-week ceasefire in return for talks had been rejected by the UK government for 'internal political reasons', missing an opportunity for peace days before the IRA's Bishopsgate bomb attack. Neither the press conference nor the documents drew attention to the fact that the IRA had continued its bombing campaign in the province and on the mainland. The press conference was preceded by an IRA attack on a police barracks in Belfast. The attack was small and caused no injuries, consistent with the IRA's apparent decision not to mount a spectacular attack prior to the Dublin summit. But it was a reminder of its capacity to act in the absence of a political breakthrough.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P8651 Political Organizations.

0,FT924-9347 ,"FT924-9347 _AN-CKFB8AHBFT 921106   FT  06 NOV 92 / Survey of Ireland (8): A state of chassis - Angela Long seeks a road out of the dark ages      By ANGELA LONG   A BOREEN, in Irish, is a little back road, likely to feature overgrown hedgerows and an assortment of potholes. Charming as they are, they are not exactly suitable for large transport vehicles. Ireland is full of boreens. One of the attractions of endorsing the Maastricht treaty in last June's referendum, according to the government headed by Mr Albert Reynolds, was the IPounds 6bn in EC funds which would build bigger, better roads and other infrastructural necessities. A standard map of Europe map shows the difference between road networks on mainland Europe and those in Ireland. While German, Dutch and French motorways appear as black spiders' webs on the page, Ireland boasts a few lines: the N1 down the east coast, the N6 across from Dublin to the west and the N7 down to Limerick and Cork. Irish people in their early thirties can remember national rejoicing when the double carriageway on the Naas road was opened. These few miles of modern road linking the capital with a town to its south-west represented a symbolic breakthrough to the world of the autobahn, which Ireland must join  -or be forever peripheral in every sense. As recently as two years ago Mr Oliver Haslette, the then president of the Construction Industry Federation, was complaining that Ireland was 'in the Dark Ages' as far as transport went, with 'the most diabolical roads you could imagine.' - But more than 40 important road projects presently eat up about IPounds 600m of government funds - plus the essential EC funds - across Ireland. The National Roads Authority (set up in 1988) and local authorities are charged with carrying out the planning. The National Development Plan adopted by the government in 1989 gives priority to improving Ireland's supply infrastructure, emphasising the vital sea routes and small but growing air freight; sea, road and rail account for nearly 99 per cent of freight carried to and from Ireland. The Industrial Development Authority likes to mention the telecommunications network, recipient of big investment in the 1980s, as another important component of Ireland's infrastructure. But roads - to carry goods and agricultural produce to the ferry ports of the east coast - are the first plank in the policy. Of these, the Dublin Port Access road project is the biggest in cash terms; its budget is IPounds 96m. Athlone, smack in the middle of Ireland, is a town which benefited typically from a new road which was Ireland's largest single civil engineering venture. Before the 1990s, Athlone's had main street was choked with trans-national traffic heading for Galway and points west. The Athlone bypass has changed that. Other towns, such as Arklow in County Wexford, are scheduled to get the same relief. Improving local quality of life is one thing; improving the livelihoods of the local people is another - a prospect arising from the hoped-for increase in export/import trade after the Channel tunnel speeds journey times to continental Europe. 30 per cent of Irish exports go to Britain, but there is a big balance for the continent and beyond. More than half of the inward-bound bulk shipments on ferries (oil and coal, for example) come from countries outside the EC. The Republic has four main ports, Dublin, Cork, Waterford and Rosslare. Roll-on/roll-off (ro-ro) services go only to the UK and France, but the lift on/lift off services (lo/lo) also go to the Netherlands (Rotterdam), Belgium (Antwerp) and Germany (Hamburg). Much of the present sense of crisis is because of the imminent opening of the Channel Tunnel. The thought of being the only country in the EC without direct road/rail access in the market of 350m consumers is a psychological handicap for Irish exporters. Commentators point out that a joint, concerted, Northern Ireland/Republic of Ireland transport strategy is the best solution for both. Dr Con Power, chairman of the interim National Roads Authority is among those who have taken to task both Dublin and Westminster for the lack of any integrated transport policy. It would apply not only to roads: the rail link between the two capitals also needs to be upgraded and provided with fresh rolling stock. The Chartered Institute of Transport recently declared that Ireland would have to spend IPounds 2bn on urgent infrastructure projects if her competitiveness were not to be seriously affected. Apart from the familiar arguments about roads and upgrading ports, the CIT estimates that 60 new rail locomotives are needed, and 14 new ships should ply the sea routes to Britain and mainland Europe (a point emphasised by the tragic deaths of two teenagers last August, when an old ventilation system on board a ferry malfunctioned, producing toxic gas. While the rest of Ireland grumbles that it misses out on Dublin's advantages of being close to the ports, and campaigns for new roads, Dublin labours under the burden of its traffic problem. The port is right on top of the city centre; heavy transport vehicles clog famous thoroughfares. The government has commissioned a report, combining civil servants, consultants and interest group submissions, on ways to handle Dublin's existing traffic and divert vehicles which have to use the central routes because there are no obvious alternatives. It is having a long and quarrelsome gestation.  The Financial Times   London Page 35  "

0,FT943-12276 ,"FT943-12276 _AN-EGZEHADXFT 940726   FT  26 JUL 94 / Leading Article: Next steps in Ulster   The news from Sinn Fein is, as ever, dire. The political wing of the Irish Republican Army announced, after lengthy deliberations on Sunday, that sections of the joint Irish-British peace declaration of December 1993 were 'negative and contradictory'. It could not, it said, accept what it called the 'Unionist veto' on a united Ireland. It declined to promise that IRA terrorism would cease, so that points of difference could be debated at the conference table. Clearly the IRA/Sinn Fein is fixated on the idea that, since it cannot persuade a majority of the people of Ulster to accept the governance of the Republic of Ireland, it must persist in its attempts to bomb them into submission. This strategy of the 'armed struggle' has failed for 25 years. It will fail even if it continues for another quarter of a century. There will not be peace until the IRA understands this. Sinn Fein leaders are adept propagandists. They talk misleadingly of a 'new phase in the peace process' while they simultaneously decline to call an end to violence. They are not, however, shrewd judges of the British character. The public is horrified at the long run of atrocities perpetrated by the IRA and, in recent years, the 'loyalist' paramilitaries. This does not mean that a policy of cut and run would be tolerated. The contrary is true. Any British government, of whatever colour, that left the people of Ulster in a state of chaos and civil war would be held in deep contempt. Its survival in office would be in doubt. Democratic basis The search for a political solution must therefore continue. The joint declaration provides a democratic basis for such a solution. Its cardinal principle is self-determination. Any party that wants a united Ireland must persuade a majority of the people of Ulster, as of the republic, to accept it. It is this principle that sticks in Sinn Fein's throat. So be it. The British and Irish governments should move quickly towards a new constitutional settlement. The other participants in this process are Northern Ireland parties that have renounced violence and are willing to attend talks. In essence this excludes the Unionist party led by the Reverend Ian Paisley as well as Sinn Fein. Progress towards a 'framework agreement' has been delayed for too long while waiting for the IRA to renounce violence and the Paisleyites to join the negotiations. Mr John Major could make this clear to Mr Paisley today. What is required now is a willingness on the part of all those who are in the talks to take risks. Each party to the process knows the leap of faith that is required; none has yet demonstrated a willingness to make the jump. The Ulster Unionists led by Mr James Molyneaux would assist if they entertained proposals for cross-border co-operation. Mr John Hume's mainly Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party should abandon the illusion that it can influence Sinn Fein. The details of Mr Hume's agreement with Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, should be published. It might expose the emptiness of the latter's protestations. Clear statement The British government could assist by presenting a draft amendment of the Government of Ireland Act. That would have to include a clear statement of intent to transfer sovereignty over Ulster should its people wish it. Such a statement would constitute a guarantee that Britain means what it says about self-determination. In return, the Irish government would be asked to bring forward counterpart amendments to articles 2 and 3 of the republic's constitution, so that the aspiration for a united Ireland contained in them would be tempered by phraseology to the effect that Ulster is recognised to be part of the United Kingdom unless its people decide otherwise. This last leap forward may be the most difficult for any of the parties concerned. All Irish political parties save Sinn Fein accept the Irish-British joint declaration. So does an overwhelming majority of the Irish people. Singling out the proposition that Ulster can decide on its own is, however, risky. Putting it to a referendum might backfire. People in the republic are uneasy when accused of leaving their northern cousins in the lurch. Yet if the peace process is to be accelerated, someone has to make the first move.

Speaking on the eve of the first visit to parliament for more than a decade by Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, the prime minister said the government would begin talks next month with both the IRA's political wing and loyalist representatives - 'so long as the ceasefire is maintained'. It is understood that the talks with Sinn Fein will probably begin first. The prime minister assured MPs that Northern Ireland remained at the top of the government's priorities, but said there was still 'a long way to go' before peace in the province was secure. He said good progress had been made in discussions with the Irish government on the joint framework document that will form the basis of talks involving Ulster's main political parties. The document would contain proposals for a locally elected Ulster assembly and suggest a framework for cross-border structures to handle north-south relations. But he emphasised that the framework document would not be 'a straitjacket'. It was not a 'London-Dublin deal' that was set to be imposed, he said. Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader, expressed 'cautious optimism' on the province's future and promised that Labour would continue to support the peace process. Mr Major's remarks came as leading unionists made clear they would not be sorry to see the departure of Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, if he fails to hold on to his premiership. Mr David Trimble, the Ulster Unionist party's legal spokesman, said: 'In a sense almost anyone would be better than Albert Reynolds.' Mr Trimble added: 'As we see it Mr Reynolds . . . has been trying to get quick results. He has been trying to force the pace of peace negotiations and creating an air of crisis.' He rejected the idea that Fine Gael, the main opposition party in Dublin, is more pro-unionist than Mr Reynolds' Fianna Fail. Mr Ian Paisley Jnr, of the hardline Democratic Unionist party, said the peace process would continue whatever government was in power in Dublin. Mr David Ervine of the Progressive Unionist party, which speaks for some loyalist paramilitaries, said a change of government in the republic would not damage the peace process. He added: 'This is a bigger issue than any individual or any group of individuals.'   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.     IEZ  Ireland, EC.   Industries:-  P9199 General Government, NEC.

These include renewed emphasis on promoting indigenous Irish industry, on targeting small businesses with venture capital funding, on legislating for new investment products which will encourage equity investment by fund managers in Irish industry, 'and massive investment in improving the skills base of the workforce,' he said. Until January Mr Quinn was the Irish Labour Party's spokesman on economic affairs. Labour's breakthrough at last November's election gave it leverage to negotiate for powerful positions in the coalition government. One of those was Mr Quinn's, which merged the ministerial post of labour with those of industry and commerce. 'We have merged the two departments because we want to do away with the old adversarial approach in the process of wealth creation and replace it with a social partnership approach. We want agreement between industry, the unions and government on a long-term strategy - so that any foreign investor can come here to Ireland and knock on the door of any of the three and know that we are all talking the same langauage,' he said. Ireland's past three finance ministers, starting with Mr Ray MacSharry in 1987, all adopted this approach, firstly through the Programme for National Recovery, and later through the Programme for Social and Economic Progress. The public sector pay elements of this agreement will expire at the end of this year. Both programmes have sought to lay down macro-economic parameters to attain price stability, reduce government debt and to improve incomes through economic growth and gradual tax reductions. They have been largely successful. Ireland's economy has outperformed most EC partners over the past five years in GDP growth. The cost, however, has been heavy in unemployment. Labour's success at the polls last year was largely on the back of the lengthening dole queues and the expectation that Labour would do something to reverse the trend. 'Our strategy is to build on a skill-based workforce. We are no longer a country of low-cost labour, and we don't aspire to return to that. Low-cost manufacturing jobs are drifting out of Europe anyway. We want intellectual skills-based industry here, such as electronics, pharmaceuticals, telemarketing and software. We shall continue to promote foreign investment, but our central focus will be on building and strengthening indigenous companies,' he said. Where will the funding come from to finance these plans? Mr Quinn says that the IPounds 8bn (Pounds 8bn) in EC structural and cohesion funds due to be paid to Ireland over the next seven years will go a long way to help finance improvements. But he hopes the bulk will come from new equity investment.   Countries:-  IEZ  Ireland, EC.   Industries:-  P9611 Administration of General Economic Programs.

Sir Patrick's note of caution came as Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, attacked London for 'consistently trying to reduce the momentum of the peace process'. Meanwhile, Mr Mitchel McLoughlin, another senior Sinn Fein figure, warned that the process could break down if London insisted on paramilitary groups surrendering their weapons before agreement on political structures was in sight. These latest indications of the difficulty of the path ahead came on the eve of Sinn Fein's first meeting with the Republic's main political parties in the Dublin-based Forum for Peace and Reconciliation. Speaking in Dublin, Mr Adams dismissed the government's Irish policy as 'crisis management' and accused it of trying to avoid the political and constitutional change that was 'fundamental to a lasting peace settlement'. Sir Patrick told the first House of Commons debate on the province since the IRA and loyalist ceasefires that he greatly hoped London and Dublin would reach agreement but 'it is not certain'. His tone was less upbeat than that of Mr John Major, the prime minister, who met Mr Albert Reynolds, his Irish counterpart, at Chequers on Monday. Mr Major said after the talks that both were 'confident of being able to reach agreement'. Sir Patrick reaffirmed the government's readiness to hold preliminary talks with republican leaders by the end of the year if London could continue 'reasonably' to assume Sinn Fein was 'establishing a commitment to exclusively peaceful methods'. They would 'embrace the Republicans' proposals for depositing and de-commissioning their armaments', he said. Sir Patrick sought to reassure Unionists by saying there were no circumstances in which security would be reduced to a level below that needed to counter the threat of 'terrorist crime'. He hinted that the army would not pull out of the province entirely. Meanwhile, Dublin yesterday sought to play down the significance of a disclosure in yesterday's Financial Times that it had suggested draft amendments to article 2 of its constitution, defining Ulster as part of the republic's 'national territory'. Dublin said the reports were 'two or three months out of date'. The issue of article 2 was not raised at Chequers, an Irish spokesman said. 'At no stage has the British government asked the Irish government to define the nation in any way that would have left the Unionists out of the Irish nation.'

0,FT932-1680 ,"FT932-1680 _AN-DFWCJAADFT 930623   FT  23 JUN 93 / Mates refuses to resign over links with Nadir: Major infuriated by claims about funding of Tory party      By RALPH ATKINS and PHILIP STEPHENS      LONDON, COPENHAGEN   MR JOHN MAJOR last night faced a fresh test of his authority when the minister at the centre of the row over Tory links with fugitive businessman Mr Asil Nadir made clear he would not resign. As the prime minister and Sir Norman Fowler, Tory party chairman, reacted angrily to the latest allegations over undisclosed donations to the Tory party, Mr Michael Mates, Northern Ireland minister, said: 'I have done nothing wrong.' Signalling that he hoped to brazen out calls to resign, Mr Mates said the prime minister had expressed 'full confidence' in him - though Mr Major's support has been less than wholehearted. At the European Community summit in Copenhagen, Mr Major gave the impression he would be ready to accept Mr Mates' resignation but was reluctant to sack him. The prime minister stuck to the line that Mr Mates had been guilty of misjudgment but not 'a hanging offence'. The reaction of senior Tory MPs today and tomorrow is likely to determine Mr Mates' fate. Many had been urging him to resign after revelations about a watch he gave to Mr Nadir and the loan of a car by a public relations adviser working for the head of the collapsed Polly Peck business empire. However the 1922 committee executive of backbench Tories could decide to rally behind Mr Mates in an attempt to avoid undermining Mr Major's leadership or leaving him vulnerable to charges of indecision. In Copenhagen, Mr Major denounced as 'fantasy' reports that the Conservatives had accepted contributions from the Saudi royal family and rejected calls from opposition MPs that the party reveal the names of donors. Last night, a Labour MP used parliamentary privilege to quote from a letter naming Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, as having met a Saudi prince before the last election to discuss aid to the Tories. But earlier Mr Major did little to disguise his anger at allegations about contributors to Tory funds. Newspapers should provide evidence for the charges or 'stop printing them', he said. Referring to a Guardian report that a Saudi royal family member had contributed several million pounds to the Tories just before the last election, he insisted: 'The Conservative party does not accept money from foreign governments or from royal families and has not done so.' Clearly enraged about the continuing suggestions that the party was funded through much of the 1980s from questionable sources, Mr Major offered another hint that it was preparing to pay back money given to the Tories by Mr Nadir. Mr Major rejected the principle of state funding of political parties, as urged by the Labour party. But he insisted: 'In the event that any money handed to us is found to be tainted we will return that money.' Separately, Sir Norman used a Commons debate on financing of political parties to attack Touche Ross, liquidators to Polly Peck, for taking two years to reply to a letter from Conservative Central Office on Mr Nadir's Pounds 440,000 of donations and for leaking information to Sunday newspapers. Prince Bandar bin Sultan, Saudi ambassador to the US, said he was considering legal action against The Guardian for a report yesterday that he authorised a Pounds 7m donation to Tory funds.

0,FT944-16262 ,"FT944-16262 _AN-EJND7ACAFT 941014   FT  14 OCT 94 / The Loyalist Ceasefire: Now to choose representatives for the negotiating table - Prospects for the paramilitaries      By JOHN MURRAY BROWN and Our Belfast Correspondent   In announcing yesterday a cessation of hostilities from midnight Ulster's loyalist hardliners were not merely responding to the challenge thrown down by the IRA's six-week-old ceasefire. By drawing a line under the era of violence loyalists - like the IRA in neighbouring West Belfast - were demanding a place at the negotiating table in any discussions on the future of the province, ahead of the expected agreement between London and Dublin on the long-awaited framework document. The main question remains if the loyalists are now to enter the democratic fray, who exactly will represent them? Mr David Irvine of the fringe Progressive Unionists (PUP) said: 'No section of our community should be left out of the discussions for our future.' He is said to have close links with the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF), the younger of the two paramilitary organisations represented at yesterday's press conference. The loyalist paramilitaries have no formal electoral backing - unlike the IRA which through Sinn Fein, its political wing, can claim a mandate - albeit a small one, with less than 10 per cent of votes in the province at the last election. Mr Irvine and the Ulster Democratic party's Mr Gary McMichael - as a Lisburn councillor the only person on the platform to hold elective office - projected themselves as sophisticated and well-suited politicians. Some believe that Mr Hugh Smyth of the PUP, the mayor of Belfast - said to be close to loyalist opinion - is keen to take a leading role. But one mainstream unionist politician said there would have to be elections before loyalist leaders could claim political legitimacy in the community. The prospect is that the emergence of this new radical force will cause further fragmentation in unionist ranks. Behind the loyalists' decision to seek a place in the negotiations is the sense of dissatisfaction in poorer protestant areas with the mainstream unionist parties - Mr James Molyneaux's Ulster Unionist party and the hardline Democratic Unionist party led by the Rev Ian Paisley. As one community leader put it: 'Gerry Adams is getting out and talking to people. When was the last time Jim Molyneaux came down this street?' Mr Irvine said yesterday: 'Both parties sitting at this table have proven that they are prepared to enter the future with less baggage than the other unionist parties.' By Northern Ireland hardliner standards yesterday's loyalist statement was almost a model of moderation and flexibility. In particular, it was at pains to make clear they would have nothing against talking with Sinn Fein, something Mr Paisley has said he will never countenance. Mr 'Gusty' Spence, one of the founders of the UVF, said: 'Of course the day will come when we will sit down with Sinn Fein. Everything will have to be in place. It will have to be right for them, for us, for everyone. And yes I think we'll do good business together.' Many of those representing the loyalist paramilitaries on yesterday's platform had done time in prison on terrorist-related offences, and it is easy to imagine the experience has been both chastening and educational. Younger men, who have taken command of the organisations in recent years, are understood to have driven a very hard bargain before agreeing to end the violence. But the fringe political parties which have persuaded them to enter the democratic process are convinced the ceasefire will hold. The murder campaigns of the two main loyalist terrorist organisations in Northern Ireland have surpassed the IRA in recent years. For that reason the Ulster Defence Association (UDA) and UVF regard their ceasefire decision as having been taken from a position of strength. The decision also points to a long-term strategy to don the clothes of democratic politics and shelve the Armalite. Much has been made of the role of the loyalist leadership's consultations on Monday with loyalist prisoners in the Maze prison on the decision to call a halt to violence. The government's announcement, restated this week by Mr John Major, the prime minister, that any new arrangement for the province would have to be put to referendum, has also done much to calm fears of a sell-out of unionist interests. In spite of demands by the Combined Loyalist Military Command, most observers believe the delay in responding to the IRA move had as much to do with public relations as substantive issues.

The unprecedented move was announced yesterday by Scotland Yard with minimum details so as to protect the main sponsors from further terrorist attacks. In a rare example of an institution prepared to comment, the National Westminster Bank, whose City of London tower office was badly damaged in the last attack by the IRA on the City in April, said it strongly backed the initiative. The bank said: 'This is an important additional mechanism that will help pursue those responsible for terrorist attacks.' According to Scotland Yard, the initiative had been jointly developed over the past year by senior officers of its anti-terrorist branch S013 and top managers of UK-based companies. S013 has national UK mainland responsibility for conducting anti-terrorist operations together with MI5, the security service. Money already committed comes from dozens of unnamed companies throughout the country and will be administered by joint agreement between the police and the main sponsors. It is not clear yet if the full sum will be held in an escrow account or remain the responsibility of the companies until needed. The amount to be paid out at any one time will depend on the quality of the information. A spokesman for Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist branch said last night: 'Our experience is that we do not have to provide financial inducement to get useful information on terrorist activities. But if there is the slightest chance that an individual might be tipped over by a reward, then we should take it.' The initiative was prompted by business concern at the commercial costs of IRA attacks over the past two years in the City and elsewhere. Neither the Corporation of London nor the headquarters of the Confederation of British Industry in London would comment on the initiative. In Northern Ireland, the local business community will today back a trade union initiated 'community day of action' in support of peace. Mr Nigel Smyth, the CBI's Northern Ireland director, said there was a widespread feeling now that every effort should be made to bring violence to an end. 'People have to accept that we have to look to the future and we need compromise and understanding,' he said. Business leaders in the province are holding back from detailed political pronouncements for fear they might be targeted by terrorists. But significantly the CBI has not rejected any option for getting peace talks under way. Mates denies he talked to Sinn Fein, Page 8   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

The President did so despite his Administration's failure to  elicit from Mr Adams the unequivocal renunciation of violence  and declaration of support for the Anglo-lrish peace effort that  it had agreed with Britain should be the minimum conditions for  letting him in.    The decision comes on the eve of the visit to Washington by  Douglas Hurd, Foreign Secretary, and seems certain to raise new  questions about the so-called ""special relationship"" since Mr  Clinton took power. It is almost inconceivable that the Bush or  Reagan Administrations would have delivered such a public slap  in the face to America's closest ally.    Though the move caught Downing Street officials by surprise,  they said the decision to provide a visa was ""a matter for the  U.S."" British officials in Washington were making  representations to the White House at the weekend. Putting a  brave face on events, Downing Street said it hoped the New York  conference would impress on Mr Adams the need to end violence  permanently. There was no indication that John Major considered  Mr Adams's words as amounting to an acceptance of U.S.  conditions.    Mr Adams said last night that he had received no official  notification of the American decision but had had ""a very  interesting exchange of views"" with American consular officials.  He said he had not been asked to renounce violence.    John D. Taylor, Ulster Unionist MP for Strangford, said the  decision was despicable and that the Clinton Administration had  ""given in"" to pressure from the Irish lobby in Washington.    Mr Clinton has been under pressure to let in Mr Adams from  Senators Edward Kennedy and Daniel Patrick Moynihan, whose  support he needs for his health care reforms, and from 38  congressmen who argue that the U.S. should foster ""constructive  dialogue"" instead of violence.    The State and Justice Departments and the FBI had agreed  with  Britain that Mr Adams's application should be rejected because  of his terrorist links, as eight before it had been. Their views  were apparently overruled by the National Security Council and  by Nancy Soderberg, NSC third-in-command and a former aide to  Senator Kennedy. The White House said Mr Clinton supported the  decision which he believed would ""help advance the cause of  peace in Northern Ireland.""     "

After a day of non-stop telephone diplomacy between the Mr John Major and Mr Albert Reynolds, Whitehall officials said the statement would be released after a meeting of the two prime ministers later today. Mr Major expects to spell out the accord to MPs before parliament breaks for Christmas recess on Friday. Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, said last night Dublin and London were now 'very close to agreement'. But even as the British and Irish prime ministers were clearing the remaining obstacles, some politicians in the province were questioning if it would bring lasting peace. The declaration, designed to reconcile the competing interests of the province's unionist majority with the Irish nationalist aspirations will be hailed by both leaders as the best chance since 1968 for an end to terrorism. Its release will follow weeks of intense and often acrimonious negotiations between Mr Major and Mr Reynolds, culminating yesterday in a frantic series of telephone conversations between the two men and their officials. Downing Street officials said the two prime ministers had resolved the main differences over the declaration, but further negotiations would be needed during their meeting to clear up some less important issues. The statement will include a firm guarantee to the protestant majority in the province its status as part of the UK could only be changed with their consent. It will also signal Mr Reynolds' willingness to drop the Republic's constitutional claim to the North in the event of a permanent political settlement. But in return Mr Major is thought to have agreed to language in the declaration which goes further than hitherto in acknowledging the aspirations of those seeking a united Ireland. Mr Reynolds, who has said he would not accept any declaration which did not offer a reasonable prospect of an end to the IRA campaign, has been pressing the unionist veto to be coupled with a broader commitment to Irish self-determination. He also wants an all-Ireland convention to provide an early opportunity for Sinn Fein to join talks. The precise phrases in that section of the communique - will be critical in determining the impact of the declaration. If they move too far in the direction of Sinn Fein, they will threaten a unionist backlash against Mr Major's government and its fragile majority at Westminster. That in turn could trigger a renewed escalation in the terrorist campaign being waged by protestant paramilitaries. Officials acknowledged last night that the two leaders were uncertain if it would persuade the IRA to abandon its military campaign.

The new handling centre for undeliverable letters will be opened in May at Donegall Quay, part of the Laganside inner-city redevelopment area.

Mr John Major and Mr Albert Reynolds agreed during talks in Brussels to speed up work towards a framework agreement to persuade Ulster's constitutional parties to return to the negotiating table. They rejected as a basis for peace the conclusions of recent talks between Mr John Hume of the SDLP and Mr Gerry Adams of Sinn Fein. There could be 'no question' of the two governments adopting or endorsing Mr Hume's report of the dialogue. That report was passed yesterday for the first time to Mr Major by Mr Reynolds. A joint communique, however, released by the British and Irish prime ministers after their meeting, left open the possibility of Sinn Fein being brought into the peace process if and when 'a renunciation of violence had been made and sufficiently demonstrated'. In those circumstances 'new doors could open'. At the end of a week of the worst sectarian violence for two decades, the two leaders condemned the tit-for-tat killings by terrorists from the Catholic and Protestant communities. Their communique attacked the 'murderous and premeditated acts which could serve no end other than to deepen the bloodshed in Northern Ireland'. Mr Major and Mr Reynolds reaffirmed their determination to restart the stalled negotiating process designed to bring a permanent political settlement to the province. Their cautiously upbeat tone followed the Dublin government's acknowledgement earlier this week of the right of the Unionist community to exercise a permanent veto on changes in Ulster's constitutional status. Both sides confirmed that the essence of any agreement would be a move by the Republic to replace its constitutional claim to the province with the aspiration of a united Ireland. Britain in return would offer a significant extension of cross-border administration. But the communique glossed over significant differences on the extent to which elements of the Hume-Adams peace initiative could be incorporated into their own negotiations. Mr Reynolds told Mr Major that the two sides could not ignore the potential for a cessation of violence by the IRA in return for a place at the negotiating table for Sinn Fein. But, speaking after their talks, Mr Major told journalists that there could be 'no talks or negotiations between democratic governments and those who use, threaten or support violence'. Nor could there be any secret agreements or understandings with Sinn Fein or the IRA. Despite their new determination to fill the political vacuum in which the terrorists have flourished, the two leaders also acknowledged that an intergovernmental agreement would not be enough in itself to bring peace.

All the British government had to do, according to Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, was to talk to republicans for one hour and the door to peace in Northern Ireland could open. This morning, with the IRA's three-day ceasefire over, the door remains stubbornly shut. The IRA's decision to call a post-Easter suspension of violence may have been unconditional and unprecedented - almost certainly arising more from pressure upon it to stop the killing than on any fundamental change of heart  -but it never looked good enough. Given some expectations, especially in Dublin, that the provisionals had planned a more dramatic, open-ended gesture aimed at ending the political stalemate, the 72-hour standstill impressed few people outside the republican movement. Why should anyone be grateful for what amounted to 'a suspended sentence of death', Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, asked yesterday. If the IRA and Sinn Fein were trying to drive a wedge between London and Dublin they will have been deeply disappointed by the two governments' show of unity. If they ever calculated that Mr John Major's own parlous position might force him into taking risks to win a triumphant peace they were wrong again. The Irish government called the respite from murder and intimidation 'pathetically brief' and its senior officials admit privately they expected something longer. The strength of reaction in Dublin is thought to have come as a surprise to republicans, who expected a more positive response after comments from Mr Dick Spring, Irish foreign minister, that he would seek to 'build upon' a temporary ceasefire. Having moved to accommodate Sinn Fein by dropping the broadcasting ban on the party and by providing, unlike London, extensive 'clarification' of the Downing Street declaration, Dublin feels let down. Throughout the ceasefire London continued to play a straight bat, repeatedly dismissing it as a 'cynical ploy' to extract concessions under threat of renewed violence. While the government chanted its peace mantra - 'no talks without a permanent end to violence' - unionists talked of IRA volunteers heading for the seaside to plan their next atrocities. Sinn Fein, still battling to extract clarification from London on the joint declaration but refusing to say what Britain could clarify that had not already been made clear by Dublin, hailed the IRA action as evidence of a flexible and open-minded republican movement anxious for peace. Republicans having taken the initiative, Mr Adams said, it was a case of 'over to you, Mr Major'. This week, however, the depth of Sinn Fein's anger at being marginalised in the political process - the price it is made to pay for its militaristic connections - became clear. Britain, insisted Mr Martin McGuinness, a leading Sinn Fein official, must stop treating it as a second-class political party instead of one speaking for those who were 'no longer prepared to be oppressed, humiliated, degraded and discriminated against'. To republicans, their war is an issue of pride and dignity as well as a matter of national boundaries. Sinn Fein has arguably been on firmer ground in citing the British government's previous, lengthy dialogue with republicans. Why, given the chance of a real breakthrough, is the government refusing to talk now, they inquire? Last year Sir Patrick won warm support from MPs for justifying contacts with republicans as an attempt to save lives. But in the wake of a joint declaration which enshrines the principles of majority consent, he now says there can be no truck with active terrorists. Efforts to bridge the gap between the two sides included unsuccessful calls for a go-between to relay Sinn Fein's specific concerns to the government. Hopes that the public rhetoric was concealing secret contacts seem, so far, unfounded, though suspicions linger that they will eventually be resumed. The failure to make any headway this week means further ceasefires will be tough to achieve. The position of those within Sinn Fein, such as Mr Adams, who helped bring it about could be weakened. The IRA knows that if it splits, it dies; it does not intend to split. As the province prepared itself uneasily for evidence that the ceasefire was over, Mr John Hume, leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party, called on the IRA to halt its armed struggle and help break down the barriers in the hearts and minds of the Irish people. The last 72 hours notwithstanding, it does not yet appear ready to heed the call.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.     IEZ  Ireland, EC.   Industries:-  P9721 International Affairs.

The best chance for a lasting peace in Northern Ireland lies in talks between war-weary combatants in a never-ending conflict. But there ends the meeting of minds. The IRA and Sinn Fein know full well that there is mounting popular pressure for peace and want to be seen wanting to talk. The British and Irish governments, in spite of the almost daily mantra declaring the peace process waits for no one, would also prefer to talk. The two sides, to the embarrassment of the British government, have already done so. But how to get there again without one or the other losing face is the dilemma now confronting both. Unless there is a way through, the conflict could be set for another long, bloody phase. London and Dublin stand apparently indivisible in their determination not to talk to terrorists until the violence ends. Dublin, always more ready than London to offer explanation of the joint Downing Street declaration, believes there is no more room for further clarification and is increasingly contemptuous of the republican position. Sunday's equivocal, late-night statement from the IRA - issued from Dublin and signed by the apparently flexible if fictitious 'P. O'Neill' of the Irish Republican Publicity Bureau - avoids an explicit rejection of December's Downing Street declaration. But it leaves the chances of lasting peace as elusive as ever. The triple onslaught at Heathrow airport - arguably attracting more column inches and political outrage at Westminster than would a dozen murders in Ulster - taken together with the IRA's first formal response to the declaration, seem to provide a clearer picture of the next, presumably agreed, phase in republican strategy. The mortars at Heathrow - irrespective of whether they were doctored to minimise injuries - were not to be a final flexing of military muscle before a ceasefire. The attacks can be seen as part of the pattern of 'spectaculars' predicted by Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president. They are likely to continue. The IRA and Sinn Fein clearly believe the British government can eventually be made to give further ground. The prime objective of republicans now is to return to the position nearly a year ago when, after lengthy, secret contacts between the two sides, they believed the British government was preparing for detailed peace talks. But if peace is on its mind, the republican movement appears convinced that  -having made considerable progress while violence continues - it can expect the two governments to give further ground under duress. The IRA's Dublin statement, greeted variously as a sign of hope or of contemptible cynicism, blames the 'negative attitude' of the British government for lack of progress. The mortars have triggered renewed calls for the government to do something to re-energise the London-Dublin initiative, while underlining how limited are ministers' options for mounting an instant military or political response. London's desire for rapid progress on political talks has been stymied both by the tendency of the constitutional parties to retreat to entrenched positions in readiness for June's European elections and by Dublin's reluctance to show its hand over relations between north and south. On security, any dramatic response by London - such as internment - is ruled out. Besides handing the IRA a propaganda victory, it would give the lie to past assertions that co-operation between London and Dublin on such matters is already extremely good. Downing Street yesterday signalled some fresh efforts in this area by revealing that new discussions with Dublin aimed at making co-operation 'even more effective' would urgently take place at official level. The government yesterday restated its position that there would be no negotiations before the IRA ended its armed campaign. But whatever it says in public, further secret contacts with republican leaders can never be ruled out. When last year's sequence of secret messages between London and the republican movement was exposed in November, Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, insisted that these had not amounted to negotiation, a formula which could be repeated. But whatever the next step, it can now be seen that the Downing Street declaration - irrespective of its longer-term value - has failed to make an early breakthrough in the search for peace. The prize remains great but the fight seems nowhere near over.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P9721 International Affairs.   Types:-  NEWS  General News.

0,FT942-6831 ,"FT942-6831 _AN-EE0DLAH3FT 940527   FT  27 MAY 94 / Survey of Relocation in the UK (20): The ugly bride with the big dowry - Investing in Ireland      By MICHAEL CASSELL   There is no escaping it. Whatever the commercial and strategic attractions of setting up shop in Northern Ireland, the many positive aspects to life in the province remain overshadowed by deeply-ingrained images of a hopelessly divided, dangerous society. Sir Patrick Mayhew, in a recent speech to businessmen, did his best to place Ulster's troubles in their correct perspective, stressing that the province was 'not running a Clint Eastwood scenario 24 hours a day'. Given recent successes in attracting new corporate investment, the message has not been falling on deaf ears. Northern Ireland inevitably has a hard job in selling itself as a business location to companies looking to move existing operations or to establish new ones; why should anyone opt for west Belfast, with its random, sectarian murders and brick and iron barriers intended to separate alien communities? Surely, life in Telford would be much easier? The media agenda dictates that Ulster usually means bad news, with the result that its problems can be distorted and exaggerated. But problems there are and they cannot, sensibly, be minimised by those seeking to attract new investment from within the UK or beyond. Business assets in the province are regularly the victims of paramilitary activity and employees are regularly subjected to intimidation; security costs can be punitive and employers face a daunting catalogue of obligations under a tough set of fair employment laws designed to eradicate discrimination in the workplace. But for most people and most sections of the business community, Ulster's tragedy rarely intrudes directly into their daily lives. The province's economy has, despite the recession, remained relatively buoyant and performed better than in the UK as a whole. Last year, for example, manufacturing output grew by double the UK average. Equally to the point, the province can provide a business base which offers newcomers, by virtue of its extraordinary difficulties, extensive financial incentives to help overcome reservations about moving into what many see as nothing less than a 'war zone'. Ulster, because of its higher-than-average UK unemployment and its 'category one' status within the EU aid hierarchy, can offer cash help that is unrivalled anywhere in Europe. No matter that one development official remarks: 'The bigger the dowry, the uglier the bride'. Cash help may not, alone, be sufficient to give Ulster the edge over alternative locations but in the final analysis, it can tip the balance. Financial aid played a big role, for example, in the recent decision of Transtec, a Birmingham-based specialist engineering group, to set up a Pounds 16m plant in Londonderry to manufacture aluminium castings for the automotive sector. The company will join a growing list of automotive suppliers who have now established operations in the province, including companies from Japan, France, the US and Germany. The new plant will, in the first instance, supply cylinder heads for shipment to Ford of Germany. Transtec already employs more than 2,000 people in 12 wholly-owned subsidiary operations, most of them in the West Midlands. According to Mr Peter Munday, chairman of the company's automotive division, the business had decided on strategic grounds to look beyond its existing casting facility in England for the new plant and had considered a number of European locations before opting for Ulster. The reasons for deciding on Londonderry, already the recipient of a significant inward flow of overseas investment, include good infrastructure, the potential for recruiting quality labour and the all-important assistance of the local industrial development board. Mr Munday added: 'The package of assistance also had to be sufficient to counter offers being made to us by other European locations. Aluminium casting is a very competitive, price-conscious business and we needed to ensure we kept our costs as low as possible. 'We could only do this by examining development areas with the highest incentives for inward investors. Although this was the major priority, it needed also to be coupled with the other plus factors which can be delivered in Northern Ireland, such as good transportation links and a factory which could be built quickly to our specifications.' The Industrial Development Board is not always too keen to discuss the details of financial assistance for specific projects but Mr John McGuckian, its chairman, disclosed that the total government aid package made available to Transtec will be about Pounds 4m. Few locations in Europe will prove as generous in offering cash help accounting for one-quarter of total start-up costs. Operational costs, once established, are also significantly lower than in Britain or in mainland Europe, a point forcefully underlined by Sir Patrick Mayhew in a recent ministerial check-list of Ulster plus-points. He claimed, however, the beneficial picture was 'not the result of sweated labour but in part from a generally lower overall cost of living in Northern Ireland'. For overseas investors, access to the markets of the European Union offers another important bonus and has been the driving factor behind location decisions taken by companies from the US and south-east Asian countries. IDB estimates suggest that around 55,000 people in Ulster are now employed by foreign owners. The total is rising steadily in the wake of a particularly successful period of IDB activity and is shortly expected to be given a huge boost with the decision by Hualon, a Taiwanese textile group, to commence the biggest inward investment project since the ill-fated De Lorean car plant. The European Commission has given clearance to a synthetic fibre project which will bring 2,000 jobs to Glengormley, close to the Belfast. At one stage, the project was thrown into doubt when European textile companies complained that it would create unfair competition, but the overriding need for jobs in the province finally won the day. The new plant is expected to cost nearly Pounds 157m and the UK government, via the IDB, will put around Pounds 60m into the kitty. With financial support on such a scale, fears about the likely impact on business of limited, civil strife quickly recede. The Hualon decision was welcomed by Mr Roy Baillie, vice-chairman of the Confederation of British Industry in Ulster, not just for the badly-needed jobs it would bring but also for the strong signal it would send to other international companies looking for a route into Europe. The hope is that such decisions will not be seen merely as a positive move in the face of Ulster's problems but that, in bringing new prosperity to be shared by all parts of the community, they will help end the province's troubles.

0,FT921-13848 ,"FT921-13848 _AN-CASAAAEDFT 920118   FT  18 JAN 92 / IRA kills seven civilians in Ulster bomb attack      By Our Belfast Correspondent   A MASSIVE IRA bomb killed seven men last night as they returned from work on an Ulster security force base in Co Tyrone. Seven others were hurt, one critically, when the 1,500lb-bomb ripped apart their transit van on the main Omagh to Cookstown road. They were at a place known locally as Teebane crossroads, a few miles from the Republican village of Carrickmore. It was the highest civilian death toll in the province since the IRA Poppy Day massacre at Enniskillen in 1987. The bombing followed warnings by the IRA that terrorist activity is set to increase, both in Ulster and on the UK mainland. In particular, the IRA said two weeks ago that it intended to step up its military activities in Ulster in 1992. It hopes to prevent effective political talks on the future of the province between the UK and Irish governments and between political parties in Northern Ireland. The failure so far by Mr Peter Brooke, Northern Ireland Secretary, to stimulate cross-party dialogue ahead of the UK general election has enabled the terrorists to thrive in a political vacuum. Unionist politicians, outraged by the atrocity, called for an all-out military offensive against the terrorists. As tension rose in the province last night, there were fears that Loyalist paramilitary organisations would mount retaliatory attacks on Republicans. The Rev William McCrea, Democratic Unionist MP for mid-Ulster, said he had no doubt that the bombing was a carefully planned IRA operation. He said that the security forces should be given the scope to combat the IRA free from political interference. It emerged last night that the dead men had been carrying out work at the Lisanelly army base in Omagh. The IRA has carried out attacks on workers supplying or working with the security forces since 1985. Executives have been murdered, several firms have been forced out of business, while others have publicly withdrawn from security force contracts. The bombing will have far-reaching political implications. It is certain to re-open the debate about reintroducing internment, or detention without trial, of terrorist suspects. Mr Ken Maginnis, Ulster Unionist security spokesman and a former major in the Ulster Defence Regiment, said internment should be brought back immediately. Senior army commanders are understood to favour the move as one of the most effective methods of disrupting the IRA's command structure. Ulster talks, Page 4  The Financial Times   London Page 1  "

The IRA had been told that if it ended terrorism, the  British  and Irish governments would be ""generous in their response,"" he  added.    But he said there had to be ""an absolute renunciation of the  violence, an end to violence, and an acceptance that violence  will not solve the problems that we have on this island.""

Mr Spring said the IRA's actions over the past few days  appeared totally contradictory. ""On the one hand, they are  saying they are flexible, they want to look at the peace  process. At the same time, they are insulting the intelligence  of ordinary people by bombing Heathrow airport, threatening  innocent people in their daily lives.

His comments came as it emerged at Westminster that the government is unlikely to insist that all IRA weapons are surrendered in exchange for allowing Sinn Fein to join political talks on Northern Ireland's future. Hopes of further progress on the UK-Irish peace initiative were reinforced by the upbeat tone adopted by the British and Irish governments after the first meeting under the terms of the Anglo-Irish conference since last month's IRA ceasefire. Mr Dick Spring, Irish foreign minister, said after his talks with Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, in London that the two governments were coming closer in their attitude to the ceasefire. He hoped the two sides would have completed their work on the framework document designed to inject momentum into political talks involving the province's main political parties 'long before' Christmas. Questioned on the prospects for talks between the government and Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, Mr Major noted that republican leaders had still not provided sufficient assurances that the IRA had renounced violence for good. But if the assurances demanded by the government were given without delay, 'clearly we could be talking at or around Christmas-time', he said. Yesterday's developments came on the eve of the arrival in Boston of Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president. London has promised to start preliminary talks on how to admit Sinn Fein to the political process within three months of a permanent end to IRA violence. The ground covered would include what to do about the IRA's extensive armoury. Anything short of a full surrender of IRA weapons would probably disappoint unionists, many of whom remain profoundly suspicious of the IRA's intentions. According to Whitehall officials, London is unlikely to regard a refusal by republican leaders to guarantee that all IRA weapons have been handed in as a potential deal-breaker. There is widespread acceptance, however, that London is likely to take a much tougher line over caches of explosives and military equipment such as semi-automatic rifles and rocket launchers. That is the minimum that would be demanded by the moderate unionists whom it is vital for London to keep on board. According to Mr John Taylor, the Ulster Unionist MP for Strangford, there is 'no way in which the UUP could recognise Sinn Fein as a normal democratic political party . . . until those guns are accounted for'. Questioned on the issue yesterday, Sir Patrick Mayhew said nobody who had given up violence had 'any possible need for these things'.

0,FT941-2656 ,"FT941-2656 _AN-ECTARAB5FT 940319   FT  19 MAR 94 / Weary, wiser, but the fight goes on / Testing the depth of the IRA's commitment to its campaign of violence and asks when it might end      By MICHAEL CASSELL   As former IRA volunteers, Shane O'Doherty and Tommy McKearney were ready to kill for their cause and were incarcerated for their crimes. Now, they are united in wanting an end to armed struggle but ada mant that the British and Irish governments' Christmas peace initiative will not deliver it. Both men, each leavened by long spells in jail, are thoughtful, articulate and confound the caricature of block-headed warmongers painted by their opponents. Though they have left the IRA, their republican sympathies and some of their contacts survive. They dismiss as fanciful suggestions that 200 years of physical force against British 'occupation' is about to end. Neither believes the political initiative launched by London and Dublin  - in spite of high expectations of a historic breakthrough and the peace overtures of republican party Sinn Fein - has shifted the mindset of a paramilitary organisation hell-bent on a united Ireland. Mr O'Doherty was the IRA's chief bomb maker in Londonderry in the early 1970s before mounting a letter bomb campaign in 1973. His one-man war maimed and injured 12 people - Mr Reginald Maudling, then home secretary among them. Though he killed nobody he knew he might. He received 30 life sentences at the Old Bailey in 1976 and was freed in 1989. He is now, at 39, a pacifist, and has accused the IRA of dishonour and cowardice. Last year, he completed an English degree at Dublin University and lives in the city, regularly returning to the north to see his mother. He deeply regrets a past which provides him with a special insight into the present state of mind of hard-line republicans and into what might lie ahead. 'It was clear from the day it was published that the Downing Street declaration was going nowhere.' The declaration, signed by Mr John Major and Irish prime minister Mr Albert Reynolds, tried to square the aspirations of Northern Ireland's two main communities by offering rights of self-determination but guaranteeing Unionists that Northern Ireland would remain part ot the UK as long as they wished. 'We've put sticking plasters over Irish politics for centuries and once again the fundamental issues are being ducked. You cannot have two governments without proper constituencies in the north dictating solutions to a hardened, embittered double minority,' says Mr O'Doherty. So why should the IRA be able to? He concedes some IRA men have now reluctantly concluded - heresy until recently - that there will eventually have to be talks with the enemy. 'But many others still don't see the British deserving talks, they see them deserving bombs, no-warning bombs.' The impact of recent attacks on the mainland suggests, 'the probability is that a greater part of the campaign will move to Britain'. Mr McKearney, whose three brothers have died in terrorist violence, is no more optimistic about an end to IRA violence. He came out of jail in 1993 after serving 15 years for the murder of a part-time soldier in the Ulster Defence Regiment, part of the UK army. Now he is home again, living with his welcoming, elderly parents in a neat bungalow on a hillside in South Tyrone. He says the Downing Street declaration - the very title calculated, he says, to make republicans wince  -has altered nothing. 'This is not a sea-change. This is exactly where we were before. It is the status quo and I resent both governments suggesting anyone who rejects it must be some form of lunatic.' He adds: 'The Downing Street document was a fait accompli guaranteeing the union for ever and a day. Forty per cent of those in the north are annexed into a state against their will and don't want a UK connection while 50 per cent reject Dublin. We need new thinking to produce a mutually acceptable compromise.' But if new thinking is what is needed, more violence may be all that is on offer: 'The question the IRA asks itself is how does it keep the issue in front of the British until proper negotiations take place? Bombs and bullets will not resolve the conflict but have kept the organisation in the picture.' Both men quickly expose the yawning gap in understanding between republicans and British governments of all persuasions which has fuelled the fight and in 25 years prematurely terminated 3,000 lives. London and Dublin win almost universal domestic and international support for insisting upon a permanent cessation of violence before talks. 'The IRA is expected to trust perfidious Albion? It is, in any case, arrogant to suggest the violence and terrorism is one-sided, that the IRA is the offender and the British are peacemakers,' says Mr O'Doherty, who joined the IRA in protest at the 1972 Bloody Sunday killings, when 13 civilians were shot dead by British troops. 'Britain tries to hijack the moral high ground as though it has nothing to answer for. It has injured people on the streets, immunised its own murderers from prosecution and committed terrible injustices. 'There are three armed struggles in Northern Ireland involving the IRA, the loyalist paramilitaries and the British. We are all covered in blood and all carry the responsibility for the mess and for clearing it up. The IRA will not lay down its weaponry and put a question-mark over the moral value of its struggle and the sacrifices of its volunteers on the basis of the deal on offer.' Both men believe the British government will swing on the hook of hypocrisy in its refusal to talk. 'They talked to the IRA during two ceasefires in 1972 and 1974, they have been talking again in the last three years and they talked during and after the Warrington bombs,' says Mr O'Doherty. 'We all know lines of communication have been open since the hunger strikes. Which is the principle at stake that has not already been breached?' asks Mr McKearney. So what must happen, in the eyes of hardline republicans, if the anguish is ever to end? The British government will first, says Mr O'Doherty, be expected to show some humility in a declaration repenting for 'centuries of injustice'. At the same time, he believes, the IRA will not countenance an end to armed struggle without the repatriation and eventual release of prisoners to whom it is unswervingly loyal. The British government has insisted there can be no amnesty for people who are not political prisoners but simply guilty of vicious crimes. According to Mr O'Doherty: 'The IRA will not have the British talk about a peace which entails the continuing retention of IRA prisoners. If the provisionals held hostages in return, would the British claim the conditions existed for a settlement?' Both men agree that the big failure in republican thinking is to see the British government as the only key to peace. A million unionists, acknowledges Mr O'Doherty, will not be suppressed, and they will have to be courted in the same way the British government must deal with the IRA. Unionists have to be reassured that, in any new arrangement, their constitutional rights are guaranteed, says Mr McKearney. He suggests 'something like a confederation or a unitary state or a canton which breaks the connection with the UK but does not necessarily involve parting'. Mr O'Doherty has in mind Britain and Ireland sharing sovereignty and responsibility for the north. Such language renders unionists apoplectic and London and Dublin unmoved. The governments insist on a ceasefire, underwrite the democratic will of the majority and restate their commitment to a peace initiative which, in trying to be all things to all people, threatens to satisfy none. The history of Northern Ireland, however, is replete with surprising ironies as well as tragedy. Both Mr McKearney and Mr O'Doherty spent several years in the same jail as the loyalist paramilitaries they were pledged to kill. They talked and mixed and came to see other side's point of view. They even struck up friendships. The trick is to repeat it in the world outside.   Countries:-  IEZ  Ireland, EC.   Industries:-  P8651 Political Organizations.   Types:-  CMMT  Comment  Analysis.

Their statement came as Mr John Major and Mr Albert Reynolds responded to the escalating violence in the province by announcing a new drive towards a political settlement. A joint communique issued by the two leaders after talks in Brussels said there could be no question of contacts with terrorists, but that 'new doors' would open if the IRA and its supporters renounced violence for good. In his most explicit recognition yet of a potential role for Sinn Fein, Mr Major agreed that the political wing of the IRA could eventually be brought into the peace process. The two governments said they would 'respond imaginatively' to a permanent cessation of violence. However, the British and Irish prime ministers rejected as a basis for peace the conclusions of recent talks between Mr John Hume of the SDLP and Mr Gerry Adams of Sinn Fein. There could be 'no question' of the two governments adopting or endorsing Mr Hume's report of the dialogue. Details of those talks were reported yesterday for the first time to Mr Major by Mr Reynolds. At the end of a week of the worst sectarian violence for two decades, the two leaders condemned the tit-for-tat killings by terrorists from the Catholic and Protestant communities. Their communique attacked the 'murderous and premeditated acts which could serve no end other than to deepen the bloodshed in Northern Ireland'. Mr Major and Mr Reynolds reaffirmed their determination to restart the stalled negotiating process designed to bring a permanent political settlement to the province. Their cautiously upbeat tone followed the Dublin government's acknowledgement earlier this week of the right of the Unionist community to exercise a permanent veto on changes in Ulster's constitutional status. Both sides confirmed that the essence of any agreement would be a move by the Republic to replace its constitutional claim to the province with the aspiration of a united Ireland. Britain in return would offer a significant extension of cross-border administration. But the communique glossed over significant differences on the extent to which elements of the Hume-Adams peace initiative could be incorporated into their own negotiations. Mr Reynolds told Mr Major that they could not ignore the potential for a cessation of violence by the IRA in return for a place at the negotiating table for Sinn Fein. But, speaking after their talks, Mr Major said there could be 'no talks or negotiations between democratic governments and those who use, threaten or support violence'.

Few commentators in Dublin can remember a time in the 10 weeks since the IRA ceasefire in which the Irish premier has been quite so reticent about taking centre stage on a policy which he has orchestrated almost single-handedly from the Irish side. After his government's decision to rescind its programme of IRA prisoner releases, it was left to the hapless justice minister, Mrs Maire Geoghegan-Quinn, normally a sure-footed performer, to explain the about-turn. The Dublin government has often warned of the dangers of leaving large numbers of republicans behind bars once a ceasefire was in place. It argued a goodwill gesture was needed to bolster the moderate voice in the IRA. Mrs Geoghegan-Quinn was adamant that at no time did the government plan the release of more than nine prisoners, in spite of newspaper reports in the republic that as many as 30 convicted terrorists were being considered. Her government colleagues were yesterday quick to applaud her robust defence of the policy reversal. Only Sinn Fein expressed outright disappointment. Another surprise was the absence of any murmur of discontent from civil liberties groups. Some politicians, however, privately wondered about the consistency - having offered to release the prisoners - of withdrawing the concession because of an event 60 miles away in another state. Not only the release programme has been put on hold. Dublin is reviewing its whole approach to the peace process. Where days ago a cross-party consensus had prevailed in the republic in support of Mr Reynolds' efforts, the opposition yesterday seemed to have a renewed bounce in its step. Both governments insist the peace process is on track. Mr Dick Spring, the republic's foreign minister, and Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, are due to meet in Dublin on Monday about progress on the framework document. The Northern Ireland Office said yesterday that nothing had changed its 'working assumption' that the IRA had ceased its military operations. Exploratory talks with Sinn Fein about the 'practical consequences' of the ceasefire may start this year. They would cover the decommissioning of arms and explosives, and the steps required to return Sinn Fein to democratic politics and the bilateral talks. But the Newry murder and Sinn Fein's less than frank explanation underline the danger of taking its assurances on the permanence of the ceasefire at face value without first verifying the disposal of arms and explosives. 'It will certainly make us more cautious,' said a UK government official. The Newry tragedy has underscored British concerns that the issue of arms and explosives must be addressed before full political negotiations can begin, in spite of the insistence of Mr Martin McGuinness, Sinn Fein vice-president, that the issue is 'down the road'. The main outstanding question is whether the Newry attack was carried out by a renegade republican unit or whether it was in some way at the behest of the IRA's central command. If the former, then there seems no reason why London should not begin discussing the handing in of arms with republican leaders before the end of the year, as previously envisaged. Indeed, the incident might even play a part in helping to convince the leadership of Sinn Fein that it has something to gain from the surrender of at least some IRA weaponry at a relatively early stage in the peace process. But if the raid was sanctioned by IRA leaders, then the UK government's so-called working assumption that the IRA ceasefire was permanent would be under severe pressure. It is hard to see under those circumstances how a severe delay in preliminary dialogue between London and republican leaders could be avoided. Thursday's attack also underlines the importance of efforts being made by senior British and Irish officials to develop a co-ordinated approach to dismantling paramilitary arsenals, as agreed at Chequers last month. Mr John Major, UK prime minister, said the discussions would concentrate on the 'logistics and mechanics' of arranging for weapons held by paramilitaries to be handed over. It is almost certain that these discussions will have continued at yesterday's meeting of the liaison committee of British and Irish officials in Dublin. Sir Patrick and Mr Spring will be under pressure to say more on Monday about the substance of the committee's deliberations.   Countries:-  IEZ  Ireland, EC.     GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

0,FT943-2819 ,"FT943-2819 _AN-EIRAQAAFFT 940917   FT  17 SEP 94 / Major offers Ulster a vote on results of peace talks: Sinn Fein challenged to end ceasefire doubts as broadcast ban is lifted      By DAVID OWEN and JIMMY BURNS   Mr John Major yesterday moved to speed up the Northern Ireland peace process by lifting the government's broadcasting ban on Sinn Fein and challenging the party to end doubt about the permanence of the IRA's ceasefire. But the prime minister balanced this with his first unequivocal commitment to submit the outcome of political talks to a referendum inside the province. He also gave his clearest assurance yet to unionists that last month's ceasefire announcement was not the result of a secret deal, insisting: 'The cessation of violence has not been bought.' Separately, Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, ordered the re-opening of 10 Ulster border crossings. Mr Major said this was 'emphatically not a political decision' and was taken on security grounds. The abolition of the broadcasting ban means the voices of Sinn Fein's representatives will be heard on Britain's airwaves for the first time in almost six years. Mr Major's attempt to regain the initiative follows mounting pressure from Dublin and Ulster nationalists over the past two weeks for him to respond more positively to last month's IRA announcement. Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, welcomed the moves announced by Mr Major and indicated a similar referendum would be held in the Irish Republic. Speaking in Belfast, Mr Major sought to put the onus for starting the countdown to Sinn Fein's involvement in the talks process squarely on republican leaders by making it clear he was still not satisfied the IRA had renounced violence permanently. Britain has promised to start talks on how to admit Sinn Fein to the political process within three months of a permanent end to violence. The government would 'go on scrutinising both words and actions until . . . we can sensibly make the assumption that the IRA truly intend to end violence for good', he said. The date on which the three-month period started was 'in Sinn Fein's hands. If they are able to say to me tonight, 'We have ended violence not just for a short time but in all circumstances and for all time', then the clock can start ticking before midnight'. But in Londonderry last night, Mr Martin McGuinness, the deputy leader of Sinn Fein, refused to be drawn into declaring the IRA's ceasefire permanent. Instead he repeated his earlier comment that the IRA's cease-fire covered 'all circum-stances'. Describing the lifting of border controls and of the broadcasting ban as a 'healthy development', he said Sinn Fein would take the 'next few weeks' before deciding its position on a referendum. However, he warned: 'The conflict will not be resolved until it is resolved on all-Ireland basis.' Mr Major emphasised that 'neither we nor the main constitutional parties can sit down at the table with them to negotiate under even the possibility of a threat'. In a clear attempt to reassure unionists, Mr Major said his commitment to a referendum meant it would be for the Ulster electorate to decide whether to accept any package of proposals emerging from political talks. 'My commitment means that no one can go behind your backs,' he said. 'It will be for you to decide.' Mr Peter Robinson MP, deputy leader of the Democratic Unionist party, said the prime minister's speech was 'an advance'. However he believed it 'fell short' in that the prime minister was 'still capable of taking decisions outside the talks process without the consent of the people'. The prime minister said the broadcasting restrictions were no longer serving the purpose for which they were intended. All paramilitaries now had the opportunity to 'tell us directly . . . that they are truly committed to peaceful methods only, and to there being no resumption of violence in future', he said. In recent months, ministers have come around to the view that the broadcasting ban had become a weapon for critics of the government, but they were anxious not to antagonise moderate unionists and Tory backbenchers by lifting it prematurely. Yesterday's announcement comes eight months after Dublin lifted its broadcasting ban on Sinn Fein, and a day after the first full meeting of the British cabinet since the summer. Mr Reynolds, on a visit to Hong Kong, said the British and Irish governments were considering the formation of a cross-border tourism organisation.

0,FT943-8274 ,"FT943-8274 _AN-EHRD3ACAFT 940818   FT  18 AUG 94 / More pass A-levels in spite of smaller entry      By JOHN AUTHERS   The number of school pupils passing GCE A-level examinations in England, Wales and Northern Ireland reached a record this year in spite of a 4 per cent reduction in the number of 18-year-olds, the government announced today. But falling applications for science subjects accentuated concern raised this week by a government inspectors' report which found that in England and Wales 'not all science and mathematics teachers have the skills and talents required to do their job'. The numbers taking physics at A-level fell 5.8 per cent following a fall of 9.6 per cent last year. Chemistry entries rose by 0.6 per cent, but this still left numbers short of their 1992 levels following a 4.5 per cent fall last year. Instead, there was an increase of 15.5 per cent in the 'all other subjects' category, which includes film, theatre, and media studies. Economics suffered the single greatest fall in applications, of 15.2 per cent, following 10 per cent last year, as students seem instead to be increasingly attracted to business studies, up 9.9 per cent. While the numbers attempting the exams fell only 0.4 per cent compared with last year's record high entry, pass rates improved significantly, meaning that there were more passes. The proportion passing with at least a grade C - usually the level required by universities - rose 2.2 percentage points, while the share of candidates managing at least a pass grade E rose 1.8 percentage points. Mr Eric Forth, the schools minister, welcomed the result and made a strong defence of the qualification, in spite of calls for its abolition by the Labour party. He said: 'Today's results prove that GCE A-levels remain popular and are more successful than ever before. They are a world-renowned trademark of Britain's educational excellence.' He said the government remained committed to the exams, which would continue to be offered alongside general national vocational qualification (GNVQs). He predicted that more students would 'mix and match' A-level and vocational qualifications. Ms Kathleen Tattersall, chief executive of the Northern Examinations and Assessment Board who speaks for the GCE boards, said the better results had been driven by 'increased competition for university places and jobs, combined with improvements in the preparation and presentation of students for examinations'. But teachers gave the figures a more cautious welcome. Ms Gillian Wood, assistant general secretary of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, said: 'The number of young people who leave school or college with a qualification at 18 is still far too low. 'We not only need to maintain the quality of A-levels but also to widen the range of opportunities for youngsters to encourage them to stay on at school or college.'

As the British and US governments continue to refrain from full acceptance of the ceasefire, Mr Taylor, the MP for Strangford, Co Down, came as close as any unionist to admitting that the IRA had fully renounced violence. 'My gut reaction is that the ceasefire is for real,' he told his constituency association. Mr Taylor, who was seriously wounded by an IRA gunman in 1972, added: 'I consider it to be my responsibility to encourage the peace process forward so that there will eventually be lasting peace.' He was clearly at odds with another unionist MP, Mr David Trimble, who claimed that the UUP's view was that the IRA had no intention of abandoning their campaign unless there were substantial concessions from the government. Writing in the Belfast Telegraph, Mr Trimble, the MP for Upper Bann, said that the ceasefire was a 'gamble' by the IRA. 'They reckon that if they fail to gain concessions, the blame for resumed violence can be placed on the British government or the loyalists.' Ulster Unionists will have been pleased with comments yesterday by Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, that the transfer of four republican terrorists from English jails to Northern Ireland only hours after the IRA ceasefire began had been 'completely wrong'.

The new caution reads: 'You do not have to say anything. But if you do not mention now something which you later use in your defence the court may decide that your failure to mention it now strengthens the case against you. A record will be made of anything you say and it may be given if you are brought to trial.' The present caution is: 'You do not have to say anything unless you wish to do so but what you say may be given in evidence.' Mr Howard said the new caution contained three sentences. 'I don't think that's very long-winded and use of a caution in very similar terms in Northern Ireland does not appear to have given rise to any problems.' Mr Alun Michael, Labour home affairs spokesman, said it meant the 'vulnerable and those of low ability' would be at risk. Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Mr Robert Maclennan said the new caution was 'an inelegant tongue-twister and a real mouthful which could be easily misunderstood in the heat of the moment.' The all-party law reform group Justice said the proposed caution would be difficult for suspects to understand and for police officers to remember.

0,FT941-15586 ,"FT941-15586 _AN-EANDNACIFT 940114   FT  14 JAN 94 / Ulster's hopes begin to fade: Prospects for the Downing St declaration      By PHILIP STEPHENS   The air of anxious expectation has all but evaporated. The most ambitious attempt in 25 years of violence to persuade the IRA to swap the gun for the ballot box looks like running into Ulster's blood-stained ground. There are still faint hopes. No one can second-guess the IRA leadership with any certainty. But Mr John Major's government is on the verge of acknowledging that there is no immediate prospect of an end to the killing. There are no regrets in Whitehall. Many of the politicians and officials who negotiated last month's Downing Street declaration did so as much in hope as expectation. Even if, as the government now expects, the hawks in the IRA insist that the military campaign continues, the UK-Irish declaration might yet prove the foundation stone for peace. The IRA has been isolated internationally. The mood in Northern Ireland has changed. Mr Major's disavowal of any selfish or strategic British interest in the province will render the republican charge of imperialist occupation that much harder to make stick. Ministers remain hopeful that they have made a small start to a process which will lead to the progressive isolation of the men of violence. So if Mr Major is being blamed for everything else these days, few at Westminster will retract the praise with which they greeted a courageous initiative. Nor will the government's expected decision to press on without Sinn Fein with the search for an internal political settlement in Ulster close the door to the possibility of peace. Mr Major will make it clear that the talks process cannot be paralysed indefinitely by Sinn Fein's public equivocation. But that does not mean that the offer of a place at the negotiating table will be retracted. The Downing Street declaration will not be withdrawn. The British government is not going to tell the IRA that because it has not stopped killing by the end of this month, it has no alternative but to go on doing so. In the words of one insider, the IRA will continue to hold the key which could unlock the door to peace. Nor should we expect the draconian security clampdown predicted by some in the province. On one level it is simply unrealistic. As long as Northern Ireland remains part of a democracy, there is not much more the government can do beyond the measures already in place. On another, it would be foolish to allow the hardliners in the IRA to claim that they had been right all along in rejecting the peace initiative. Internment - or selective detention as it is now known - remains a real option if the violence threatens to escalate out of control. But without an equivalent move in the republic, the costs could be higher than the benefits. The government has not changed its view that there is a significant faction at the highest levels of the IRA in favour of a political settlement. For all his attacks on Mr Major in recent days, Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, is still seen as a dove. Viewed from London, the position of Mr Martin McGuinness appears more obscure. In spite of his repeated denials of involvement in the military campaign, Mr McGuinness is said to be the chief of staff of the IRA. The assessment in London is that in recent weeks his stance has straddled the peace and war factions. But overall, the opaque picture which emerges from the intelligence reports circulating around Whitehall is that the opposing camps of IRA doves and hawks have concluded that no deal could be struck without splitting the movement. Mr Adams and his allies are unwilling or unable to contemplate that prospect. For his part Mr Major indicated again yesterday that he will not be drawn into the dialogue sought by Mr Adams to 'clarify' the Downing Street declaration. In London's view the Sinn Fein leader is seeking negotiation, not clarification. His recent insistence that Sinn Fein could take no decisions until its convention at the end of February is seen as part of the same strategy. Mr Major must be conscious, however, that it will not be easy to relaunch talks on a political settlement without Sinn Fein. Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish premier, has invested too much political capital in the exercise to admit now that it has failed. He is likely to press for further efforts - clarification if necessary - to entice the IRA to the negotiating table. The prime minister will also have to persuade Mr John Hume, leader of Ulster's mainly Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party, that he is not giving up too soon. Without the agreement of Mr Reynolds and Mr Hume there is no prospect of a deal among the province's constitutional parties.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

0,FT944-18593 ,"FT944-18593 _AN-EJCE7AEAFT 941003   FT  03 OCT 94 / Blair's 'crusade for change' undermined by tension over tax      By KEVIN BROWN and PHILIP STEPHENS      BLACKPOOL   Tension over Labour's tax plans for the middle classes yesterday undermined Mr Tony Blair's efforts to secure a trouble-free conference debut as party leader. As party officials cleared the way for compromises on minimum wages, women's rights and Northern Ireland, Mr Blair sought to set the tone for the conference in a statement promising a 'crusade for change'. His comments came as Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, outlined a comprehensive series of measures being considered as part of Labour's industrial regeneration plan. He emphasised in an interview with the Financial Times that a Labour government would seek a partnership with business rather than seek to direct it and said the priority was to tackle short-termism and to promote greater investment in training. Mr Brown will also use the opening of today's debate on the economy to underline the party leadership's commitment to modernising the welfare state. He will signal Labour's plans to integrate the tax and benefit system for pensioners and to use the benefit system to remove work disincentives for the unemployed. Mr Brown played down remarks by Mr John Prescott, the deputy leader, which appeared to signal support for higher taxes for the better off. He said Mr Prescott's view was in line with Mr Blair, who pledged in his statement that 'people who generate ideas, jobs and wealth have nothing to fear from a Labour government'. However, Mr Prescott said on independent television's Walden programme that Labour had given no promises to any groups of voters on taxation. Mr Blair's efforts to modernise the party were repeatedly attacked at pre-conference fringe meetings by leftwing activists accusing him of seeking to compete with the Conservatives in running a market economy. The leadership was more embarrassed by disclosures that delegates from many big unions will be told how to vote by union leaders, undermining the abolition of the union block vote at last year's conference. Mr Blair insisted that last year's conference decision to scrap block voting stood. He told Sky News: 'Last October, the block vote was finished, it died.

Senior party officials were confident that a threatened row over the party's commitment to a minimum wage had been averted by a compromise resolution referring the issue to a commission due to report next year. The resolution confirms Labour's commitment to a legally enforceable national minimum wage pegged to half the level of male median earnings, but meets Mr Blair's concern that the party should avoid specifying a figure.

Its position as a supplier of own-label foods to the likes of Marks and Spencer and Sainsbury is a strength. Yet problems arise when this migration becomes a stampede. Last year's price war among supermarket giants drew customers away from local stores in droves. Doorstep milk deliveries fell by 12 per cent. Since these outlets account for a large slice of Northern's business, profits across the group barely grew. For all its efforts to rationalise distribution to smaller stores and franchise milk rounds, this year will be equally tough if food prices continue to fall. In addition to declining volumes on the non-supermarket side, Northern will have to fight its corner on margins with the supermarkets themselves. Grabbing a decent share of the wholesale milk market once it is open to competition would help cement Northern's position in this area. But the immediate impact on profits is unlikely to be great. While the earnings outlook is dull, Northern continues to generate cash. Financing modest acquisitions would present no problem even though capital spending is running well ahead of depreciation. Yet for the moment the equity market is more interested in recovery stories than other virtues. The shares stand at little more than half 1991's rights price. If the equity market is not prepared to value fully a cash-generative and strategically well-positioned company, others in the food industry may be tempted to step in.

0,FT923-13748 ,"FT923-13748 _AN-CGLAFAB7FT 920711   FT  11 JUL 92 / Belfast is 'a clean, crisp Hibernian Rio' (official): The Northern Ireland Tourist Board believes battle-scarred West Belfast could attract visitors. Tim Burt looks at the changes which make the notion plausible      By TIM BURT   TONIGHT is bonfire night in Belfast. Piles of old timber and rubbish are ready to burn and hundreds of Protestant children, some younger than 10 years old, are looking forward to the big event: the annual celebration of the Battle of the Boyne. Each year, the fires send a pall of smoke across hardline suburbs, reminding Roman Catholic communities of their rout in 1690 at the hands of William of Orange. Army helicopters sometimes help spread the smoke as they hover over the crowds, shining spotlights through the haze. And yet the Northern Ireland Tourist Board sees hardline areas as a potential attraction. It suggests visitors seeking a glimpse of the trouble spots should be encouraged. The board's corporate plan says: 'The opportunity to harness this curiosity factor should not be overlooked as a positive factor in encouraging people to visit and understand Northern Ireland.' The invitation from the tourist board contrasts with the advice I was given seven years ago by the Royal Ulster Constabulary. The policeman who questioned me thumped his bullet proof vest and said: 'The Provos are trying to kill me. What protection can I give you - a Brit - on my doorstep? I can't do anything if they lift you . . . my advice is get out of West Belfast.' I was about to be charged under the Prevention of Terrorism Act for gathering information which might be useful to a terrorist. Taking pictures of security bases is forbidden in Northern Ireland and I was an easy catch, spotted outside the Woodburn army base by high-powered surveillance cameras mounted on a pylon over the streets. Tension was high then. More than 27 policeman had been killed that year and the security forces were edgy. Tension is expected to rise again tonight with the bonfires. The security forces will be on the look out for 'clodding' - stone-throwing battles which often lead to serious violence. In the worst parts of West Belfast stones give way to Molotov cocktails or condom bombs, home-made explosives filled with chemicals and acid. You can tell condom bombs by the terrible smell. Gelignite has the sweet aroma of marzipan. Shopkeepers will spend the night in cars outside their premises. They claim the police will not answer calls about burglaries and looting for fear of being set up for a terrorist attack. Officers say they can keep an eye on many premises from the security of police stations using the type of surveillance cameras which caught me. The RUC hope any trouble will die out by daybreak. Tomorrow is the actual anniversary of the battle between William of Orange and James II, but the traditional Orange Day marches have been postponed until Monday out of the respect for the sabbath. The interlude should give Belfast time to clean up before the Protestant celebration begins afresh with a two-day public holiday. The uniforms and tunes of the marchers have not changed in years, nor have the routes they try to take through sectarian areas. But the landscape of West Belfast is undergoing a slow and painful facelift. Fewer shops and offices are protected by wire grilles; two new shopping centres have been built on the site of the old Eastwoods scrapyard; and whole areas of derelict housing have been razed to make way for new homes. Divis, the notorious republican ghetto which marks the gateway to West Belfast, is being demolished as part of a Pounds 9m investment scheme. The high-rise blocks have been one of the main targets of the state Housing Executive which has built almost 1,000 new homes a year since 1982. The redevelopment scheme, part of a Pounds 200m urban rehabilitation programme, stretches from the Royal Victoria Hospital - the site of the former Belfast and District Lunatic Asylum - to the River Lagan on the fringe of the city. It has helped to reclaim waste ground and provided the impetus for Europe's largest community-led environmental project: Colin Glen, a spectacular park which cuts a green swathe through the western suburbs. These changes have helped make West Belfast into an area that is, in the eyes of the tourist board, fit for visitors. Unionist politicians have reacted angrily to the board's proposals, claiming tourist officials are trying to package the troubles for outsiders. A claim which the officials reject. They are not the only ones who take a kindlier view of tourists. Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, offers tourists a guide to the protest murals and army bases. And privately, police officers say visitors are unlikely to be detained for taking pictures of security installations. Many of the improvements, however, are only cosmetic. Smart railings have replaced the concrete blocks that used to line grassy areas of the city to deter joyriders. But joyriding is as prevalent as ever. The local economy has been drained by years of neglect during which the government directed investment to areas of political preferment. That has left unemployment averaging 36.7 per cent, rising to more than 60 per cent in pockets of the Catholic Falls Road and Protestant Shankhill Road. With little prospect of work, many low income families live on estates suffering from vandalism and apathy. Most Belfast children never encounter violence or see a bomb thrown, but those who face the dole are not so lucky. They are ripe for racketeering and paramilitary recruitment. The tourist board ignores all this and describes Belfast as 'crisp, clean and inviting . . . a Hibernian Rio'. If the city centre compares to that Brazilian metropolis, then West Belfast is its favela: spirited but poor. There is, however, a group of entrepreneurs backed by the Industrial Development Board, which sees investment as the panacea for the problems. The West Belfast Business Opportunity group claims an enterprise culture is flourishing, with new companies taking advantage of cheap premises and labour. The economic optimism has been fuelled by this week's face-to-face talks between Ulster leaders and the British and Irish governments. Local community leaders say there is a ripple of hope rather than a wave. Too many residents have had expectations raised before only to see them dashed by industrial closures, recession and violence. The Phoenix Trust, a development group, says there is still 'severe multiple deprivation'. Eamon Hanna, chief executive of the trust, says: 'This would be a problem town even if a shot had never been fired . . . it's an uphill battle.' Hanna and other business leaders say winning the economic battle depends on overcoming the area's poor image. That image could take a further knock this weekend if the bonfires become a prelude to violence and the clodding persuades outsiders to follow the advice I received - get out of West Belfast.

0,FT943-4141 ,"FT943-4141 _AN-EIKACABFFT 940910   FT  10 SEP 94 / Adams likely to be given US visa      By JIMMY BURNS, JAMES BLITZ and JAMES HARDING      BELFAST, LONDON, WASHINGTON   Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, last night looked likely to be granted a visa to visit the US as he moved to raise his political profile in the Northern Ireland peace process. He said yesterday that he had received 'thousands of invitations' from the US to explain the recent ceasefire declaration by Sinn Fein and the IRA, and he planned to visit as soon as possible. Mr Adams is barred from visiting the US, and his application aims to test how receptive the Washington and London governments are to the recent IRA ceasefire. A State Department official said in Washington last night that no formal visa request had been received. But if his intention was to advance the peace process Mr Adams would probably receive one. The official was also reported to have said that the Clinton administration was considering a request from a unionist delegation to visit Washington. 'I think it's safe to say that the US is going to - as President Clinton said - support this effort of peace in every possible way,' the official said. Mr Adams last applied for - and obtained - a US visa in February in spite of a strong public protest from the British government that the IRA had not renounced violence. On that occasion the White House overruled the advice of State Department officials and agreed to a 72-hour visit by Mr Adams, having become convinced that it would contribute to the peace process. White House officials who feel vindicated by that decision are likely to recommend granting a visa again, although the State Department remains sensitive to the complex issues at stake. The State Department yesterday also pointed out that the US admitted Mr Joseph Cahill, a Provisional IRA leader with a criminal conviction, at the end of last month. Senator Chris Dodd yesterday met Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish premier and suggested that Mr Adams, Mr Reynolds and Mr John Hume, leader of the mainly nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party, should visit the US to participate in a hearing on the future of Ireland before the Senate foreign relations committee. Mr Dodd, as chairman of the subcommittee on western hemisphere and Peace Corps affairs, would be one of the senators responsible for inviting Mr Adams on behalf of the Senate committee. Political aides to Mr Dodd said yesterday that the senator believes there should be a role for the US in Irish reconciliation and that 'Mr Adams should sit at the table'. The British government may formally urge President Clinton not to grant Mr Adams a visa until the IRA gives a firmer indication that it has permanently abandoned its military campaign. But officials are aware that the survival of the IRA ceasefire depends in large measure on Mr Adams being able to show his supporters that the 'unarmed struggle' is producing political results. Mr Adams plans to give his next US trip a higher profile than his last one, hoping he will be heralded as a peacemaker and not a terrorist. Will they bid for peace?

Sisu-Auto Oy in turn received  permission to export bulletproof Nasu all-terrain trucks to  Turkey.    In the explanation of the law regulating the exportation of  defense goods from the country it is stated, among other things,  that exportation of the goods is not permitted to crisis regions  or to countries in which there are serious human rights  violations.    Aapo Polho, office director in the Ministry of Foreign  Affairs, asks if it is not true that human rights violations of  the type that occurred with the Indonesian occupation of East  Timor would prevent arms exports to Indonesia.    ""The matter cannot be simplified in this way. The government  has decided that the CSCE and EU [European Union] criteria,  which are considerably more precise than the Finnish law, which  leaves a good deal of room for interpretation, will also be used  as bases for licensing. At present neither Indonesia nor Turkey  is the object of sanctions by the UN Security Council or the EU.  Finland condemns human rights violations in East Timor just as  elsewhere.    ``A working group headed by the Ministry of Defense recently  considered how the EU and CSCE criteria would be applied in  Finland. In practice it would mean that supervision would expand  to cover many more products than at present, for example cameras  and computer programs intended to be a part of certain weapon  systems.''    Has the export licensing policy been relaxed or is it being  relaxed somewhat?    ""Licensing policy is neither being tightened nor relaxed in  applying the EU and CSCE criteria -- it is just being made more  precise. The present law permits a situation in which the  interpretations change even monthly. In this case it is  difficult for manufacturers to plan their output. For preserving  Finland's defense capability it is important that Finland also  have an arms industry.""    Bulletproof all-terrain trucks may be exported to Turkey.  Are  the Nasus of such a civilian nature that they may be exported  anywhere at all?    ""It depends a little on how they are equipped. Those that  are  bulletproofed require a license, but those that are not  protected do not.""    May Nasus without bulletproofing be exported to Sudan,  Somalia, or Burundi, for example?    ""Their exportation in principle does not require a license  at  all, but according to the new lists that are being prepared,  they too will be included in the monitoring without further ado.""    May mortars be exported to Great Britain although it is  waging war in Northern Ireland?    ""Yes. There is no state of war there but rather the  disturbances in Northern Ireland involve problems of internal  security.""     "
0,FT944-16050 ,"FT944-16050 _AN-EJPAHAAXFT 941015   FT  15 OCT 94 / The Conservatives in Bournemouth: Tories wave the union flag at Blair      By DAVID OWEN   Mr Ian Lang yesterday pledged that the future of the union would be at the heart of the next general election campaign by the Conservative party - as he used the issue to launch a sustained attack on Mr Tony Blair. Signalling that the party's high command thinks it has found a weapon with which to pierce the new Labour leader's armour, the Scottish secretary devoted fully one-third of his speech to picking apart Labour's commitment to devolution for Scotland and Wales. In a speech that earned him a two-minute standing ovation, Mr Lang conjured up a picture of a Labour government hamstrung in its first year by its promise of a bill to set up a Scottish parliament and a Welsh assembly. The bill would be opposed tooth and nail and would take up 'the entire parliamentary session' he said. It represented for the moment 'the sum total of the Blair agenda'. He added: 'It is an agenda that is undeliverable. And it represents a failure of judgment of massive proportions.' As speaker after speaker came to the podium to defend the union Mr Adrian Lee, national chairman of the Young Conservatives, said he hoped there would be no return to devolved government in Ulster. He said: 'Unequivocal unionism is not only principled but it wins votes. If devolution is wrong in Scotland, England and Wales, why is it right in Northern Ireland?' Addressing this question later, Mr Lang argued that the circumstances of North-ern Ireland were different. 'I am not averse to having different arrangements within an integrated United Kingdom parliament,' he said. 'Northern Ireland has a democratic deficit, Scotland does not.' Mr Lang warned that Scotland would have to pay 'a heavy price' for the creation of a Scottish parliament, with questions such as the level of Scottish representation at Westminster and Scottish MPs' right to vote on all UK matters coming under scrutiny. He said the government could not go on earmarking funds to ensure 'a level standard of public services' if Scotland were given the power to raise and lower its own taxes. But he acknowledged that Scotland could pull out of the union if it ever became 'the preponderant and settled view' of the Scots that that was what they wanted to do. Mr OJ Williams, a Conservative from Carmarthen, west Wales, said the party was not opposed to 'true' devolution, meaning the removal of tiers of administration to give individuals choice over their own lives. The other parties believed in devolving power to institutions not individuals. The real reason they wanted to do that was to keep power for themselves. Ms Nanette Milne, an Aberdeen councillor, said it was wrong to assume the whole of Scotland was 'crying out' for constitutional change. She said many people were afraid that devolution would create divisions between Scotland's different regions. There was 'a real fear' of rule by 'red Clydesiders' and 'power-hungry Scottish socialists' if a separate Scottish parliament was set up.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

0,FT942-7417 ,"FT942-7417 _AN-EEYDRAGSFT 940525   FT  25 MAY 94 / Survey of Ireland (2): The boat has stayed afloat - Angela Long examines the economy and employment prospects      By ANGELA LONG   Whither the economy of Ireland? Or should that be 'wither'? The Republic has advantages in its highly educated, youthful workforce, its (often perplexingly) healthy economic indicators and its enthusiasm to attract investment from foreign companies. But nothing can deny its geography, and after the Channel Tunnel starts operating at last, Ireland will indeed be the only European Union country without a direct link to the European land mass. Well may Mr Albert Reynolds, the Taoiseach, claim that while geographically peripheral, Ireland was 'at the heart of Europe' - as he declared to a meeting of the Irish Management Institute last month. Dependence on Europe, primarily the UK, is a fact of life for the Irish economy. A population of 3m is not enough to sustain a country in isolation, and so Ireland has to look outwards, which perhaps accounts for the much more continental feel that Dublin has, for example, than any English city. Often, because of blood links, the overseas link is with the US. This year has seen growing optimism for the Irish economy. Predictions of growth have risen from near 3 per cent at the end of 1993 to between 4 per cent and 5 per cent. Inflation, at about 2 per cent, is one of the lowest in the EU, comparable only with France. The punt is healthy, and a leading stockbroker, Davy, recently predicted that it could reach parity with sterling by the end of the year. Exchequer returns, a key indication of how the administration's bookkeeping is faring, were good, showing a 25 per cent increase in total tax revenue for the first quarter of 1994. And although Ireland may still be one of the poorer members of the EU, its relative prosperity is improving: average income has risen from 60 per cent of the EU average in 1986 to 74 per cent today. The Reynolds government, with Mr Bertie Ahern a popular and competent finance minister, has kept its head and ridden out the currency storm. Interest rates are fairly stable. The government is entering its second Programme for Economic and Social Partnership (PESP), which features a tripartite agreement between itself, the unions and employers, which should help to restrain wage levels. Public sector pay, however, may prove harder to control than Mr Reynolds and Mr Ahern have hoped, with civil servants using provisions for increased pay as a result of work restructuring. Another awkward acronym to ride with PESP, the PCW, stands for the Programme for Competitiveness and Work. The name may be clumsy, but these are the important issues Ireland will have to address. At present, the PCW has yet to be ratified finally by the unions. The 'Work' side of any plan will be the real test for the government, because it is not yet clear whether unemployment - which has been levelling off in recent months - can be controlled. Certainly enough has been said about tackling it, but the heart of the problem remains intractable. The influential Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) published an upbeat mid-term outlook in April which gave rise to a headline in the Irish Times: 'The rising international tide could lift the Irish boat'. The ESRI, working with computer models, predicted an improving economy 'in the mid-term' - that is, into the next century. Consumer spending, for example, should rise by 3.5 per cent this year, and by up to 6.4 per cent in 1995. There has been some sign that the battered consumer, devastated by the rise in interest rates that preceded the 10 per cent devaluation of the punt in January 1993, has returned to the high street. Retail sales have been showing a slight improvement, and there was a big leap in new car sales in the first quarter, with a 46 per cent increase on the same period in 1993. However, this is partly due to a reduction in Vehicle Registration Tax announced in the Budget. But the ESRI report (by Sara Cantillon, John Curtis, and John FitzGerald, son of Garret FitzGerald, the former Taoiseach) warned that without a 'major policy change' long-term employment would remain a grave problem. A mixed blessing for the country came last November: the Republic's football team qualified for the World Cup by defeating Northern Ireland. People who might otherwise have bought a new car or even a house will now be spending any surplus - or borrowed - cash on a trip to the US, or on a new wider-screen television for the month of matches. The ESRI justifies its optimism, in part, by the way in which the Irish 'boat' has managed to stay afloat during recent stormy times, complimenting its 'robust performance in the face of international recession over the past couple of years'. Despite bad conditions last year, the economy managed about 2 per cent growth. Exports rose by about 8.75 per cent compared with growth in world trade of only 2.6 per cent. But ESRI sensibly qualifies its cheery view: 'The one uncertainty about the future is that the actual outturn will be more eventful than the smooth path we have plotted.' The effect of demographics will be watched with interest. Ireland's high birth rate has meant a crushing ratio of wage-earners to dependants; the highest in Europe. For every 10 people at work, there are between 20 and 30 dependants compared with three in, say, Denmark. 'The rate of increase in employment necessary to provide jobs for the young people entering the labour market in Ireland is 15 times greater than in the rest of Europe,' wrote Garret FitzGerald recently. But in the past five years the Irish birthrate has dropped dramatically, as members of the current generation tailor their families to their pockets and life styles rather than to the traditional Catholic model: 'as many as heaven sends.' The implications of this are many. For example, the ESRI forecast notes that the population change will have 'traumatic' effects for the teaching profession, where jobs are already a big issue, and for the health care sector, which will have to concentrate on an ageing population. Since 1972 employment in health and education services has risen from 90,000 to 140,000  -according to last month's meeting of the Irish Business and Employers Congress. These areas are now likely to shrink. Other job sources will have to be found. The running sore on the Irish economy for nearly a decade has been unemployment; Ireland has competed with Spain for the dubious title of having the highest unemployment in the EU. Last year the Republic suffered about 19 per cent unemployed compared to Spain's frightful 21 per cent, but since late last year the figures have been dropping - save for December. (Officials put that down to 'reverse emigration'.) The unemployment figure fell in March for the third successive month, with 290,600 people on the live register; 6,500 fewer than a year ago. The Central Statistical Office's figures for this time last year showed 1.146m people at work compared with 1.139m in 1992. Much of the rise in employment has been among female workers. Many women who previously stayed at home to look after their families are now being forced by circumstance, or liberated by changing attitudes, to seek work. Only 18 months ago you could read angry letters written to newspapers by graduates in Co Galway, complaining of the 'cheek' of married women in taking jobs. The statistics do show a stasis in the numbers of men at work, whereas female employment has risen by 55,000 since 1987. Many of these women are in the services sector - many, too, have lower pay than men, and inferior conditions. What is the government doing to create jobs? Tax breaks for small employers and drives to persuade overseas companies to set up in Ireland are two - perhaps too common - solutions. The Industrial Development Authority is campaigning to draw multinationals, and has had success with some telemarketing companies, creating hundreds of jobs. But the problem remains; when things go badly for the multinational, as for any creature on earth, it wants to go home.   Countries:-  IEZ  Ireland, EC.

As Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, used a speech at the Tory conference in Bournemouth to reassert the party's belief in the Union, ministers acknowledged that talks with Sinn Fein could be under way by Christmas. 'We don't want to drag our feet on this, we are not dawdling at all,' Sir Patrick said, holding out the prospect that loyalist representatives could also be brought into talks. London is considering a scaled-down response to the IRA ceasefire amid acknowledgement by senior ministers that it may never be given an unequivocal pledge that the end to violence is for good. The idea that the government should open a 'reversible' dialogue with Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, will be considered by Mr John Major, the prime minister, and cabinet colleagues next week. Sir Patrick said the loyalist ceasefire made it 'that much harder for the Provisionals to come back to violence and therefore it makes it a good deal easier for us to come to a working assumption'. The ceasefire gave a big push to the peace effort being carefully orchestrated by the UK and Irish governments. Mr Major said the announcement was 'unalloyed good news'. But he warned: 'We must analyse it and consider it and then carefully decide with realism what is the way forward.' Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, was less cautious, describing the development as 'a wonderful moment'. He urged everyone to 'now work together in a spirit of goodwill, reconciliation and forbearance to consolidate a just and lasting peace - to ensure that all of the people of Ireland are rid of the gun and the bomb from Irish politics for ever'. He pressed Mr Major to take the opportunity of his conference speech today to move the process forward. 'We are into the seventh week, and it is time the whole pace of consolidating the peace process was accelerated,' he said. In Bournemouth, Sir Patrick and Mr Major received a warm welcome from conference representatives, in spite of the leadership's decision not to allow a vote on whether the government should actively persuade Ulster's people that their best future lay in the UK. Yesterday's ceasefire move was announced at a press conference by the Combined Loyalist Military Command, representing the two main outlawed protestant paramilitary groups - the Ulster Defence Association and the Ulster Volunteer Force. The loyalists promised a cessation of 'all operational hostilities' from midnight last night. 'The permanence of our ceasefire will be completely dependent upon the continued cessation of all Nationalist and Republican violence,' the statement said. It also emerged that loyalist leaders had contact with the Irish government prior to the ceasefire announcement.

As the Irish evening light faded, topics would momentarily flare into life then, like rainbows, evaporate as sentences were left unfinished and mouths were delicately wiped. But then someone mentioned De Valera. A small, elderly gentleman, whose only contribution to the evening had been a hearty burp over the soup, sprang to life. 'De Valera was a cantankerous, humourless old bollocks,' he said, his pudgy little legs kicking the air. 'The worst thing to have happened to this miserable little country since Cromwell. That man (here he brandished his fish knife, sending a piece of turbot au beurre flying through the candlesticks) set Ireland back 200 years.' Things were not the same again. Tempers flared. Manners were forgotten as the civil war was replayed across the dinner table. Fresh drinks were petulantly called for. By the time coffee and liqueurs were served in the lounge - 'Make mine a large one: none of your Protestant meanness here,' shouted one guest to his landowning, but very Catholic, host - it was a verbal free for all. Dark personal secrets were revealed. A bottom or two was pinched. A large lady walking unsteadily to the lavatory almost garotted herself on a Victorian umbrella stand, collapsing in a heap of suspenders and stretched velvet. There is nothing the Irish like more than talking - particularly about themselves. It amounts to a national disease. Whole summer schools are devoted to the subject - hour after hour, year after year. The conclusions are inconclusive. The Irish are charming, difficult, spontaneous, unreliable, creative and knavish. They are Europeans, but not really. They are certainly nothing to do with the English - though it is grudgingly admitted that there are more of us over there than over here. In short, the Irish are unique - in their own sort of way. John Ardagh is charmed by the Irish. He has put together a highly readable account of the way Ireland is changing and how it is, a trifle self consciously, coming to terms with the modern world. Ardagh's energy cannot be doubted. He crisscrossed the country talking to scores of people from various shades of society. His list of thanks and acknowledgements reads like a Who's Who of modern Ireland. But somehow Ardagh is too kind. He makes the Englishman's mistake of believing too much of what the Irish tell him. Ardagh finds a great wealth of talent in Ireland. That is true. But Ardagh is too fond of littering his text with gushing adjectives. At least one person is described as astonishing, others are marvellous. Several people or their books and newspaper columns are brilliant. Ardagh admits to being pleasantly surprised by Northern Ireland. Its people, he finds, generally have more about them than the more easy going southerners. But again he cannot resist a bit of hyperbole. 'The people are marvellous, second to none.' Mary Robinson, the president, is one of the brilliant ones. 'A creaking political system - but a fine new woman President' is the irritating sub heading in one chapter. President Robinson is doubtless one of the best things to have happened to modern Ireland. But as Ardagh points out, she might have influence but she has no power in a country where political talent - in contrast to the cultural or academic spheres - is very thin on the ground. As is hinted at, Ireland has been a badly run country. The sleeve note on his book describes Ardagh as 'a strong believer in the battered old idea of European union.' There is no doubt that EU membership has brought great advantages to Ireland. It has widened cultural horizons, raised incomes, particularly of the farmers, and done away with some of the old dependence on Britain. But EU membership has introduced a new kind of dependence. Irish politicians gleefully talk about 'the take' from Brussels. EU membership has only delayed the painful adjustment of Irish agriculture to the modern market economy. In spite of the Irish diaspora spread round the world, Ireland itself remains an insular society, hardly part of the European mainstream. Ardagh does explode many of the old myths about Ireland by focusing on society as it is and not, as tourism promoters would have it, as some kitsch theme park full of Yeats and leprechauns. In the midst of all the interviews it is a pity that Ardagh does not pause for a bit more fun. When he does it illuminates what at times is a somewhat repetitive journal. Ardagh describes meeting Garech Browne, part of the Guinness clan and an eccentric even by Irish standards. 'Garech is married to an Indian princess who is sometimes around. He was asleep when I arrived as agreed at 7pm, but eventually he woke up and remembered who I was . . .' Garech is founder of one of Ireland's most successful recording companies but had no record player in the house. Ardagh relates how Garech takes him out to sit in his old Mercedes where, 'shivering under the starry March night, we listened to cassettes of glorious Irish folk music on its radio. I went home very happy.'   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P2731 Book Publishing.   Types:-  TECH  Products  Product use.  The Financial Times   London Page XX  "
0,FT932-7926 ,"FT932-7926 _AN-DEUB0ABYFT 930521   FT  21 MAY 93 / IRA blast injures 20 people in Belfast      By TIM COONE and RALPH ATKINS      DUBLIN, LONDON   A 1,000lb IRA bomb exploded in the centre of Belfast yesterday, injuring 20 people and badly damaging the headquarters of the Ulster Unionist party, as counting started for Northern Ireland's local elections. The explosion came as early returns from the polls, held on Wednesday, suggested that the hardline parties on both sides of the sectarian divide had performed strongly, an outcome which would damage the prospects of renewed inter-party talks on the province's future. The bomb, similar in size to the one which killed three people and badly damaged the Baltic Exchange in London last year, was placed in a skip lorry in a side street between the Europa Hotel and the Grand Opera House, yards from the UUP headquarters. It was near the spot where another powerful IRA bomb was detonated in December 1991. The device went off during the morning rush-hour, as the Army attempted to disarm it by two controlled explosions. It badly damaged the Europa Hotel and surrounding offices and shops, blowing out windows over a wide area. None of the injured was seriously hurt. The IRA claimed responsibility for the blast. The Belfast Opera House - repaired at a cost of Pounds 1m after being hit by the IRA bomb of late 1991 - took the full force of the explosion. A huge hole was blasted in the side of the 98-year-old building. The bombers evaded an intensive security cordon which has been thrown around the city centre during the week leading up to the elections, in which 582 councillors are to be elected to 26 district councils in the province. Mr Jim Wilson, general secretary of the UUP, said: 'I would suggest the IRA have identified their real enemy, the Ulster Unionist people of the province. They obviously know they didn't write us off at the ballot box and they won't do it with a bomb either.' Dr Joe Hendron, Social Democratic and Labour party MP for the nationalist area of west Belfast, said: 'I look on the people who did this as gangsters. It is a dastardly act and I condemn all those associated with planning it and executing it.' The final results of the elections are not expected until this afternoon, as the proportional representation system used in the province entails numerous counts of transferable votes. Early returns suggest that the UUP vote has slipped from 31 per cent to 30 per cent, while the vote for the hardline Democratic Unionist party, and for Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, has strengthened in the urban centres of Belfast and Derry. If this trend is confirmed in the final result it will prove a bitter disappointment to Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland Secretary. He hoped that a strengthened vote for the UUP and the SDLP, the more moderate parties on either side of the sectarian divide, would facilitate his efforts to renew the inter-party talks on the province's political future, which were abandoned without agreement last November. At Westminster yesterday Sir Patrick told MPs that proposals the government was drawing up for the province's future would 'give some direction and focus' to any renewed talks. But he said that the government had no plans to publish its suggestions  - expected to set a framework for devolved government in the province. The government wants to keep details of negotiations confidential, he said. Sir Patrick is due to meet the leaders of Northern Ireland's main political parties, once the local elections are com-pleted. Two Anglo-Irish conference meetings are expected before any round-table talks start, however, suggesting a resumption of negotiations is at least another month away. There also seems to be only lukewarm support among local political leaders for such talks.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P9721 International Affairs.

The package includes grant of adult franchise given for  the first time to the people of the Northern Areas, party-based  elections, and reservation of two seats for women in the elected  council. The federal minister for information and broadcasting,  Mr. Khalid Ahmad Kharal, said the chief executive of the  Northern Areas will have the status of a federal minister. The  Northern Areas will be granted fiscal autonomy. The existing  post of judicial commissioner would also be abolished, and in  its place the chief court would be set up which will be headed  by a retired judge of a provincial high court. He also said the  post of chief commissioner will be replaced by chief secretary  assisted by four secretaries. The minister announced October as  the month of general elections to the enlarged Northern Areas  Council. The people of the area, including leading politicians,  lawyers, intellectuals, and laymen, have hailed this historic  decision of the government. The Northern Areas with an area of  over 29,000 square miles and a population of nearly 7 lakh have  six districts; namely, Gilgit, Skardu, Baltistan, (Jia Mer),  (Khujar), and (Laochi).    The region is enormously important to Pakistan for a number  of reasons. First of all, its picturesque beauty, snow-covered  mountains, fabulous lakes, crystal glaciers, orchards and  gardens, minerals and fruits fascinate tourists from all over  the world. The government of Pakistan earns over 70 million  rupees annually from the tourism industry of the region.  Besides, the legendary Karakoram Highway, which is a towering  emblem of unbreakable Sino-Pak friendship, links Pakistan with  the Central Asian Republics, which are integral part of Economic  Cooperation Organization.    The region is also significant from the strategic point of  view, as Siachen Glacier -- the highest battlefield in the world  -- is also situated in the Northern Areas. The people of these  areas won their freedom through armed struggle against Dogra  rulers soon after the creation of Pakistan. However, their  grievances and heritage from the Dogra colonial era were not  redressed. The late Mr. Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto started taking  steps in the right direction. He constituted a land commission  for them, created Ministry for Northern Areas, allocated service  and education quota for them, started development programs, set  up dispensaries and health units, and encouraged NGO's  [nongovernment organizations] like Agha Khan Trust and Gilgit  Society. He abolished the notorious Frontier Crimes Regulation.    The caretaker prime minister, Moin Qureshi, during his three  months' rule, took a few vital decisions. It would not be  inaccurate to say that Moin Qureshi's proposals for reforms in  the Northern Areas provided impetus to the incumbent prime  minister, Ms. Benazir Bhutto, who has left no stone unturned to  offer all types of incentives to the people of the region. The  prime minister in the fall of 1993 announced 70 development  schemes for Northern Areas. They included housing,  communication, transportation, education, health, employment,  and women emancipation. She has reaffirmed that Northern Areas  would be among the leading beneficiaries of the social action  programs. She has also emphasized the establishment of an  industrial zone in the Northern Areas and investors would be  offered wide-ranging incentives. The prime minister has also  asked the OGDC [Oil and Gas Development Corporation] experts to  prepare feasibility report for providing fuel facilities to the  region, specially natural gas. The prime minister is determined  to bring the Northern Areas and other neglected parts of the  country at par with the other areas. She is well aware of the  fact that democracy means uniformity of privileges and that  socioeconomic and political discrepancies damage the entire  structure of a state. This is one of the interpretations of her  future vision of Pakistan.     "

The prime minister told MPs that a joint authority to handle relations between Ulster and Dublin had been rejected by the British and Irish governments. Speaking on the eve of the first visit to parliament for more than a decade by Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, Mr Major said the government would begin talks next month with both the IRA's political wing and loyalist representatives - 'so long as the ceasefire is maintained'. It is understood that the talks with Sinn Fein will probably begin first. Sinn Fein last night said it regretted the failure of the parties in the Irish republic's coalition government to agree to stay in office together so that they could continue with their joint programme, particularly in the 'vital area' of the Ulster peace process. But at Westminster the Rev Martin Smyth, Ulster Unionist MP for Belfast South, said: 'I would have thought it would have no significant effect on the peace process because all the politicians in Dublin are signed up to it.' The prime minister assured MPs that Northern Ireland remained at the top of the government's priorities, but said there was still 'a long way to go' before peace in the province was secure. He said good progress had been made in discussions with the Irish government on the joint framework document that will form the basis of talks involving Ulster's main political parties. The document would contain proposals for a locally elected Ulster assembly and suggest a framework for cross-border structures to handle north-south relations. But he emphasised that the framework document would not be 'a straitjacket'. It was not a 'London-Dublin deal' that would be imposed. Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader, expressed 'cautious optimism' on the province's future and promised that Labour would continue to support the peace process. Leading unionists made clear they would not be sorry to see the Irish political crisis lead to the departure of Mr Albert Reynolds as the republic's prime minister. Mr David Trimble, the Ulster Unionist party's legal spokesman, said: 'In a sense almost anyone would be better than Albert Reynolds. 'As we see it Mr Reynolds . . . has been trying to get quick results. He has been trying to force the pace of peace negotiations and creating an air of crisis.' He rejected the idea that Fine Gael, the main opposition party in Dublin, is more pro-unionist than Mr Reynolds' Fianna Fail. Mr Ian Paisley Jnr, of the hardline Democratic Unionist party, said the peace process would continue whatever government was in power in Dublin. Mr David Ervine of the Progressive Unionist party, which speaks for some loyalist paramilitaries, also said a change of government in the republic would not damage the peace process.

0,FT934-5717 ,"FT934-5717 _AN-DK2DYAA5FT 931129   FT  29 NOV 93 / Abortive initiatives go back more than 20 years      By RICHARD DONKIN   The history of the IRA's campaign against the British government is littered with abandoned initiatives and meetings between serving politicians and republican leaders. Discussions since the early 1970s have been veiled in secrecy because of the sensitivity of both the unionists and successive Irish governments. Lord Wilson, when leader of the Labour opposition, met IRA leaders in Dublin in 1971 and again the next year in England. The first meeting was described as an 'act of treachery' by Dr Garret FitzGerald, the then Irish president, and a 'waffling session' by Mr Joe Cahill, one of the IRA leaders present. The most direct formal talks between a government and republicans came in June 1972 when Lord Whitelaw, as secretary of state for Northern Ireland, held secret and abortive talks to try to arrange a ceasefire with a group of six republican leaders in London. The republicans, including Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president who had been interned in Long Kesh, and Mr Martin McGuinness, his deputy, were flown out of Belfast by the RAF and escorted in great secrecy to the Chelsea house of Mr Paul Channon, Whitelaw's junior minister. The IRA team, led by Mr Sean MacStiofain, the then Provisionals' chief-of-staff, demanded the right to national self-determination for the Irish people as a whole, a declaration by the government to withdraw troops within 2 1/2 years and an amnesty for political prisoners. Lord Whitelaw declared afterwards in his memoirs that the meeting was a 'non-event'. He wrote: 'The IRA leaders simply made impossible demands which I told them the British government would never concede. They were in fact still in a mood of defiance and determination to carry on until their absurd ultimatums were met.' Mr McGuinness admitted that his team had concluded they had not reached a position at that time where they could do 'serious business' with the British government. During 1974 and 1975, under the then Labour government, senior officials regularly met Sinn Fein leaders at Laneside, a large government-owned house to the east of Belfast. These meetings, authorised by Mr Merlyn Rees, then Northern Ireland secretary, helped establish local channels of communication with the IRA in Belfast, used to discuss arrangements for the ceasefire of 1975. Other, less formal contacts, have been established from time to time. Mr Douglas Hurd, now foreign secretary, was a frontbench spokesman on European affairs when he met Mr Adams and Mr Danny Morrison of Sinn Fein in Belfast in 1978. Mr Hurd stressed that he was acting as an individual. Informal and formal meetings alike have generally caused unease in the Irish republic. Dr Garret FitzGerald, the former Irish prime minister, said in his memoirs: 'The contacts that had taken place had had the effect merely of prolonging violence by deluding the IRA into believing that a British government would eventually negotiate a settlement with them.'

Mr Reynolds said he had provided ""copious  clarification"" of the document he signed along with John Major  in London on December 15. He told a European Parliament  candidates selection meeting of his Fianna Fail party in Dublin  that he had given clarification of the declaration in numerous  statements as well as in a lengthy response last week to a  letter from Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams.    ""Since such clarification was requested from us we are  entitled to expect that it would be carefully studied and taken  into account,"" he said.    ""Two months after the joint peace declaration it is time for  political realism and for a clear decision soon ..."" he added.  [passage omitted]    Mr Reynolds warned against thinking that clarification from  London for the Republicans was all that was needed and said the  role of the Irish Government was central to the peace process.  He said it was clear the armed conflict could resolve nothing  and equally clear that bilateral dialogue or negotiation between  Sinn Fein and Britain, without regard to Dublin or the other  Northern Ireland political parties, would also fail to solve the  impasse.    ""I have provided comprehensive textual clarification,"" he  added. ""I have presented a closely argued analysis of how  self-determination is applied in international law in  partitioned countries worldwide. I would expect people to study  it and respond to it and not to treat the issue simplistically,""  he urged.     "

Several speakers in the defence debate called for Britain to abandon the Trident nuclear-missile programme as a first step to a worldwide ban on nuclear weapons. There were also calls for an end to arms exports, and for defence spending to be reduced progressively following the end of the cold war. But calls for unilateral disarmament no longer sway the conference in the way they did in the mid-1980s. The party endorsed each of the proposals to maintain defence spending put forward by Mr Campbell, including the reshaping of defence policy to meet possible new threats. He said Britain should resist any demands for 'another raid' on the defence budget even if recent attempts to forge peace in Northern Ireland led to a reduction in troops there. He also demanded that the government maintain its military presence in Bosnia, vetoing any attempt by the UN to lift the arms embargo in the former Yugoslavia. Mr Campbell said lifting the embargo on the Bosnian Moslems and other factions would destroy the efforts of UK peace-keeping troops in the region. 'If it is lifted, the position of UN forces, particularly our own, will become intolerable. Their withdrawal will be perilous in the extreme,' he said. Ms Liz Mayer, a delegate from Islington, north London, said Britain had to reduce defence spending if it was to regenerate its industrial base. 'We cannot afford not to adopt such policies,' she said.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P9711 National Security.     P8651 Political Organizations.

0,FT944-5677 ,"FT944-5677 _AN-ELBDWAC1FT 941202   FT  02 DEC 94 / Management: TNT time for quality - A look at an award which aims to create TQM role models      By TIM DICKSON   Large lorries trundled down the ramp at Wapping, Rupert Murdoch's east London printing site and cradle of a Fleet Street revolution nine years ago. Cameras whirred, pickets shouted night after night. For many people in Britain the image of TNT Express (UK) - the Australian-owned group which operated those vehicles - is still defined by those events. This week, however, the logistics and supply-chain management company earned a new and less controversial reputation as a paragon of British quality. Along with Rover Group, TNT was announced joint winner on Wednesday night of the UK's first Quality Award, launched earlier this year to recognise outstanding business performance through the application of Total Quality Management principles. Avis Rent A Car, BT Northern Ireland and ICL's Customer Service division were also shortlisted. The prize's objective is identical to the European Quality Awards and the US Baldridge Awards which have both sought in recent years to create TQM role models. The UK competition, and the more than 800 business people who packed a central London hotel for the award ceremony, bear witness to the continuing appeal of TQM more than 40 years after its 'invention' by two American lecturers working in Japan. TQM may be less fashionable than business process re-engineering but it is still widely considered to have high potential to transform organisations by putting the spotlight on customer and employee satisfaction. Over the next few months TNT chief executive Alan Jones and John Towers, his opposite number at Rover, will find themselves at Quality conferences and seminars up and down the country explaining why their programmes have produced results, thus inspiring others who have been less successful. TNT, which delivers 60 per cent of Britain's national newspaper tonnage from a standing start in 1985, began its Total Quality initiative in 1989. 'Our whole philosophy is that we want to help our customers sell more of their products: in doing that so we sell more of our freight,' explains Jones. He cites as an example TNT's suggestion that newspapers discontinue the age-old practice of individually labelling each newsagent's package - a change which helped cut transit times by one hour. Rover believes it has demonstrated the value of TQ in the way it has bucked the recession in the European motor industry. Product quality improvements, for instance, have substantially reduced warranty costs while external surveys have tracked an improving trend in customer satisfaction. Towers says TQM is 'not like a package of pills you pull off the shelf, and take with a glass of water three times a week'. He cites the importance of top-level leadership, the establishment of a vision which individuals can identify with across the company, and the creation of what he calls a 'compelling need'. He suggests British companies are good at 'pulling themselves back from the brink' but less inspired when times are good. Rover's answer in 1990 was to paint a picture of what the car industry might look like by 1995 - based on research of events in North America: 'It was not so much a Sword of Damocles as simply saying to people this is what is likely to change, you might as well get on and make sure that's what we do rather than take the risk that we are overpowered by rivals'. Towers talks about 'getting the drum going' but not changing the beat. Changing the metaphor, he adds: 'One of the things about the Japanese is that they don't have to have a new flag every year, even if its colour may alter a bit'.   Companies:-  TNT Express (UK).

Mr Tom Hartley, Sinn Fein's national chairman, is today expected to use a London press conference to repeat calls for the British government to open direct talks with republican leaders aimed at providing 'clarification' of the Downing Street peace declaration. But there was still no sign last night that the IRA's gesture had succeeded in exposing differences between the British and Irish governments. London and Dublin have consistently criticised the ceasefire as inadequate and made clear their frustration at the IRA's refusal to declare a permanent end to violence. As Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, departed yesterday on an 11-day visit to North America, Downing Street rebuffed a call from Mr John Hume, leader of the mainly Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party, for a representative to be sent to meet republican leaders. Downing Street rejected Mr Hume's suggestion for a senior Tory backbencher to be appointed as go-between. It said: 'The situation remains the same. We are not going to get involved in anything like this.' The rejection came as Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, sought to increase pressure on the government by making it clear that Mr Hume's idea for an intermediary would meet its demand for direct talks. Sir Patrick said he would use his trip to welcome the strong support shown for the Downing Street declaration in both Canada and the United States and to reaffirm the government's determination to eliminate terrorism.

In comments made less than 48 hours before a decision on the  ban is due, Downing Street officials said they hoped a visa  would not be given to Mr Adams unless he made ""a clear and  unequivocal renunciation of violence."" It was ""deeds not words""  that were required, the officials emphasised. They said the  government had been ""in discussion"" with the U.S. on the subject.    The signal came as the IRA left fire bombs at three stores  in  Oxford Street, London's busiest shopping street, in what was  believed to be the first mainland terrorist action of the year.    Yesterday also saw Northern Ireland's first sectarian  murders  of 1994 when a Roman Catholic man was shot dead as he slept in  Belfast. A second man was killed at Ballymena and a third was  shot dead in Donaghadee, County Down.    The attacks came on the eve of the first session of the  Anglo-Irish inter-governmental conference since the two  governments unveiled their joint peace initiative in December.    The conference is likely to provide the opportunity for both  governments to reaffirm their joint position on the peace  initiative.    A display of unity over the progress of the political talks  coordinated by Mr Michael Ancram, the Northern Ireland minister,  may be harder to engineer. London has indicated that it intends  to act, as promised, to give focus to the talks fairly soon,  although this may come in bilateral and private sessions.  Dublin is anxious not to divert attention from the peace  process.    Mr Adams recently applied for a visa at the American Embassy  in Dublin after receiving an invitation to attend a conference  in New York on Monday [31 January].    Under U.S. immigration law, he is still officially  ineligible  for a visa but a waiver can be issued by the attorney general on  recommendation from Mr Warren Christopher, the secretary of  state.    It is understood that President Bill Clinton has been  involved in the decision-making process and that a series of  meetings took place in Washington on Wednesday. A number of  Irish-American politicians have lobbied on Mr Adams' behalf.    The leaders of the Ulster Unionists and the hardline  Democratic Unionist party [DUP] have already declined an  invitation to attend the conference.    The Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the DUP, yesterday told the  organisers that he would not attend a meeting ""designed to give  credibility and legitimacy to the apologist for IRA murder."" Mr  John Hume, leader of the mainly Catholic Social Democratic and  Labour party, and Dr John Alderdice, leader of the Alliance  party, are expected to attend.     "

He sent a letter to Mr John Major setting out his agenda for talks between the British government and Sinn Fein, David Owen and John Murray Brown write. He said he had written to the prime minister to ensure there was 'no confusion or time lost over arranging such matters as delegations, venues and times'. He added: 'All of these issues can and should be sorted out now.' Downing Street yesterday confirmed that Mr Major had received the letter but officials were not sure whether he had had time to study it. They said the government would move ahead with talks 'at the pace it determined to be correct'. Ministers have said a preliminary dialogue with Sinn Fein would begin before Christmas if the IRA ceasefire, now nearly three months old, held. Talks with loyalist political representatives would start soon afterwards. Mr Adams told Downing Street that the Sinn Fein team in the talks would be led by Mr Martin McGuinness, a vice-president. He said that the ground to be covered should include 'demilitarisation and other issues'. A week ago Mr Adams accused the government of dragging its feet on efforts to forge a lasting settlement in the province. Yesterday Mr Pat Doherty, another Sinn Fein vice-president, speaking at Dublin's Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, called on both London and Dublin to convene all-party talks to find a settlement.

In anticipation of  this, British officials have sought to justify the response as  ""commentary"" rather than ""clarification -- a semantic  distinction which may be less than obvious to the anxious  Unionist community. The more important point is that Ulster  seems not an inch closer to peace as a result of this sterile  correspondence.    The stern language of the statement -- which warned Sinn  Fein  to stop ""playing for time"" and to realise that ""there is no  conceivable justification for continuing to rob people of their  lives"" -- masks its tactical significance. On balance, the  contacts between John Major and Gerry Adams, president of the  IRA's political wing, were probably ill-advised.    Sinn Fein's strategy since the Prime Minister and Albert  Reynolds, the Irish Prime Minister, signed the declaration in  December has been to cultivate a specious legitimacy without  fulfilling the preconditions for exploratory talks. Mr Adams  has encouraged the view that his movement is ready to lay down  its weapons and join the political process. Trips abroad, the  stagemanaged Sinn Fein conference in February and the three-day  Easter truce have all played a part in this relentless public  relations campaign.    Meanwhile, the IRA has shelled Heathrow airport, a British  helicopter has been shot from the skies in Armagh, and troops,  policemen and civilians have continued to be targeted  ruthlessly. The Government may claim that yesterday s response  has laid the troublesome ghost of ""clarification"" to rest once  and for all. Sinn Feins interpretation will surely be just the  opposite: that the preconditions required by the declaration are  not absolute and that negotiation by stealth remains an option.    Regrettably, Mr Major's faith in the five-month-old peace  process has not been vindicated. While ministers agonised over  Sinn Feins demand this week, blood was flowing in the province  as if the declaration had never been signed. A teenager died in  Armagh yesterday from injuries suffered in a Loyalist sectarian  attack on Wednesday; earlier this week, two Catholic building  workers were shot dead by the Ulster Volunteer Force. The  determination of the men of violence to continue their work  could not be clearer. Against this background, the tired  reiteration of the declarations principles seems increasingly  irrelevant.    The fact of yesterday's response is more illuminating than  its detail. It confirms that the Prime Minister has yet to  accept the need for a new strategy in Ulster. On security  matters, he should begin by considering the intelligent  amendments to the Criminal Justice Bill proposed by David  Trimble, the Unionist MP for Upper Bann. In the constitutional  field, he should press ahead with the stalled plans for an  administrative assembly in the province. Wooing Sinn Fein has  done nothing but raise the party's profile and alarm the  Protestant community in Ulster. If his wish to be remembered as  a peacebroker in Ireland is sincere, Mr Major will have to think  again.     "

Mr Martin McGuinness, a member of the ruling executive of the IRA's political wing, said the government's decision to respond to republican calls for clarification of the UK-Irish document represented 'a small step in the slowly evolving peace process'. Sinn Fein was determined to play a full and positive role in an effective peace process, which must 'embrace everyone and exclude no one'. Mr McGuinness's remarks came less than 24 hours after London stepped up pressure on the IRA to halt its 25-year campaign of violence by publishing a detailed commentary on Sinn Fein's 20 questions, answering one of them directly. The painstaking nature of the government's reply was welcomed by unionists and nationalists alike. Mr McGuinness hinted that Sinn Fein was unlikely to decide how to respond to the government's comments until after next month's European elections, saying its policy of undertaking broad consultations at all levels of its membership would cause a delay. Meanwhile, pressure on unionist paramilitaries to end their violence has intensified. Mr James Molyneaux, leader of the Ulster Unionist party, said yesterday that the Downing Street declaration had made clear there was no distinction between republican or loyalist paramilitary oganisations engaging in exploratory talks once the violence ended. Mr Ruairi Quinn, a senior Irish cabinet minister, said Sinn Fein's initial comments on the British response were encouraging. There were 'clearly tensions within the Sinn Fein-IRA movement'. One could only hope they would be resolved 'in the interests of peace'.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.     IEZ  Ireland, EC.   Industries:-  P9721 International Affairs.

Two other human rights  reports published this week call for an independent public  inquiry into alleged collusion between security forces and  loyalist paramilitaries.    President Clinton will be briefed on the State Department  report before he meets the Prime Minister in Washington on  February 27. Its contents, should they be raised at the meeting,  will further sour the ""special relationship"" between the two  countries, strained by Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams's visit  to New York last week.    The report gives details of recent killings and judicial  proceedings. ""Although no deaths resulted from shootings by  security forces (in 1993), charges continued that soldiers  resorted to lethal force precipitately and carried out a `shoot  to kill' policy,"" it says.    ""Security forces, both the army and Royal Ulster  Constabulary  [RUC], frequently harass citizens verbally, particularly young  people in areas where community support for terrorists is  considered strong. Security forces have also been accused of  more serious incidents of physical mistreatment.""    In Political Killings in Northern Ireland, published today,  Amnesty International accuses the Government of evading its duty  to investigate ""mounting evidence of collusion between  government forces and groups like the banned Ulster Defence  Association [UDA] that oppose any change in Northern lreland's  status quo.... The Government must make every effort to show  equal concern for all members of the population, by guaranteeing  equal protection.""    And the Belfast-based Committee on the Administration of  Justice has this week published a report on allegations of  harassment in connection with incidents involving the use of  lethal force. Of 20 families interviewed by the Committee, nine  reported that their deceased family member had received death  threats by police or soldiers.    All three reports note the killing of some 350 people by the  security forces since 1969. Most were Catholics, about half of  whom were unarmed. Up to 1991, 21 security force members were  prosecuted for killings using firearms. Nineteen were found not  guilty, one was convicted of manslaughter and given a suspended  sentence. Only one, a soldier, was convicted of murder.  Although given a life sentence, he served just over two years  and was then reinstated in the army.    Amnesty says: ""The pattern that has emerged is one of  repeated allegtions that suspects are arbitrarily killed rather  than being arrested, that members of the security forces believe  they can operate with impunity, and that this is reinforced by  government failure to take steps to prevent unlawful killings.    ""The Government evades responsibility by hiding behind an  array of legal procedures and secret inquiries.""    It calls for an independent inquiry into the murder of  Patrick Finucane, a lawyer shot dead in February 1989 by the  outlawed Ulster Freedom Fighters, and the role played by Brian  Nelson, a UDA member and army informer sentenced to 10 years'  imprisonment last year for conspiracy to murder.    It also calls for the widening of the Stevens inquiry, which  in 1989 investigated security leaks to loyalist groups and which  was reopened last year after Mr Nelson's trial. ""The apparent  failure of the security forces to take significant action  against UDA `death squads' was not addressed before the court,""  Amnesty says.    The report considers allegations that the RUC has been  negligent in gathering evidence about loyalist attacks on  catholics, that it has failed to respond adequately to demands  for protection and has failed to deter loyalist paramilitaries  from entering catholic areas or to detect them despite  surveillance.    ""The facility with which loyalist gunmen raid homes in  stringently monitored and controlled Catholic neighbourhoods and  then leave witout hindrance has contributed to the lack of  confidence in the RUC,"" Amnesty says.

This  has been a topic of discussion among the British people  recently. Although the Britain of today cannot be compared with  that of the past, the Major government is still doing its utmost  to continue pursuing ""three-circle diplomacy,"" that is,  conducting activities within the three links of developing the  Western European Union, maintaining the special relationship  between Britain and the United States, and preserving the  British Commonwealth, as proposed by Winston Churchill and first  put into practice by Foreign Secretary Earnest Belvin. If we  say that Churchill's pursuit of ""three-circle diplomacy"" was  effected through a series of measures, we can also see that the  times and situations have changed, and the Major government  seems unable to pursue ""three-circle diplomacy"" as it wishes and  finds it difficult to go any further.    In developing its relationship with Europe, Britain seems to  be hesitating and marking time. Although Prime Minister Major  repeatedly claimed to place Britain in the ""heart of Europe,"" it  has always been regarded by the European Union as a half-hearted  member. Since the end of World War II, Britain has taken a  position toward European union which is different from most  countries on the European Continent. With regard to the goals  and orientation of building Europe, the mainstream faction of  most governments of the EC members -- including France, Germany,  and so on -- represented by Jean Monnet and Delors, has taken  the building of an integrated European economic and political  entity or a supranational European union as a basic goal, since  the early years of European unification movement until the  subsequent effort to build an integrated European community.  Britain did not favor this proposition, however, and still has  reservations on the goal of developing the EC into a union as  proposed by the Maastricht Treaty. With regard to the presence  of the United States in Europe, it maintains that the United  States should remain in Europe to balance the strength there,  but France and Germany hold that ""Europe belongs to the  Europeans."" The United States supported the suggestion that  Germany be admitted as an additional permanent member of the UN  Security Council early last year, but Britain and France have  reservations on this issue. With regard to the war flames that  are spreading in the former Yugoslav regions, Britain, France,  and Germany all have considerations of their own.    The ""special relationship between Britain and the United  States,"" which has been maintained for many years, is not so  ""special"" now. Before the gunsmoke of World War II had lifted,  former British Prime Minister Churchill proposed establishing a  ""special British-U.S. relationship"" in his speech in Fulton in  the United States, hoping to use the United States to prop up  its appearance of ""might."" During the Cold War period, the  actions of the Western alliance were generally determined by  unanimous agreement between the two countries. However, the two  special allies have harbored ill feelings toward one another for  some time recently. Prior to Christmas in 1992, President-elect  Clinton made an excuse to avoid meeting the British prime  minister who was visiting the United States at that time, which  cast a dark shadow over British-U.S. relations. In February of  the next year when Major once again visited the United States,  he failed to repair the ""special relationship,"" and differences  between the two sides became even more prominent--they stuck to  their own arguments on the issue of trade talks between Europe  and the United States, had acute differences in their views on  airdropping materials in Bosnia- Herzegovina, and engaged in a  battle of words on the issue of Northern Ireland. The United  States denounced British actions in Northern Ireland as  ""violations of human rights,"" and Britain criticized the U.S.  intention to send a peace corps to inspect North Ireland as  ""interference in its internal affairs."" It appears that  people's views on the ""special relationship"" have changed under  the situation of increasing friction and conflicts between the  two sides economically and politically, although both consider  it necessary to maintain such a ""special relationship.""    Britain has made a comprehensive effort to maintain the  increasingly weak British Commonwealth. With each member of the  Commonwealth currently going its own way, however, the decisions  made by the conference are not binding on the member countries.  When the conference of the British Commonwealth was held in  Cyprus last year, the newspapers in the host country stated that  the ""themes of the conference are irrelevant and pointless,"" and  that the British Commonwealth was ""no longer a major force in  international politics."" In Australia, an irresistible wave of  republican sentiment is surging forward, and Australian Prime  Minister Keating has repeatedly proposed that Australia should  appear in the international arena as an ""image of independence,""  should become a republic before the year 2000, and should change  its national flag, which is similar in design to the British  ensign, in due time.    There are profound root causes for the challenges that the  British ""three-circle diplomacy"" is facing.    Britain was once very glorious, but this glory has become  history. Economic statistics show that British industry has  been in an accelerated decline, and its proportion in  international manufacturing production, trade, and GNP have  fallen sharply. Over the past few years, the country has been  bogged down in a serious economic recession and so far has  lacked the strength to recover. Just as the British magazine the  ECONOMIST has stated, ""Britain's real significance has been on  the wane to a considerable extent."" Economic reality has made  people realize that ""its position of strength of the past is  gone forever.""    The radical changes in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe,  the reunification of Germany, and the conclusion of the Cold War  have fundamentally changed the international environment which  Britain has relied upon to maneuver and carry out its foreign  policies. First, the end of the Cold War noticeably weakened the  British position and influence. Being a victorious nation in  World War II and the second largest economic power in the  capitalist world in early post-war years, and backed up by the  ""special British-U.S. relationship,"" Britain played an important  role in the formation and development of the international  political and economic order after World War II. With the lapse  of the Cold War era, however, the importance of the military  factor in the relations of the Western alliance have declined,  while that of economic factors has risen remarkably. Thus, its  political superiority -- based on its military capability and  its role in the defense of the West -- has been deteriorating  imperceptibly. Moreover, united Germany has grown to be the  number one economic power in Europe and occupies an increasingly  important position of leadership in the EC with every passing  day. As a result, in foreign affairs the United States is  leaning more toward Germany as the days go by. Second, U.S.  foreign policy specialists maintain that the ""future of the  world lies in Asia."" Asia's position in the U.S. global  strategy has risen somewhat, and the relationship between the  United States and the Western European countries, including  Britain, is facing new readjustments.    Although Britain's national strength is far from what it was  in the past, the British Government has not redefined its  position and policy goals according to the new international  pattern. Conversely, it has continued to pursue Churchill's  ""three-circle diplomacy."" This is a tough problem for British  diplomacy. Therefore, the British press maintains that Britain's  foreign policy goals are in urgent need of further  readjustment."" A senior British Government official also said a  short time ago that Britain will lose its international  influence -- which it still possesses -- unless it reevaluates  its foreign policy goals and refrains from sticking its nose in  everybody's business.
