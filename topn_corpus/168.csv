Mandela's wife. Mandela's child. Mandela's niece. Thriving in  his glory was the simplest cocoon to shield in from the glaring public, or to  boost your extinct ego. I vowed that none of this would apply to me.    Winnie Mandela, in ""Higher Than Hope""    On a summer's day in 1958, a dashing black lawyer named Nelson Mandela pulled  his car over to the roadside and proposed marriage to the shy, doe-eyed  23-year-old at his side.    Winnie Madikizela should have been worried that her husband-to-be was on trial  for treason. That he was 16 years her senior. And that his sophisticated  friends regarded her as a flighty damsel too beautiful to be a revolutionary's  wife.    Years later, writing to Winnie from prison, Nelson Mandela admitted that he  agonized over having ""abandoned this young and inexperienced woman in a  pitiless desert, literally throwing her into the hands of highwaymen.""      Stronger Than Believed    Winnie Mandela turned out to be made of stronger fiber than anyone guessed.    She raised two daughters and supported her husband's cause throughout  relentless police raids, detentions, trials, interrogations, banning orders and  banishment. And in time even her husband's colleagues replaced their disdain  for her with respect.    Today, however, she and her young bodyguards have been linked to the killing of  a teen-aged black activist and the abduction and beating of three others. She  has been ostracized by anti-apartheid leaders and publicly criticized by her  husband's exiled movement, the African National Congress.    Some figure that Winnie Mandela was numbed by adoring sycophants and consumed  by her own towering ego. Others say she was deceived by the hard-luck stories  of wayward teen-agers and too naive to believe that they were using the Mandela  name to terrorize other blacks.      Part Flint, Part Flower    The truth is somewhere in between. Winnie Mandela is and always has been part  flint and part flower -- combative, stubborn, willful and quick to anger, but  also trusting, generous and charming, according to her closest friends and  neighbors in Soweto as well as political analysts and senior figures in the  anti-apartheid movement.    But her supporters and detractors agree on one thing: The same streak of  independence that earned her worldwide admiration also got her into trouble  here at home with her fellow activists, who have always tried to protect the  venerable name of Mandela.    ""That is Winnie; even in the early years, you would give advice to her and  she'd listen, but then she'd do her own thing,"" said Fatima Meer, a University  of Natal sociology professor and a friend of Winnie Mandela for 30 years.  ""That's how she survived the state's attacks on her -- by taking decisions on  her own.""    Even as a child, Nomzamo Winnifred Madikizela had a reputation for being  headstrong, and many sibling quarrels ended with a spanking for Winnie. Born 54  years ago, she was the fourth daughter in a family that desperately wanted a  son, and she was taller and stronger than other children her age.    After high school, Winnie went to Johannesburg to study, with the aim of going  into social work. Among the other girls she was often called ""Lady Tarzan""  because ""I solved problems the simple way, using physical force, as I had done  way back in my childhood, when I defended myself against older boys who came  marauding into our mealie (corn) fields at harvest time,"" she recalled in  ""Higher Than Hope,"" a 1988 biography of her husband.    She had just landed her first job in social work when she met Mandela. His  friends found her charming but too young and politically inexperienced for  someone of Mandela's stature in the black liberation movement.      Vivacious, Bright-Eyed    ""She was very vivacious, very bright-eyed,"" one of Mandela's friends remembered  recently. ""But we didn't take her seriously at all.""    Four years after the marriage, Mandela was convicted of sabotage and sent to  prison for life. Over the next 15 years, his wife spent 17 months in solitary  confinement, six years under banning orders that prevented her from talking  with more than three people at a time and four years under house arrest.    She grew more defiant and was frequently charged with violating her banning  orders. In an attempt to silence her, the authorities banished her in 1977 to a  three-room shack in the Orange Free State, the most conservative province in  the country.    It was there, 300 miles from the fires of political activity in Soweto, that  Winnie Mandela's independence and generosity transformed her into an  international liberation figure in her own right.    She staged a one-woman resistance campaign, to the dismay of the white  authorities, by using stores, restaurants and public toilets that had been  declared whites-only. At the same time, she provided bread and soup for hungry  black children, started a community garden and turned her house into a medical  clinic.    Foreign diplomats and politicians traveled to see her. She was honored with  doctoral degrees and gifts from America and Europe.    In 1985, eight years after her banishment, she defied the government and  returned to Soweto. The authorities forcibly evicted her, but she returned the  next day. They arrested her again and again before a court ruled that she could  stay.    Back in Soweto, the township of 2.2 million outside Johannesburg, she opened an  office and launched a project to send blacks to college.    She also opened her home to young political activists. They called her ""Mama,""  and she treated them like her children, cooking for them, clothing them and  sending them to school.    When ""her boys,"" as she called them, wanted to form a soccer club, she got  local Soweto businesses to chip in for uniforms and equipment. The uniforms  carried the colors of the outlawed African National Congress.    The Mandela United football club, as it came to be known, did not play many  soccer matches. But its two dozen uniformed members accompanied Winnie Mandela  to rallies, political funerals and news conferences, usually making a grand  entrance shortly after the proceedings began.    She began to enjoy having the retinue -- one anti-apartheid activist called it  the ""queen's guard"" -- and being the center of attention.    ""Winnie has a feeling of self-importance, but it's not a false feeling,"" a  friend said recently. ""She is very important.""      Friends Loyal to Her    The soccer club, and other people who stayed at the Mandela home, were  obsequiously loyal. Even her relatives would leap nervously to their feet and  bow their heads when she entered a room. Those dependent on her for their  prestige as well as their next meal never dared disagree with Mama.    ""She was placed on a pedestal, and no one could tell her what to do,"" said a  senior black activist who is under a banning order that prevents his being  quoted by name. ""She was surrounded by 'yes' people, and that distorted her  judgment. She couldn't take people who said 'no.' ""    When out of her sight, members of the soccer club basked in the reflected glory  of the ""mother of the nation."" They demanded free entry to a Soweto discotheque  and swaggered around the township beating up people they didn't like.    Neighbors complained about the team, and anti-apartheid leaders urged Winnie  Mandela to disband it. She would listen and often agree. But she never took  action.    Winnie Mandela had felt no strong links to the country's anti-apartheid  organizations when she returned to Soweto, even though most opponents of  apartheid look to her imprisoned 70-year-old husband as the country's true  leader.    Hollywood was making movies about her. A 1985 autobiography called ""Part of My  Soul Went With Him"" was a best-seller. She had become an industry. Last year,  she agreed to allow a black American public relations man to market the Mandela  name, but her husband canceled the deal.    Winnie Mandela's independence struck many in the anti-apartheid movement as, at  best, conduct unbecoming the wife of so important a leader -- and, at worst,  plain arrogance.    In 1986, for example, she built a $250,000 home amid the shacks of Soweto, an  ostentatious display that gave the government ammunition in its effort to  undermine the credibility of the ANC. The house remains vacant.    ""She's a very unstable person with delusions of grandeur,"" said Mark Swilling,  a professor at the Center for Policy Studies who has had Winnie Mandela as a  political science student. She is working on an undergraduate degree in  politics and social work.    But others think she may have been manipulated by the soccer club.    ""She takes in people. She won't question them. She will take them at face  value,"" said Meer, the sociology professor who compiled ""Higher Than Hope.""    Last year, the Mandela home was burned down by youths allegedly provoked by a  Mandela United assault on a schoolgirl. Another community delegation pleaded  with Winnie Mandela to get the team out of her house.    ""We went to Winnie, but her attitude was that no one would tell her what to  do,"" a senior anti-apartheid leader said. ""That's been her attitude all along.  Had she been less individualistic, she wouldn't find herself in this position  today.""    Police contend that members of the Mandela soccer club and others of her  friends abducted four young activists at a Methodist church hostel in Soweto on  Dec. 29 and drove to the house where Winnie Mandela now stays.    In their affidavits, according to sources who have seen them, three of the four  say that Winnie Mandela arrived and began beating the four. The sworn  statements say the attack was taken over by the Mandela bodyguards and that one  of the four, 14-year-old Stompie Mokhetsi Seipei, was severely beaten. His  body, identified by fingerprints, was found Jan. 7, the police said.    Winnie Mandela denies that she or her bodyguards were involved in the beatings.  She says the youths were abducted to protect them from a church pastor who had  been sexually abusing them. The pastor and the church have denied this  allegation.    In the old days, Winnie Mandela did what she wanted, when she wanted, the white  government be damned. She still does what she wants, when she wants. But these  days, that means ignoring advice from her husband's most ardent supporters in  the anti-apartheid movement.    ""We aren't jealous of Winnie,"" said one of the liberation leaders responsible  for shunning her. ""But we're jealous for her name -- Mandela. It is being used  to deprive people of life and liberty, which is against everything we're in  business for.""    Winnie Mandela, meanwhile, remains loyal to her boys. Only a few days ago, she  was in her office on the telephone, busily hiring attorneys for the eight  people arrested so far in the case and insisting on their innocence.    ""She can be terribly exasperating,"" Meer said. ""But she's not what they say she  is.""

Mandela has instructed his wife to make no  public statements about the controversy surrounding herself and her band of  young bodyguards, Winnie Mandela's lawyer said Sunday.    Looking grim, she refused to talk to reporters after her three-hour visit to  Victor Verster Prison in Paarl, outside Cape Town.    Her attorney, Essa Moosa, refused to give details on the meeting.    The attorney would only say that Nelson Mandela instructed his wife not to  speak publicly about the controversy that has severely damaged her reputation.    The uproar centers on her bodyguards, who called themselves the Mandela United  soccer club. Anti-apartheid groups have renounced Winnie Mandela for ignoring  their appeals that she disband the group, claiming that the club has waged a  ""reign of terror"" in Soweto, the sprawling black township outside Johannesburg.    The situation worsened after three people who had direct or indirect links to  Winnie Mandela and her live-in bodyguards were killed in the last two months.  Two bodyguards have since been charged with murdering 14-year-old activist  Stompie Mokhetsi Seipei, whom soccer club members reportedly accused of being a  police informer.    Winnie Mandela visited her husband Feb. 15 and only recently decided to act on  his instruction to remove the soccer club members from her house.    Anti-apartheid groups have emphasized they still support Nelson Mandela, head  of the African National Congress guerrilla movement and the country's best  known black leader. Mandela has been serving a life sentence in prison since  1962, when he was convicted of sabotage.      Sought to Help Youths    Winnie Mandela, a trained social worker, formed Mandela United in 1986, saying  she wanted to organize activities for youths congregating on streets near her  house. But the group, numbering as many as 30, grew into an unofficial  bodyguard that seldom played soccer and often antagonized members of the  community.    The controversy came to a head last month when three young men told a Soweto  community meeting that the bodyguards abducted them Dec. 29 from the Methodist  church home of the Rev. Paul Verryn, a white pastor. They were taken to  Mandela's home in Soweto and were beaten. A fourth youth, Seipei, was abducted  at the same time, said the men, who implicated Mandela.    Mandela, who has denied involvement in Seipei's death and claims there is a  plot to discredit her, has said her bodyguards were trying to protect the four  young men, who she asserted were being sexually molested by Verryn. Verryn and  the Methodist church deny the charges.    The ANC's exiled leaders have appealed to blacks not to shun Winnie Mandela but  to unite to avoid manipulation by the South African government.

Looking grim, she refused to talk to reporters after her three-hour visit to  Victor Verster Prison in Paarl, outside Cape Town.    Her attorney, Essa Moosa, refused to give details on the meeting.    The attorney would only say that Nelson Mandela instructed his wife not to  speak publicly about the controversy that has severely damaged her reputation.    The uproar centers on her bodyguards, who called themselves the Mandela United  soccer club. Anti-apartheid groups have renounced Winnie Mandela for ignoring  their appeals that she disband the group, claiming that the club has waged a  ""reign of terror"" in Soweto, the sprawling black township outside Johannesburg.    The situation worsened after three people who had direct or indirect links to  Winnie Mandela and her live-in bodyguards were killed in the last two months.  Two bodyguards have since been charged with murdering 14-year-old activist  Stompie Mokhetsi Seipei, whom soccer club members reportedly accused of being a  police informer.    Winnie Mandela visited her husband Feb. 15 and only recently decided to act on  his instruction to remove the soccer club members from her house.    Anti-apartheid groups have emphasized they still support Nelson Mandela, head  of the African National Congress guerrilla movement and the country's best  known black leader. Mandela has been serving a life sentence in prison since  1962, when he was convicted of sabotage.      Sought to Help Youths    Winnie Mandela, a trained social worker, formed Mandela United in 1986, saying  she wanted to organize activities for youths congregating on streets near her  house. But the group, numbering as many as 30, grew into an unofficial  bodyguard that seldom played soccer and often antagonized members of the  community.    The controversy came to a head last month when three young men told a Soweto  community meeting that the bodyguards abducted them Dec. 29 from the Methodist  church home of the Rev. Paul Verryn, a white pastor. They were taken to  Mandela's home in Soweto and were beaten. A fourth youth, Seipei, was abducted  at the same time, said the men, who implicated Mandela.    Mandela, who has denied involvement in Seipei's death and claims there is a  plot to discredit her, has said her bodyguards were trying to protect the four  young men, who she asserted were being sexually molested by Verryn. Verryn and  the Methodist church deny the charges.    The ANC's exiled leaders have appealed to blacks not to shun Winnie Mandela but  to unite to avoid manipulation by the South African government.

According to the newspaper a secret ANC report, in which  it was found that Mrs Mandela had stolen money from and  defrauded her own party to the tune of hundreds of thousands of  rands, was leaked to a DISPATCH correspondent in Cape Town.    A recent report in the DISPATCH said the ANC was still  trying  to work out how much money was missing. Mrs Mandela, who is  widely tipped as a future cabinet minister in the new South  Africa, had refused to appear before an ANC commission into the  affair headed by late ANC chief Oliver Tambo, it said.    The ANC commission's report, claimed the DISPATCH, had found  that Mrs Mandela had been caught counting piles of United States  dollars and cheques after a visit to the United States. The  money was ""donations"" Mrs Mandela had collected during her visit  and had failed to declare to the ANC.    There was also evidence that Mrs Mandela had pocketed  ""substantial"" amounts of interest yielded by funds deposited  into her account. These funds were legally destined for the  ANC's social welfare department.    Mrs Mandela is also suspected in the ANC report, according  to  the dispatch, of taking an alleged R190,000 [rand] ""kickback"" on  a farm bought by the ANC for returning exiles. The price paid  for the Walkerville property was R350,000, yet it was only worth  R160,000. Mrs Mandela was a main party in the deal.    According to the ANC report, Mrs Mandela had admitted  shaving  R74,000 off a donation destined for the ANC's social welfare  department. The money had, to date, not been paid back. A  statement issued by Mrs Mandela on Saturday said she had  instructed her lawyers to undertake litigation against the  DISPATCH.     "

0,FT922-13245 ,"FT922-13245 _AN-CDMAYACLFT 920413   FT  13 APR 92 / Winnie Mandela in fresh row over beating      By PATTI WALDMEIR      JOHANNESBURG   A CO-DEFENDANT in last year's kidnap and assault trial of Mrs Winnie Mandela, wife of the African National Congress leader, Mr Nelson Mandela, has told a Johannesburg newspaper that he was present when Mrs Mandela beat four young men in her Soweto home, writes Patti Waldmeir in Johannesburg. The claims, published in the Johannesburg Sunday Times, will heighten controversy surrounding the role of Mrs Mandela in the 1988 beatings. They follow allegations made a fortnight ago that Mrs Mandela ordered the murder of a prominent doctor who would have been a key figure in the case. In light of those claims, police are re-examining the doctor's death, which had been treated as a robbery-related murder. The charges are an embarrassment to the ANC, in which Mrs Mandela holds senior positions. However, her influence in the organisation has declined sharply since the trial and she is seldom seen in public with her husband, leading to speculation that they will soon become legally separated. Mr John Morgan, Mrs Mandela's former driver, told the Sunday Times that he lied in court to protect her during last year's trial. Mrs Mandela was convicted as an accessory after the fact to assault and given a one-year prison sentence, as well as a five-year sentence for planning the kidnapping of the boys. The case is subject to appeal. The judge failed to find Mrs Mandela guilty of assault because he accepted her alibi that she was not present when the boys were beaten - which Mr Morgan now disputes. One of the four victims of the beatings later died, and Mr Morgan told the newspaper that Mrs Mandela ordered him to remove the corpse from the house. 'I was told by Winnie to pick up the dog and dump him,' it quoted Mr Morgan as saying. Mr Morgan received a one-year suspended sentence during the trial.  The Financial Times   London Page 5  "

The wife of Mr Nelson Mandela, ANC deputy president, lost a secret ballot for the presidency of the ANC Women's League. This post carries automatic membership of the ANC's policy-making National Executive Committee, under the organisation's proposed new constitution. Mrs Gertrude Shope, a moderate on the ANC national executive, became Women's League president late on Saturday night when she took 400 votes to the 196 of Mrs Mandela, who represents the organisation's most radical wing. Despite her defeat, Mrs Mandela seems likely to be elected in July to an expanded, 120-member ANC national executive.  The Financial Times   London Page 3  "

Looking pale and stunned, 72-year-old Mr Mandela listened from the public gallery as Mr Justice Michael Stegmann told the Rand Supreme Court in Johannesburg that Mrs Mandela had 'showed herself on a number of occasions to be a calm, composed, deliberate and unblushing liar'. Mr Mandela was serving a life sentence for conspiring to overthrow the state when the crimes took place. Under South African law kidnapping is a capital offence, although Mrs Mandela is certain to face a lesser punishment. Sentence will be announced later today, after evidence in mitigation from the defence. Legal experts familiar with the case said it seemed likely she would face a period in jail. Mr Justice Stegmann said he accepted Mrs Mandela's alibi, that she was on her way to the town of Brandfort, over 180 miles away, when the kidnapping and assaults took place. But he found that she and a co-accused, Mrs Xoliswa Falati, had conspired to kidnap the four activists, including a 14-year-old boy, Stompie Seipei, who was later found with his throat slit in a Soweto ditch. Mrs Mandela, he said, was one of the 'moving spirits' behind the kidnapping. To imagine that it had taken place without her prior knowledge was like imagining 'Hamlet without the Prince', he said. He further found Mrs Mandela guilty of accessory after the fact to the crime of assault with intent to commit grievous bodily harm against the four boys. This is a less serious crime that than of the assault itself for which she was originally charged. The four were seriously assaulted in an outside room at her Soweto home on December 29 1988, leaving the walls of the room spattered with blood. She was absent at the time, but on her return two days later, he found that she must have known of or suspected the assaults and thus had 'assisted' and 'associated herself' with the attackers. A radiantly smiling Mrs Mandela said outside the court: 'You can see how delighted I am'. Clipping her words short, and only barely suppressing her rage, she said: 'As long as you all now know that I did not assault any child, that's all that matters to me. The rest I leave to my lawyers.' Her reaction was in marked contrast to that of her husband, who stood by her side looking grey with shock, his normally erect shoulders bowed beneath his tightly belted overcoat. Mr Mandela's posture and deeply pained facial expression raised fears about his health and ability to withstand the distress of seeing his wife go to jail. Mrs Mandela's conviction could further strain relations between the ANC, of which she is a senior leader, and the government at a time when the two sides are involved in tough negotiations over measures to end township violence. The ANC has threatened to pull out of talks on the country's political future unless Pretoria agrees to ban spears from public gatherings by Thursday.

The court amended the penalty to a R15,000 (Pounds 3,025) fine or one year in prison, and a two-year term conditionally suspended for five years. It dismissed her original conviction on a charge of accessory to assault on four black youths at her home in Soweto. The decision is likely to defuse potential trouble among young black supporters during South Africa's transition to democracy. But criminal experts said it appeared an unusually light sentence for kidnapping. Mrs Mandela was originally convicted and sentenced in May 1991 to five years' imprisonment on four counts of kidnapping and one year as an accessory to assault. The Appeal Court also ordered her to pay compensation of R5,000 each to the three surviving victims of the 1989 kidnappings and assaults. The body of a fourth victim, 14-year-old Stompie Seipei, was found in a field in January 1989. Mr Justice Corbett, the chief justice, said that he believed a substantial fine, suspended sentence and payment of compensation to the victims was a fit punishment which would also achieve a measure of 'social justice'. Mrs Mandela's estranged husband said yesterday, after meeting President F W de Klerk, that the ANC and government were very close to agreement on a date for the first all-race elections. It was their second meeting this week. Mr Mandela told reporters the two sides had made substantial progress on constitutional issues. Mr de Klerk concurred, saying: 'We are doing our level best to ensure progress in the negotiation process. We have worked around the clock. . . and we will continue to work until we reach the moment where further progress can be registered.'   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.

AFRICA RITES      By SCOTT KRAFT, Times Staff Writer      TUMAHOLE, South Africa      A thousand singing and chanting mourners turned out in this rural black  township Saturday to bury favored son Stompie Mokhetsi Seipei, the 14-year-old  militant anti-apartheid leader whose murder has been blamed on Winnie Mandela's  band of young bodyguards.    ""Stompie, your terribly violent death was an unspeakable crime,"" Methodist  Bishop Peter Storey said as he gazed at the small, gray and white wooden  casket. ""But your childhood was already dead. South Africa took away your  innocence.""    The white-haired clergyman then voiced a plea for the country's black majority  to heal the wounds created by allegations against Mandela and her live-in  bodyguards, the so-called Mandela United soccer club.    ""Retaliation cannot bring this child back to life,"" Storey said. ""Do not injure  Stompie further by using this funeral as a platform for revenge.""    Mourners stood atop the wooden pews in St. John the Baptist Church, singing  freedom songs, clapping their hands and chanting support for the guerrilla war  being waged against Pretoria by the exiled African National Congress.      'A Young Lion'    Stompie was eulogized as a courageous freedom fighter, ""a young lion"" of the  liberation movement who, at the age of 11, was the youngest person ever  detained by the South African authorities and who later commanded a  1,000-strong army of children under 14 in this township.    But the funeral and burial here, 75 miles south of Johannesburg, was subdued  compared to other political funerals in South Africa in recent years. No one  mentioned the special circumstances of Stompie's death. And neither Mandela nor  any members of her bodyguard force were present -- or mentioned by name.    Stompie and three men in their 20s were abducted Dec. 29 from the Methodist  church home of the Rev. Paul Verryn, a white pastor, in the sprawling Soweto  township near Johannesburg. Police and civic leaders say the kidnapers were  members of Mandela United, the controversial soccer club whose members serve as  live-in bodyguards for Mandela, wife of jailed nationalist leader Nelson R.  Mandela.    The four were taken to Mandela's red-brick Soweto home, where they were beaten,  according to police and sources in the township. The body of Stompie, whom  Mandela United members had accused of being a police informer, was found eight  days later. He had been beaten beyond recognition and stabbed in the throat,  the coroner said.      Two Charged    One of the three survivors escaped and the other two were released after  anti-apartheid leaders intervened with Mandela. So far, the soccer team coach  and a team member have been charged with murder in the case. The team bus  driver has been arrested but not charged.    Mandela, who has denied involvement in Stompie's death, claims her bodyguards  were trying to protect the four men, whom she asserted were being sexually  molested by Verryn, the pastor. Verryn and the Methodist church deny the  assertions.    Resentment over the team's activities has been growing for months in Soweto,  and anti-apartheid activists fear that community anger with the Mandela soccer  club already has spilled over into a bloody factional war.    A Mandela United team member was killed last month, for example, and on  Wednesday a 13-year-old was shot to death when a gang of unidentified men  opened fire on the home of activists accused in the team member's murder.    The ANC, the primary guerrilla group fighting white-minority rule, issued a  statement Saturday from its exile headquarters in Zambia calling on blacks to  avoid ""fratricidal"" attacks in the townships.    The message here also was conciliatory.    ""We shouldn't point fingers at other people,"" said McLean Skhosane, a Tumahole  political activist who conducted the funeral. ""Stompo was interested in unity.  Let his death not divide us.""      Mandela Criticized    Leading anti-apartheid activists, angered by the soccer team's activities and  Mandela's unwillingness to disband the group, recently called on South African  blacks to distance themselves from Mandela.    Saturday's funeral was the first for a political activist not restricted by  authorities since the current state of emergency was declared in 1986. Some  political analysts say that Mandela's troubles, and the rivalries among  anti-apartheid groups, help bolster government assertions that a South Africa  under black rule would be characterized by violent disagreements.    ""The government likes to say this was just another case of blacks killing  blacks,"" the Rev. Lewis Balink, the church pastor, said before the services  began. ""But the people know better. They know it was the system (apartheid)  that killed him.""    ""We confess with shame the way it (Stompie's life) was ended,"" Storey said in  his funeral prayer. ""(But) this land's violence can insinuate itself into all  our souls.""

0,FT944-3872 ,"FT944-3872 _AN-ELLBEAFAFT 941210   FT  10 DEC 94 / Books: An epic study of the genesis of greatness - Patti Waldmeir on Nelson Mandela, the man who refused to hate      By PATTI WALDMEIR   LONG WALK TO FREEDOM by Nelson Mandela Little, Brown Pounds 20, 630 pages Everybody likes a story where good triumphs over evil, where great men do battle over humanity's most dearly-cherished ideals: freedom, equality, and the brotherhood of man. That is why South Africa's story fascinated the world. It was a natural thriller, a story of human greatness culminating in one of history's truly transcendent moments. As a crowd-pleaser, it could not fail. Neither can the latest contribution to the tale: Nelson Mandela's autobiography. Mandela, who has recently completed six months as president of a new, democratic South Africa is one of the most compelling figures of the 20th century. He refuses to hate, although hatred would seem not only understandable but more rational than its opposite. He is tireless in wooing those who oppressed him, even to the point of angering his own supporters. He always takes the long view. No wonder right-wing whites say he is a gift from God, and supporters of the former ruling National party admit to praying nightly for his well-being. Mandela is not a saint, though. And although his autobiography reflects a character seldom given to self-doubt - he seems certain that he always had right firmly on his side - it profiles a man, not a super-natural agent of good. His memoirs are never merely self-indulgent: each episode represents an essential building block in the construction of the Mandela character. From the moment of his birth into the royal family of the Thembu tribe in the Transkei black homeland, he begins to learn the lessons of leadership which he draws on - 600 pages and seven decades later - to guide a reluctant African National Congress to eventual agreement with the white minority government. For although Mandela often disclaims personal responsibility for the deal which ended apartheid - going out of his way to stress the deadlock-breaking initiatives taken by, among others, South African Communist party chairman Joe Slovo - this is the story of the political and emotional evolution of a great leader of men. There are glimpses of human weakness: after young Mandela flees an arranged marriage in the Transkei, he leaves a trail of lies and half-truths which land him in endless trouble. And, to the very end, he remains unable to detect guilt in his wife, Winnie, despite her conviction on kidnapping charges; the book's most moving passages reveal his love for the beautiful young Winnie, his desire for her during decades in prison, and his devotion to her despite their 1992 decision to separate. Winnie is the centre of Mandela's personal tragedy: that he was forced to sacrifice his personal life to the liberation cause, not only while in prison but for the five years since his release. Mandela today lives largely alone, bereft of the family comforts which formed the substance of so many prison dreams. Forced to choose between his role as father of the nation or father of the family, Mandela knows he chose correctly. He regrets the consequences - among them, the pressures which probably helped to drive Winnie to illegal acts - but he does not regret his choice. Commitment made that inevitable. Mandela avoids dwelling on this personal tragedy, or on the demeaning and de-humanising experiences of his long life as a prisoner. He mentions them almost in passing and focuses instead on his efforts, often successful, to triumph over his captors by using persuasion and charm - plus his sharp wits as a trained lawyer - to defeat a brutal system. Nowhere is Mandela's extraordinary character apparent more readily than in his relationship with his warders: his steadfast refusal to blame the individual for the evils of a political system; his joy at detecting a 'glimmer of humanity' in one of his guards; his patient efforts to persuade them of his cause - efforts which, surprisingly, often succeeded. This tale of struggle and suffering is leavened throughout by Mandela's impish wit: ghost-writer Richard Stengel is remarkably adept at capturing the voice of Mandela at its most relaxed and entertaining. Although his prepared speeches often are heavy and dull, Mandela is a superb impromptu raconteur. This survives Stengel's editing of the first parts of the book - composed in jail and buried in the prison garden for safekeeping - and the fact that he wrote most of the latter section on the basis of interviews with Mandela. Overwhelmingly, though, this is not a book about Mandela's love of gardening (he provided home-grown vegetables to the prison warders); or about his sight-seeing forays in the Cape, guided by warders who tormented him unwittingly by giving him opportunities to escape which he knew he must not take; or about his decision to build a retirement home in the Transkei based on the floor plan of his prison bungalow. It is a serious book about his political evolution - from Thembu loyalist, to African nationalist, to violent revolutionary, to world-class statesman. It is one of the most extraordinary political tales of the 20th century and well worth the investment for anyone truly interested in the genesis of greatness.

Keeping Keys and Roelf Meyer and the portfolios of the three  IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] ministers ""strike a good balance,""  while ""most interest -- and criticism -- has centered"" on ANC  appointees such as Alfred Nzo and the omission of Cyril  Ramaphosa. The deputy premiership for the ""controversial Winnie  Mandela is bound to raise hackles in some quarters."" The  ""absence"" of Freedom Front leader Viljoen and ""the entire white  right is unfortunate."" However, the ""most pertinent question"" is  how the ""rainbow Cabinet"" will function. ""Winnie Mandela will  need to co-operate closely with her minister, the IFP's Dr. Ben  Ngubane. Bantu Holomisa is deputy to Environment Affairs and  Tourism Minister, Dawie de Villiers. Home Affairs Mangosuthu  Buthelezi must work together with Public Works' Jeff Radebe, the  ANC's southern Natal leader and a bitter enemy in the past.""  Were the implications not so serious, it might be said these  combinations were put together by someone with a fine sense of  humor. But co-operation at Cabinet level will be vital if the  new dispensation is to work effectively."" Cabinet members and  their deputies ""will have to approach their new roles in the  spirit of reconciliation so apparent in President Mandela's  every action since assuming the presidency.""    BUSINESS DAY    Cabinet of Reconciliation -- ""President's Nelson Mandela's  insistence on Tuesday that the entire nation should give equal  respect to the two halves of the double-barrelled national  anthem was yet another symbolic illustration of what is more  materially apparent in the construction of the Cabinet,"" begins  the Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 13 May in a page-10  editorial. ""From the perspective of those who may have had  fears about the future and the ANC's plans for it, Mandela has  gone far further than could reasonably have been asked of him in  giving meaning to the concept of reconciliation."" Both the  National Party and the Inkatha Freedom Party have been given  ""more Cabinet posts than their electoral performances entitled  them to""....and have been given ""quality portfolios which should  build public confidence generally."" BUSINESS DAY adds that  Buthelezi's appointment to a ""national rather than regional""  portfolio is ""visionary."" The positioning of the ANC's ""two  `unguided missiles' -- Winnie Mandela and Bantu Holomisa"" also  shows ""extensive thought."" The idea being that they can cause  less harm inside government than outside. The editorial writes  that ""it seems that reconciliation is a higher priority than  efficiency and experience.""    NEW NATION    Foreign Involvement in Ending Apartheid Viewed -- ""It was a  joyous week for all South Africans as we were joined by the  world in celebrating the inauguration of President Mandela, who  has over decades come to personify the ideals that so many had  given up their lives for."" So begins the Johannesburg NEW  NATION in English on 13 May in a page-7 editorial. ""However, it  must be of concern to many that, while statesmen from countries  to the north of us were acknowledged in as far as they were  accorded places alongside leaders from Britain and the United  States, there was no specific mention of the scale of the  sacrifices that their people made."" Angola, Mozambique, Zambia,  and Tanzania are mentioned, but most the editorial's praise is  reserved for Cuba. ""What needs to be said very forcefully is  that we might not have been in a position to celebrate a victory  this week had it not been for the Cubans, who in the spirit of  internationalism, committed their lives to defeating apartheid's  defence force at Cuito Cuanavale.""

Botha's surprise ""courtesy visit"" with jailed nationalist  leader Nelson R.

To suggest otherwise, when Mandela is unable to freely consult with his people,  ""is nothing short of political mischief . . . designed to sow confusion in the  minds of our people and of the outside world,"" said Chikane, flanked by  Mandela's wife, Winnie, at a news conference in Soweto.    ""As Mandela himself has said, 'Prisoners cannot enter into contracts. Only free  men can negotiate,' "" Chikane added.    The 45-minute meeting Wednesday between Botha and Mandela at the presidential  mansion in Cape Town, disclosed by the government Saturday, was an informal  chat over tea, and Justice Minister Kobie Coetsee said that possible  negotiations and policy matters were not discussed. Botha's white minority-led  government has over the years repeatedly refused to negotiate with Mandela's  banned guerrilla group, the African National Congress, saying that it does not  ""negotiate with terrorists.""    Anglican Archbishop Desmond M. Tutu, the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize winner, said he  was encouraged that Botha ""has, at long last, heeded the calls of those who are  interested in negotiations."" But he said he was puzzled by the timing of the  meeting, coming amid the ruling National Party's campaign for the Sept. 6  general elections.    Winnie Mandela said Sunday that she intends to visit her husband this week to  find out why he had agreed to meet Botha.    Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi, the moderate leader of the 2-million-member Zulu  nation, said the meeting meant that the 70-year-old Mandela's release from  prison, where he has been held for 26 years of a life sentence for sabotage and  attempting to overthrow the state, ""is now only a question of time.""      'One of Last Great Gestures'    The meeting, the first publicly known face-to-face encounter between the two  men, ""is certainly one of the last great gestures for which Mr. Botha will  always be remembered by black South Africa,"" Buthelezi said.    Although government officials described the meeting as important, and likely to  improve South Africa's image overseas, many political analysts here said they  considered the unusual get-together little more than the rogue act of an  outgoing president with no authority to negotiate the country's future.    Botha, 73, will step down after the parliamentary elections, after losing a  bitter power struggle within his own National Party. He resigned in February as  party leader and recently refused to attend the party convention or a farewell  dinner that the party had planned for him.    Some analysts think Botha arranged the meeting with Mandela either to confound  his party, to take credit for beginning the process toward peace or simply to  meet the man whose incarceration has caused the government so many headaches.  The two men did not discuss or plan further meetings, the government said.      'President's Prerogative'    If the National Party wins the parliamentary elections as is widely expected,  the new party leader, Frederik W. de Klerk, will become president, and  government sources have suggested that a wide array of reform measures,  including Mandela's release, would then be possible. De Klerk has declined to  comment, except to say ""it is the president's prerogative"" to meet whom he  wishes.    The right-wing Conservative Party, the National Party's chief opponent in the  elections, said it was ""astounded by the fact that our head of state cordially  entertains a convicted criminal in the presidency."" Conservative Party  information officer Koos van der Merwe said he was demanding ""some straight  answers from the government.""    Mandela's African National Congress and leaders of other anti-apartheid groups  have said that meaningful negotiations about the nation's future cannot begin  until Mandela and all political prisoners are released, the three-year-old  state of emergency is lifted, the bans on the ANC and other groups are lifted  and exiles are allowed to return home. Hundreds of white South Africans have  made pilgrimages to ANC headquarters in Lusaka, Zambia, in recent months,  however, to talk with the outlawed group and, in almost every case, have urged  the government to do the same.    Mandela, considered by millions of South Africa's voteless blacks as their true  leader, is being held on a prison farm about 60 miles from Cape Town. He has,  over the years, refused many conditional offers of release, declining, for  example, to accept exile or to renounce violence in exchange for his freedom.

Two of the country's largest-circulation daily newspapers are in Johannesburg  -- the Star, which strongly supports reform but opposes the ANC position on  sanctions and the armed liberation struggle, and the Citizen, a conservative  paper that supports the government.    The Star and the Citizen traded editorials on everything from Winnie Mandela's  warm reception by American civil rights leaders to Nelson Mandela's support for  Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat and Libyan leader  Moammar Kadafi.    Here is a sampling:     In an editorial headlined ""The View From The ANC's Side"" on June 25, the Star  said:     ""Perspective plays curious tricks. This newspaper has criticized Mr. Mandela  for demanding sustained sanctions; it has argued that the move from apartheid  is irreversible and has felt something of the irritation displayed by  government at what seems to be foot dragging by the ANC.

In a June 26 editorial headlined ""Winnie,"" the Citizen said:     ""Mr. Nelson Mandela, the ANC deputy president, never talks like a racist. He  tries to reassure whites that they have a safe future if the ANC takes over. He  never utters a word of recrimination about the past.

AFRICA LEGALIZES MANDELA'S PARTY, WILL FREE HIM SOON;    DE KLERK SAYS HE PLANS TO GIVE VOTE TO BLACKS      From Reuters      CAPE TOWN, South Africa      In a speech that launched a new era for South Africa, President Frederik W. de  Klerk today lifted a 30-year ban on the African National Congress and announced  that its jailed figurehead, Nelson R. Mandela, will soon be released.    In his watershed address to Parliament, De Klerk said the ANC and    other black nationalist movements will be legalized immediately.    ""The season of violence is over. The time for reconstruction and reconciliation  has arrived,"" he told the white-dominated Parliament's opening session in a  speech setting the scene for a negotiated settlement to South Africa's  political deadlock.    De Klerk said his long-term aim is the formulation of a new constitution that  will give the vote to all South Africans, regardless of color, and that will  put an end to racial domination.    Education Minister Stoffel van der Merwe said the form of universal franchise  would have to be negotiated with black leaders but that it would not let the  black majority dominate whites.    De Klerk said his government will decide on a date for Mandela's release ""soon""  but added that a short delay is unavoidable.    ""I wish to put it plainly that the government has taken a firm decision to  release Mr. Mandela unconditionally,"" he said.    Government sources said shortly after the announcement that Mandela, jailed for  life in 1964 for plotting to overthrow white rule, could be free within a week.    Other measures announced in De Klerk's speech included a temporary halt to  executions, an easing of restrictions on reporting political unrest and a  six-month limit to political detention without trial.    De Klerk's sweeping concessions were greeted cautiously by ANC leaders but with  jubilation by thousands of anti-apartheid activists who turned out in the  streets of Cape Town and Johannesburg to celebrate.    Mandela's wife, Winnie, who led a 5,000-strong protest march through Cape Town,  said De Klerk had not gone far enough and that apartheid should be scrapped  immediately.    ""We are not prepared to accept a bone with no meat. Unbanning the ANC and  leaving apartheid as it is is no deal,"" she told the marchers.    In Harare, a senior ANC official said the movement saw ""some substantive  changes,"" and veteran ANC leader Walter Sisulu told a news conference in  Stockholm: ""Victory is in sight.""    World reaction was swift and generally positive, with some of the warmest  praise coming from British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who said she would  invite both De Klerk and Mandela to London for talks.    President Bush welcomed De Klerk's package, but said further development of the  trends in it would be needed before he ends economic sanctions against South  Africa. Bush has invited Mandela and De Klerk to Washington.    Even hard-line black African apartheid critics joined in the chorus of praise,  although Nigeria, Zambia and Ghana said De Klerk should have done more.    Inside South Africa, moderate black leader Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi, head of  the 2-million-strong Zulu Inkatha movement, said De Klerk had now proved he was  sincere about apartheid reform.    The news from Cape Town immediately boosted South Africa's beleaguered economy,  and the Johannesburg stock exchange closed sharply higher at record levels.

The time for reconstruction and reconciliation  has arrived,"" he told the white-dominated Parliament's opening session in a  speech setting the scene for a negotiated settlement to South Africa's  political deadlock.    De Klerk said his long-term aim is the formulation of a new constitution that  will give the vote to all South Africans, regardless of color, and that will  put an end to racial domination.    Education Minister Stoffel van der Merwe said the form of universal franchise  would have to be negotiated with black leaders but that it would not let the  black majority dominate whites.    De Klerk said his government will decide on a date for Mandela's release ""soon""  but added that a short delay is unavoidable.    ""I wish to put it plainly that the government has taken a firm decision to  release Mr. Mandela unconditionally,"" he said.    Government sources said shortly after the announcement that Mandela, jailed for  life in 1964 for plotting to overthrow white rule, could be free within a week.    Other measures announced in De Klerk's speech included a temporary halt to  executions, an easing of restrictions on reporting political unrest and a  six-month limit to political detention without trial.    De Klerk's sweeping concessions were greeted cautiously by ANC leaders but with  jubilation by thousands of anti-apartheid activists who turned out in the  streets of Cape Town and Johannesburg to celebrate.    Mandela's wife, Winnie, who led a 5,000-strong protest march through Cape Town,  said De Klerk had not gone far enough and that apartheid should be scrapped  immediately.    ""We are not prepared to accept a bone with no meat. Unbanning the ANC and  leaving apartheid as it is is no deal,"" she told the marchers.    In Harare, a senior ANC official said the movement saw ""some substantive  changes,"" and veteran ANC leader Walter Sisulu told a news conference in  Stockholm: ""Victory is in sight.""    World reaction was swift and generally positive, with some of the warmest  praise coming from British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who said she would  invite both De Klerk and Mandela to London for talks.    President Bush welcomed De Klerk's package, but said further development of the  trends in it would be needed before he ends economic sanctions against South  Africa. Bush has invited Mandela and De Klerk to Washington.    Even hard-line black African apartheid critics joined in the chorus of praise,  although Nigeria, Zambia and Ghana said De Klerk should have done more.    Inside South Africa, moderate black leader Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi, head of  the 2-million-strong Zulu Inkatha movement, said De Klerk had now proved he was  sincere about apartheid reform.    The news from Cape Town immediately boosted South Africa's beleaguered economy,  and the Johannesburg stock exchange closed sharply higher at record levels.

He made  this point during an address at a conference of the Congress of  Traditional Leaders of SA (Contralesa) in Johannesburg.    Saying the creation of the volkstaat [homeland] council was  aimed at resolving the question of an Afrikaner state in a  responsible manner, Mr Mandela said discussions with Dr  Hartzenberg had already seen the CP leader shift away from the  Afrikaner weerstandsbeweging [AWB, Afrikaner Resistance  Movement].    ""We want to bring the right wing into the same process that  the National Party finds itself in to prevent bloodshed in our  country.    ""As a result of our discussions, we got General Constand  Viljoen to move away from the rigid position of the Afrikaner  volksfront. Similarly, we have been able to get Dr Hartzenberg  away from the Eugene Terreblanche's AWB,"" he said to loud  applause.    ""We as a government of national unity have to be responsible  when we deal with their (the Afrikaners') demands. If the  Afrikaners decide they want a volkstaat, we will deal with it in  a particular manner.    ""But before that, we want to know whether they do represent  all Afrikaners in our country,"" Mr Mandela said.    Regarding structures for traditional African leaders, the  president said it was imperative greater urgency was given to  creating the bodies catered for in the interim constitution.    ""I refer to the setting up of the houses of traditional  leaders in the provinces where this is required; the  constitution of the National Council of Traditional Leaders and  the drafting of legislation regarding the functioning of these  institution.    ""In consultation with the provinces, we shall ensure that  the  relevant ministries as well as the commission on provincial  government immediately set this process in motion.""    Mr Mandela added that his government recognised the equality  of all traditional leaders and kings.    ""Whilst we do acknowledge that there are regional varieties,  this cannot be interpreted to mean that traditional leaders in  any given area should occupy a rung above the others. No king is  above other kings in our country. All our kings will enjoy the  same status,"" he said.    Also present at the conference were Minister of  Constitutional Affairs Mr Roelf Meyer, his deputy Mohammed Valli  Moosa and Deputy Minister of Arts, Culture, Science and  Technology Mrs Winnie Mandela.

The ANC's national executive committee ruled that her  kidnapping conviction would be classed as a political offence  and she was therefore eligible to stand for Parliament.    More than 500 delegates from the ANC and its Patriotic Front  allies met at a Johannesburg hotel yesterday to cast their final  vote for national representatives to stand in the April 27  election.    The ANC's list of 200 candidates, which was compiled in  December last year, will be altered slightly to accommodate  candidates proposed by the Patriotic Front organisations.    The list of national candidates was drawn up after months of  branch and regional conferences involving thousands of  ANC-alliance members. The process cost over R[rand]2-million.    The ANC's list shows overwhelming support for the ANC  negotiators and has a strong racial and language mix.    ANC president Nelson Mandela tops the provisional list.  International relations head Thabo Mbeki, secretary general  Cyril Ramaphosa, SACP [South African Communist Party] chairman  Joe Slovo, former Cosatu boss Jay Naidoo and senior negotiator  Mohammed Vallie Moosa are in the top 10. Other candidates who  received popular support were Transkei military leader  Major-General Bantu Holomisa, Natal Midlands leader Harry Gwala  and former Youth League president Peter Mokaba.    In addition to Mrs Mandela, women candidates with much  support were former Women's League secretary general Baleka  Kgositsile, Hilda Ndude and Adelaide Tambo. Popular Western  Cape executive member Cheryl Carolus, who was mooted as a  possible Health Minister in a future cabinet, this week withdrew  her name from the list saying she wanted to work on health  issues.    In addition to finalising the list of 200 candidates for the  national assembly, the ANC has drawn up a list of 200 regional  representatives for the national assembly and its list of  candidates for the provincial legislatures.    Seven candidates for the provincial premierships have  already  been decided, but contenders still have to be chosen for the  Western and North West.    In the Western Cape, Umkhonto weSizwe [Spear of the Nation;  MK -- ANC military wing] militant Tony Yengeni and the more  moderate Dr Allan Boesak are set to fight it out for the ANC  nomination today.    Dr Boesak is expected to trounce Mr Yengeni.    The Western Cape premier nominations have been the scene of  continuing battles between pragmatists who see Dr Boesak as the  organisation's best chance to capture coloured voters and  militants who see him as too moderate and unattractive to voters.    Mr Yengeni, an MK hardliner who is close to Mrs Mandela, was  deposed as ANC Western Cape secretary last year after a fiery  battle at the organisation's regional congress.    North West nominee Essop Pahad declined to stand this week,  saying he felt he would not be the best person to attract ANC  votes in the province. However, ANC sources have suggested the  SACP secretariat instructed him to turn down the nomination.  ANC election official Popo Molefe is being mooted as a possible  candidate in Mr Pahad's place.    The ANC's deputy secretary-general Jacob Zuma is the ANC's  choice for premier in Natal after beating the militant Natal  Midlands leader Harry Gwala and southern Natal chairman Jeff  Radebe.    The other candidates for premierships are Tokyo Sexwale for  the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging], former UDF  [United Democratic Front] secretary general Terror Lekota for  the Free State, the late Oliver Tambo's speech writer Ngoako  Ramatlhodi for the Northern Transvaal, legal department head  Matthew Phosa for the Eastern Transvaal, Mane Dipico for the  Northern Cape, and SACP central committee member and former  Robben Island prisoner Raymond Mhlaba for the Eastern Cape.    Despite the voting at this weekend's conference, the ANC's  national executive could make further changes to the list this  week if they wish to include more women or candidates from areas  which are not well represented.

The Poet is Breytenbach, an Afrikaner who fell out with his country(men) when he married a Vietnamese in the heyday of apartheid in 1973. They were given a special dispensation to visit his country, a trip which produced A Season in Paradise. He became politicised and returned illegally on behalf of the ANC in 1975. He was jailed for seven years - which led to The True Confessions of an Albino Terrorist. He describes Return to Paradise, an account of a three-month tour of the country in 1991, as the last part of a triptych. He describes a transformed country country which used to be his own but is no longer. 'Why did I come back? . . . .to complete the incomplete, for annihilation, deathwish. Why will I not return to stay? Too late now. Foreigner here. Painted monkey. Bitter dreams . . .' He is saddened as he zig-zags around the country, interspersing what must be diary entries with recollections of visits to West Africa, where in 1987 he helped to arrange the first meetings between South African progressives and Black Africa. Breytenbach says: 'I am looking at the future and it chills me to the bone'. His host, friend and sponsor for the visit is Van Zyl Slabbert, the politician-academic who quit the whites-only parliament to the anger of his fellow Progressives in 1986. At the end they have an awful row. Slabbert shouts at him, 'You make out as if you're the only ones who cares' It is the South African liberals' indictment of the exiles. This is a fascinating, quiet, detailed journal, full of acute and witty insight and striking vignettes. South Africa's two most famous women are 'Helen' and 'Winnie'. Helen Suzman was an MP for 26 years and for half of them was the single truly anti-apartheid figure in the Cape Town Assembly. She was - and is - a wonderful woman, brave, formidable, indefatigable, witty, twinkling. She started out on the liberal wing of the United Party in 1953, split in 1959 to form the Progressive Party, soldiered on alone from 1961-74, and only stepped down in 1989, not entirely happy about the emergence of the present opposition Democratic Party. Her autobiography is disappointing only because it does not go far enough. It reads like an extended version of one of her famous Report-Back meetings to her posh northern Johannesburg constituency - it describes the detail of her political career but holds back not just on personal things but on many other areas of delicacy: for example, her fury at Van Zyl's desertion of the parliamentary party is inadequately reported, and her thoughts about 'Winnie' could surely have been developed now that she does not have to play the politician. Helen Suzman has her place in the history books, and the affection of many of the leaders of the New Sarth Efrica, but there is a necessary argument about her role. Did she somehow help legitimise an utterly undemocratic government which was happy to let her travel the world abusing them? Was she right, Van Zyl wrong? And, more important, can we now see that her passionate opposition to sanctions throughout the 1980s was misguided? Or not? Perhaps she should be best remembered as a most valiant champion of the oppressed - 'Our Lady of the Prisoners', as Breytenbach once described her. The story of Winnie Mandela is a terrible tragedy, and Emma Gilbey has had the sense to tell it straight. As everyone knows, the pretty girl from the Transkei married the charismatic and much older Nelson Mandela just a couple of years before he vanished into 26 years of imprisonment. The young Winnie seems to have assumed that she would deputise for him, but her qualifications to do so were inadequate, as was her character. She was very brave but - this is Ms Gilbey's central point - the police broke her in interrogation in 1969. When she was banished to the Free State in 1977 she was still very brave but by then something had gone wrong: she had been abused beyond the endurance of anyone but a saint. There followed drink and men and money mysteries and a violent temper which, when she returned to Soweto, were to lead to the notorious 'Mandela Soccer Club' and a reign of terror which resulted in her house being burned down by her own people. Then came the kidnapping and murder of 14-year-old 'Stompie', after which she lost most of her remaining sympathy and eventually came to trial. Here was a nightmare for the ANC leaders in exile, let alone for her loving husband-in-prison. ANC leader Oliver Tambo buries his face in his hands: 'What must I do? We can't control her. The ANC can't control her'. Winnie rapidly became a liability to the entire anti-apartheid movement. The South African government would have been thanking the good lord, except that they could hardly risk a long jail sentence when she continued to command the support of the unemployed and uneducated urban youth. In the end, in June 1993, the Appeal Court gave her a suspended sentence. Nelson, out of prison in 1990, left her in 1991, by which time the new generation ANC leadership had taken necessary steps to sideline her. Was it the ANC's own fault? In Ms Gilbeys words, in 1980 'the movement needed a figure within the country who could act cohesively as a symbol to draw the elements of the 'Release Mandela' campaign together. Winnie came to be chosen because in the abstract she was the ideal choice. Here was someone in a tragic situation who was sympathetic and charismatic, who was courageous, outspoken and to top it all was the beautiful wife of their leader. On paper she was perfect. But she was not perfect . . .'   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P2731 Book Publishing.   Types:-  TECH  Products  Product use.  The Financial Times   London Page XXI  "

""Nobody  is going to prevent us from completing our historic mission or  from running the full course -- not those who perpetrate  violence, not those who left us in the lurch at the negotiation  table when we needed them, not those who now want to boycott and  threaten,"" he said.    Addressing the 2,000 delegates to the party's federal  congress at a public meeting at the World Trade Centre in  Kempton Park, Mr de Klerk said there was no turning back. ""We  will keep negotiating, before the election and after the  election. We are prepared to make reasonable adjustments but  will not allow ourselves to be blackmailed.    ""Any attempt to create anarchy will be resisted with all our  might.""    He said the ANC [African National Congress] would cast the  country back into the dark ages. ""It is a party secretly  controlled by communists, militants and extremists. They are  quiet now, but they will shout loudly if the ANC wins control.    ""Mr Mandela jokes that the next president might not come  from  the ANC, but it will be no joke if it is (SA Communist Party  chairman) Mr Joe Slovo or Mrs Winnie Mandela.""    The ANC had spelt out its plans but would not keep its  promises, he said. ""It cannot. It does not know how to and it  has never done so.    ""Mr Mandela and his party are searching for a new species of  flora to finance its promises -- its called the money tree and  banknotes grow on it to pay for the ANC's promises,"" said Mr de  Klerk.    ""I wish the ANC luck in their search, but I don't think  they'll find anything because the money tree and the ANC  Manifesto are both fantasies.    ""Only fools believe in money trees and I do not believe the  South African people are fools.""    He promised the NP would stand by its supporters in the  townships throughout the election campaign. The NP's opponents  should know there were no no-go areas for Mr de Klerk or the NP.  The party's voice would be heard.    The party's message was simply that it could be trusted,  said  Mr de Klerk. ""In the face of the ANC's arrogant belief that it  is going to win, I want to tell Mr Mandela that this is an  election, not a coronation. The people have not yet spoken. The  power is theirs, not yours.""    Other parties wanting to put the ANC in its place should  stop  wasting energy by fighting the NP as well.     "

There are some excellent appointments; some truly  appalling; and many that are just mediocre.    That makes it better than any cabinet this country has seen  before, but leaves us disappointed that Nelson Mandela has not  made the fullest and best use of the large amount of talent  available to him. And there are some choices that are  horrifyingly inappropriate.    The real shock must be the absence of Cyril Ramaphosa.  Mandela has blundered badly by not finding or creating the  right post to make full use of Ramaphosa's talents and  experience in the cabinet.    Notable cabinet selections are:    -- Dullah Omar, justice: A sensible choice, he has extensive  court experience as both a lawyer and attorney. He will now be  in charge of those judges that refused to release him from  detention without trial in a notorious 1980s test case.    -- Joe Slovo, housing: An inspired use of a practical man  with the radical credibility to deal with the huge demands this  ministry will face.    -- Dr Nkosozana Zuma, health: A sound decision. Health  workers say she has experience and a good grasp of health  policy, even though her public image is poor.    -- Joe Modise, defence: The SADF generals may be happy to  have a hawk with a tarnished reputation (for his failure to stop  torture in exile camps), but anyone associated with Umkhonto we  Sizwe [Spear of the Nation; ANC military wing] when he led it  will tell you how poor a choice he is.    -- Sidney Mufamadi, safety and security: An interesting  choice, he has been groomed for the post.    -- Dr Sibusiso Bhengu, education: An unexpected minister.  He has had no involvement in any of the extensive policy and  planning work in this field. As rector of Fort Hare, he had to  leave after falling foul of an internal student conflict.  Mandela probably had in mind that as a Zulu and a former IFP  general secretary, he would help balance the cabinet.    -- Alfred Nzo in foreign affairs is a surprise. There cannot  be a less appropriate choice for such a critical post as this  dour and ineffectual man who was ousted as ANC general secretary.    -- Pallo Jordan, posts, telecommunications and broadcasting:  The natural choice.    -- Mac Maharaj, transport: Has been given a surprisingly  junior post, but at least his talents are in the cabinet.    -- Roelf Meyer, a Nat [National Party] that Mandela can  trust, is a brilliant choice for provincial and constitutional  affairs.    -- Derek Hanekom, land: Will be a relief to anyone concerned  with this issue. He has earned respect for his involvement in  it in recent years, but will face a tough task in his forced  partnership with Kraai van Niekerk, who holds the post of  agricultural minister.    -- Stella Sigcau can only have been chosen for public  enterprises because she is a traditional leader and one of the  few women with cabinet experience, albeit in a homeland where  she was ousted amid corruption charges by Bantu Holomisa, now a  deputy minister.    -- Derek Keys is a wise compromise in finance, particularly  as he is fenced in by the formidable trio of Trevor Manuel in  trade and industry, Jay Naidoo in reconstruction and Alec Erwin  as deputy finance minister.    -- Steve Tshwete was a natural choice for sport.    -- If Mangosuthu Buthelezi had to have a senior post, home  affairs is fairly neutral, though it means he will run future  elections.    It is extraordinary that so important a reconstruction  portfolio as welfare should be in the hands of a Nat with a  dubious reputation, Abe Williams.    -- Artists must be horrified at falling into the combined  hands of the IFP's Ben Ngubane, minister of arts, culture,  science and technology, and deputy minister Winnie Mandela.  They will find themselves caught between a Zulu nationalist and  a woman still under investigation for alleged corruption in the  ANC department of welfare. What a disappointment in the very  week when the president inauguration celebrations, a brilliant  choreographed display of all- inclusive multiculturism, showed  us the power of cultures as a benign, unifying national force.    Some of the more controversial appointments are off-set by  strong deputy ministerships, such as Valli Moosa in provincial  affairs, Aziz Pahad in foreign affairs, and Penuell Manduna in  home affairs. Others -- such as education and welfare -- will  depend on strong appointments to the key posts of  directors-general.    Mandela did reasonably well in negotiating a political,  racial, and geographic balance, but made little attempt to  achieve a gender balance.    He has assembled a team with some strengths, but too many  weaknesses. The pity is that it could have been a dream team.     "

The property it is now  planning to sell will not be able to cover its total debt, which  means it is technically bankrupt. These developments naturally  place a serious question mark over the ANC's ability to control  the country's economy. According to sources within the ANC the  movement has a huge debt to settle. In selling its foreign  assets, the value of which is estimated at 20 million rands,  only part of that debt will be paid. In order to lighten that  debt burden even further the ANC will possibly have to lease  some of its office space at its headquarters, Shell House, in  Johannesburg. Some members even suggested putting the entire  building on the market and then leasing space in the building  for the organization.    One of the projects to which the ANC is paying attention is  the compulsory payment of levies by their officials. An  ordinary ANC MP will apparently have to pay 750 rands per month  to the ANC, while a minister will be asked to pay 2,000 rands.  This technical bankruptcy explains why it was decided to give  such high salaries to politicians. Before the election Mr.  Mandela said that the time for ""fat pigs"" [preceding two words  in English] was over, while it now appears that that time has  only just arrived. If the politicians do not receive those high  salaries then they will not be able to help the ANC out of its  misery.    These salaries are paid by the taxpayer, which means that  the  ANC is indirectly being lifted out of its bankruptcy by the  taxpayer. This is the first scandal to confront the Mandela  government. Meanwhile, a second scandal has also come to light.  Minister of Land Affairs Mr. Derek Hanekom initially indicated  that he was not interested in one of the expensive official cars  because his portfolio only requires a pickup truck for the dirt  roads of the rural areas. Now it appears that his truck is an  expensive imported model costing as much as the official cars,  if not more. With this sort of financial discipline (or rather  the lack of it) the fears of economists for the future of the  country are not unfounded.     "

But delegates signalled a warning for the future by overwhelmingly electing some of the party's most radical figures to the party's national executive committee. On the closing day of the five-day meeting, most of the resolutions up for approval passed with little dissent, but in the voting for the 60 directly elected members to the ANC's ruling body, the top vote-getter was Mr Bantu Holomisa, former military leader of the Transkei homeland currently deputy minister of tourism. Mr Peter Mokaba, former leader of the ANC Youth League, came third, and the controversial Ms Winnie Mandela, the deputy minister of arts and sciences and President Nelson Mandela's estranged wife, came fifth. Along with other prominent ANC members such as Harry Gwala from KwaZulu-Natal and Tony Yengeni from the Western Cape, both also elected to the NEC, these three are generally regarded as the most uncontrollable elements within the party. Despite their grassroots popularity, they were denied senior cabinet posts following the movement's election victory in April because of their loose-cannon reputation. All sitting cabinet members were also elected to the executive body. The positive response to Mr Mandela's closing address, in which he praised the degree of consensus achieved at the conference while promising to guard against corruption in the party and government, reinforced the generally moderate tone of the triennial conference as it concluded business yesterday.

The appeal came in a 21-page memorandum from Mr Pik Botha, South Africa's foreign minister, to Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary general, and the Security Council. Pretoria asked for a UN representative to visit the country urgently to mediate between the government and ANC. Relations between the two sides have fallen to new lows after the Ciskei shooting. Mr Botha warned the government was ready to 'take steps of a coercive nature' to handle violence. UN monitors, deployed as a result of the July visit of UN envoy Cyrus Vance, are to arrive within days. As Mr Botha released the memorandum to the press, the ANC's top policy-making body, the National Working Committee, met for a second day to determine its response to the Ciskei shooting, for which it holds Pretoria responsible. The committee is understood to be split between militants who believe all negotiations with the government should be abandoned, and moderates who argue that negotiation is South Africa's only chance. Winnie Mandela, estranged wife of African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela, has resigned her top posts in the movement because of 'a vicious and malicious' campaign against her, Reuter reports from Johannesburg. In a statement issued late on Wednesday night, Mrs Mandela said she had resigned from the ANC's policy-making national executive committee and its women's league.

AFRICA;    APARTHEID: PRESIDENT DE KLERK MAKES A HISTORIC CONCESSION IN THE BLACK  MAJORITY'S STRUGGLE FOR FREEDOM. THE MOVE IS HAILED AS GREATLY COURAGEOUS.      From Associated Press      CAPE TOWN, South Africa      President Frederik W. de Klerk legalized the African National Congress on  Friday and promised to free Nelson Mandela, a historic concession to the epic  struggle for freedom by the nation's black majority.    Thousands of blacks filled the streets of several cities to celebrate the  announcements by De Klerk in a speech that was widely hailed as courageous.    But black activists and several countries said that despite the move to  legalize the ANC and dozens of other anti-apartheid groups, the white-run  government must now follow through. De Klerk did not act dismantle the  foundation of the apartheid system that would give South Africa's 28 million  blacks a direct voice in running the country.    Activists, white businessmen, liberal politicians and foreign governments  praised the courage of De Klerk, who scrapped many other restrictions on  opposition activity in a bid to draw the ANC into negotiations on South  Africa's future.    ""It's incredible. What he said has certainly taken my breath away,"" said  Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, winner of the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize for his  opposition to apartheid. ""We could say that we are probably seeing history in  the making in South Africa.""    President Bush called the move ""quite positive"" and said he will review U.S.  sanctions on South Africa. An aide said De Klerk and Mandela will be invited to  the White House when the black leader is released.    Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain described De Klerk's announcement  as ""a historic landmark,"" and lifted cultural and academic embargoes.    The exiled ANC said De Klerk's announcements ""go a long way to creating the  climate conducive to negotiations."" But the Zambia-based organization, which  has been fighting a guerrilla war almost 30 years, said more changes were  needed before talks could begin.    If the two sides begin negotiations, quick breakthroughs appear unlikely.    The ANC and all leading anti-apartheid groups demand a one-person, one-vote  democracy, which De Klerk opposes, saying it will result in the 28 million  blacks dominating the 5 million whites.    De Klerk, since taking office in August, has said he envisions some type of  system in which no single racial group would dominate.    Mandela, 71, the country's best-known black leader, would be freed shortly, De  Klerk said. But he said ""personal circumstances and safety"" were among the  factors delaying the release.    ""I want to put it plainly that the government has decided to release Nelson  Mandela unconditionally,"" he said. ""Unfortunately, a further short passage of  time is unavoidable.""    Tutu agreed with De Klerk's assessment, saying, ""There may be people, a lunatic  fringe, who would want to subvert the process by liquidating him. I think that  we have to accept that there are certain constraints.""    De Klerk said he would lift bans on more than 30 outlawed groups and scrap  restrictions on a similar number. He pledged to free most prisoners jailed for  belonging to these groups, declared a moratorium on executions, and lifted most  of the restrictions imposed during a 43-month-old state of emergency.    These were the principal steps demanded by Mandela and the ANC as conditions  for negotiations on a new constitution that would end the black majority's  exclusion from national politics.    ""The season of violence is over. The time for reconstruction and reconciliation  has arrived,"" De Klerk said in his speech, greeted with cheers from supporters  and silence from the right-wing opposition.    De Klerk said his Cabinet unanimously agreed on the decision and the action on  legalizing the groups requires no action from Parliament or any other branch of  government.    Andries Treurnicht, leader of the pro-apartheid Conservative Party, challenged  de Klerk to call an immediate election for white voters to see whether they  backed his decisions.    ""We say he has no mandate for doing the drastic things he intends doing,""  Treurnicht said.    At the perimeter of the parliamentary buildings, about 5,000 demonstrators,  many chanting ""ANC! ANC!"" joined a march demanding Mandela's release.    In Cape Town, Johannesburg and Durban, the three largest cities, thousands of  blacks sang and danced in the streets to celebrate the ANC's legalization.    Police said marchers threw stones at them in Johannesburg and ordered the crowd  to disperse. They then fired tear gas. No arrests or serious injuries were  reported.    The groups to be legalized, in addition to the ANC, include the smaller  Pan-Africanist Congress guerrilla movement, the South African Communist Party  and the United Democratic Front, a nationwide multiracial anti-apartheid  coalition.    The United Democratic Front, which is aligned with the ANC, welcomed De Klerk's  changes but called for sanctions to remain in place.    ""To lift sanctions now would be to run the risk of aborting the process to  democracy,"" it said in a statement.    De Klerk said he was lifting restrictions imposed on 374 activists after their  release from detention.    He said state-of-emergency detentions would be limited to a maximum of six  months and emergency restrictions on the media would be scrapped except for  some unspecified controls over photographic and television coverage of unrest.    Mandela, 71, has been jailed since 1962 and is serving a life sentence for  helping plan the start of the ANC's sabotage and bombing campaign. He has met  with De Klerk, other government officials and anti-apartheid leaders over the  last several months in talks aimed at clearing the way for negotiations.    The ANC was outlawed in 1960 after 48 years of nonviolent campaigning for black  rights. In 1961, it launched its sabotage campaign.    In the last year, the guerrilla campaign has subsided markedly. The ANC's  exiled leadership has acknowledged that its military options were limited and  that it favored negotiations if De Klerk was willing to allow unrestricted  black political activity.

AFRICA;    APARTHEID: PRESIDENT DE KLERK MAKES A HISTORIC CONCESSION IN THE BLACK  MAJORITY'S STRUGGLE FOR FREEDOM. THE MOVE IS HAILED AS GREATLY COURAGEOUS.      From Associated Press      CAPE TOWN, South Africa      President Frederik W. de Klerk legalized the African National Congress on  Friday and promised to free Nelson Mandela, a historic concession to the epic  struggle for freedom by the nation's black majority.    Thousands of blacks filled the streets of several cities to celebrate the  announcements by De Klerk in a speech that was widely hailed as courageous.    But black activists and several countries said that despite the move to  legalize the ANC and dozens of other anti-apartheid groups, the white-run  government must now follow through. De Klerk did not act dismantle the  foundation of the apartheid system that would give South Africa's 28 million  blacks a direct voice in running the country.    Activists, white businessmen, liberal politicians and foreign governments  praised the courage of De Klerk, who scrapped many other restrictions on  opposition activity in a bid to draw the ANC into negotiations on South  Africa's future.    ""It's incredible. What he said has certainly taken my breath away,"" said  Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, winner of the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize for his  opposition to apartheid. ""We could say that we are probably seeing history in  the making in South Africa.""    President Bush called the move ""quite positive"" and said he will review U.S.  sanctions on South Africa. An aide said De Klerk and Mandela will be invited to  the White House when the black leader is released.    Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain described De Klerk's announcement  as ""a historic landmark,"" and lifted cultural and academic embargoes.    The exiled ANC said De Klerk's announcements ""go a long way to creating the  climate conducive to negotiations."" But the Zambia-based organization, which  has been fighting a guerrilla war almost 30 years, said more changes were  needed before talks could begin.    If the two sides begin negotiations, quick breakthroughs appear unlikely.    The ANC and all leading anti-apartheid groups demand a one-person, one-vote  democracy, which De Klerk opposes, saying it will result in the 28 million  blacks dominating the 5 million whites.    De Klerk, since taking office in August, has said he envisions some type of  system in which no single racial group would dominate.    Mandela, 71, the country's best-known black leader, would be freed shortly, De  Klerk said. But he said ""personal circumstances and safety"" were among the  factors delaying the release.    ""I want to put it plainly that the government has decided to release Nelson  Mandela unconditionally,"" he said. ""Unfortunately, a further short passage of  time is unavoidable.""    Tutu agreed with De Klerk's assessment, saying, ""There may be people, a lunatic  fringe, who would want to subvert the process by liquidating him. I think that  we have to accept that there are certain constraints.""    De Klerk said he would lift bans on more than 30 outlawed groups and scrap  restrictions on a similar number. He pledged to free most prisoners jailed for  belonging to these groups, declared a moratorium on executions, and lifted most  of the restrictions imposed during a 43-month-old state of emergency.    These were the principal steps demanded by Mandela and the ANC as conditions  for negotiations on a new constitution that would end the black majority's  exclusion from national politics.    ""The season of violence is over. The time for reconstruction and reconciliation  has arrived,"" De Klerk said in his speech, greeted with cheers from supporters  and silence from the right-wing opposition.    De Klerk said his Cabinet unanimously agreed on the decision and the action on  legalizing the groups requires no action from Parliament or any other branch of  government.    Andries Treurnicht, leader of the pro-apartheid Conservative Party, challenged  de Klerk to call an immediate election for white voters to see whether they  backed his decisions.    ""We say he has no mandate for doing the drastic things he intends doing,""  Treurnicht said.    At the perimeter of the parliamentary buildings, about 5,000 demonstrators,  many chanting ""ANC! ANC!"" joined a march demanding Mandela's release.    In Cape Town, Johannesburg and Durban, the three largest cities, thousands of  blacks sang and danced in the streets to celebrate the ANC's legalization.    Police said marchers threw stones at them in Johannesburg and ordered the crowd  to disperse. They then fired tear gas. No arrests or serious injuries were  reported.    The groups to be legalized, in addition to the ANC, include the smaller  Pan-Africanist Congress guerrilla movement, the South African Communist Party  and the United Democratic Front, a nationwide multiracial anti-apartheid  coalition.    The United Democratic Front, which is aligned with the ANC, welcomed De Klerk's  changes but called for sanctions to remain in place.    ""To lift sanctions now would be to run the risk of aborting the process to  democracy,"" it said in a statement.    De Klerk said he was lifting restrictions imposed on 374 activists after their  release from detention.    He said state-of-emergency detentions would be limited to a maximum of six  months and emergency restrictions on the media would be scrapped except for  some unspecified controls over photographic and television coverage of unrest.    Mandela, 71, has been jailed since 1962 and is serving a life sentence for  helping plan the start of the ANC's sabotage and bombing campaign. He has met  with De Klerk, other government officials and anti-apartheid leaders over the  last several months in talks aimed at clearing the way for negotiations.    The ANC was outlawed in 1960 after 48 years of nonviolent campaigning for black  rights. In 1961, it launched its sabotage campaign.    In the last year, the guerrilla campaign has subsided markedly. The ANC's  exiled leadership has acknowledged that its military options were limited and  that it favored negotiations if De Klerk was willing to allow unrestricted  black political activity.    ""The allegation has been that the government did not wish to talk to them (the  ANC and the Pan-Africanist Congress) and that they are deprived of their right  to normal political activity,"" De Klerk said.    ""The unconditional lifting of the prohibition . . . places everybody in a  position to pursue politics freely,"" he added. ""The justification for violence,  which was always advanced, no longer exists.""

BUT SUDDENLY THE  FOCUS WAS ON MANDELA.      By SCOTT KRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER      SOWETO, South Africa      Jesse Jackson and his 17-member entourage tore across South Africa on a  fact-finding mission for five days last week, delightedly mugging for the  cameras, pressing flesh in the townships, embracing black liberation heroes and  making all the local newspapers.    But Thursday, after spending the days since Sunday in the publicity shadow cast  by black nationalist leader Nelson R. Mandela's return from 27 years in prison,  Jackson cut short his stay in South Africa and flew on to Namibia, leaving some  angry anti-apartheid activists in his wake.    Things began to go awry for the American civil rights leader and former  presidential candidate within minutes of Mandela's release Sunday. As the  71-year-old prisoner walked free, about 50,000 people were gathering on parade  grounds in downtown Cape Town to welcome their leader.    As the spectators, crushed together and kept waiting several hours in a hot  sun, grew increasingly angry with the delay, Jackson's chauffeur-driven sedan  forged into the crowd and attempted to deposit the American in front of the  stage.    Jackson emerged from the car, waved to the crowd and looked up at the City Hall  portico where Mandela was to speak. Seeing no way to climb the platform,  Jackson got back into the car. But the car was penned in by the surging crowd,  many of whom thought it had been carrying Mandela.    Jackson got out again and this time found himself being lifted above the masses  and pulled, his double-breasted suit jacket hanging open, up to the platform.  He escaped into the building and was never asked to speak.    Later that evening, Jackson failed to show up for a reception sponsored by the  U.S. Embassy in his honor and the next day he canceled planned rallies in  Durban and Port Elizabeth, deciding instead to fly to Johannesburg, saying he  had to meet with Mandela.    Mkhuseli Jack, an anti-apartheid leader in Port Elizabeth, said he and the  other rally organizers were ""a little angry and very disappointed.""    ""Ordinary people were looking forward to hearing a man who has stood for human  rights, and the organizations had invested a lot of time in planning for this  visit,"" Jack said.    South Africa had granted Jackson, a strong critic of Pretoria's white  minority-led government, a visa in January. But when he delayed his journey,  government sources said they worried that he was hoping to share the limelight  with Mandela, whose release was widely expected in mid-February.    ""In retrospect, it might have been better if he had come at a more opportune  time,"" Foreign Minister Roelof F. (Pik) Botha said a few days before Mandela's  release. ""I must be honest. I would have liked to have him here in January.""    The reason, Botha said then, was that ""it's not always easy to handle all the  fanfare of some of our American friends. But I understand it. If it's got to be  done, let it then be done. He can come and enjoy the aftermath, but certainly  not claim credit for having been a player on the field.""    During his first few days in South Africa, Jackson was warmly greeted by  enthusiastic crowds. A gold Mercedes-Benz led his motorcade to the black  township of Soweto, where he visited an educational complex and met with civic  leaders. A crowd of several hundred black student nurses from nearby Vista  University cheered his arrival, and he was swamped by reporters and  photographers as he waded into the crowd.    Dozens of ululating women thronged around Jackson as he entered the building,  where he, his wife, Jackie, and son, Jesse Jr., were joined by ANC leader  Walter Sisulu and his wife, Albertina.    ""We didn't know the 'Rev' would be here,"" said Anna, one of the students. ""I  think he's just a great man and I'm very grateful to see him. I just got to  shake his hand!""    On Thursday, Jackson got an audience with Mandela in the freed leader's brick  home in Soweto. Jackson and his family emerged from the hourlong meeting to  face dozens of reporters, most of whom had been waiting for interviews with  Mandela.    Jackson said he wished the late Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. could have ""been  there for that special moment.""    ""It is clear now that Mr. Mandela represents more people in the country than  the state president and represents more people in the world with more  credibility than does the national government,"" Jackson said. ""He is now in the  equation to help define a new South Africa.    ""The misnomer around the world is that Mandela is free,"" Jackson added. ""He is  out of jail, but he's not free. He is not free to live where he wants, not free  to vote and not free to run for office.""    As Jackson flew out of the country, the Star newspaper ran a color photograph  of a smiling Jackson and his wife alongside Nelson and Winnie Mandela.    ""He got what he wanted by coming at this time,"" one diplomat said. ""He did bask  to a certain extent in the Mandela limelight, and the private film crew he  brought with him surely got what they needed.""      Photo, COLOR, Jesse Jackson in Soweto.

The snappy old lady in ""The Sandbox"" may  be simply the butt of an impatient progenitor's bad joke, and ""Happy Days' ""  Winnie may be struggling against much more cataclysmic odds, but in the end  they're both after the same thing: warding off death. Death is death. What's  the difference if it comes as a result of global catastrophe or sly family  imperatives?    The difference is in how we, the audience, perceive the battle. At the Mark  Taper Forum where ""Sandbox"" and ""Happy Days"" constitute Round 2 of the ""50/60  Vision"" festival of ""plays and playwrights that changed the theater"" (there are  6 rounds, totaling 13 plays), it strikes this theatergoer as a cleverly ironic  coupling.    ""Sandbox"" is an inspired curtain-raiser for the longer (though not long) ""Happy  Days."" Albee's 15-minute wonder waltzes across the fourth wall on a whim and  makes confetti of sanctimonious attitudinizing. It is Albee at his best:  winking as he plays God and teases us with the summary dispatching of a tough  old lady.    Grandma (Mary Carver, re-creating a role -- are you ready for this? -- that she  played in the West Coast premiere 29 years ago) is gingerly ""put away"" by her  piously solicitous daughter, known to us only as Mommy (Angela Paton, quaint as  a middle-aged baby with a whim of steel), and her deadpan husband Daddy (Bill  Moor, milquetoast extraordinaire).    The human repository where they dump Grandma is a sandbox, watched over by an  athletic Angel of Death (John Robert Lafleur), while a fifth character, a  musician, performs at the unceremonious event.    Paton, a natural comic, can't resist milking a few of her laughs (or is this  director Michael Arabian's idea?), but otherwise the production sizzles with  preposterousness, made particularly amusing by Carver's sniffing irreverence.    This perfectly sets the stage for the sand heap that has poor Winnie by the  waist (later the throat) in Beckett's ""Happy Days.""    The landscape is apocalyptic this time. Nothing there. Especially no life. And  Winnie (Charlotte Rae) is already waist-deep in encroaching sand. When the  relentless bell wakes her at the start of day, she makes the best of it.  ""Another heavenly day,"" she says, with feeling. Later: ""Begin, Winnie . . .  Begin your day, Winnie,"" is more uncertain as she checks out the landmarks: her  black handbag, her parasol. And we're off on one of Beckett's most majestic,  most enticing, most mysterious and anguishing plays.    Winnie is not quite alone. There is Willie (Moor). Willie, husband or lover,  more dead than alive, but there, behind Winnie's sand heap and still breathing.  At least. Someone to talk to. Willie doesn't always talk back, but he's good  for a grunt now and then and, on especially happy days, good for a word or even  a complete sentence. Once even a song. Oh, happy, happy day.    Winnie is clinging to sanity by going through life's daily rituals, what's left  of them, under the broiling sun. Squeeze out a speck of toothpaste. Brush the  teeth. Read the ""label"" on the toothbrush.    It's something to do.    Check out the contents of the handbag. Bring out the revolver -- that ultimate  reassurance. All must be ordered, parceled out, spooned carefully hour by hour,  each thing in its time, on schedule, on cue, so no gap is left in which to die  of sheer terror. Or silence. Above all, one must fill the dead air with sound;  articulate words; gratitude, often; recite the enduring mercies like a rosary;  like a diamond necklace; the little miracles that fill and force the time.    At the beginning, when Winnie is cheerful and breezy, we laugh.    When Charlotte Rae as Winnie is cheerful and breezy, it is impossible not to  laugh. Is this woman for real? Is this meant to be funny? Oh, yes. Gradually we  listen and learn. Gradually we begin to really hear the play. Winnie, even when  performed by Rae -- especially when performed by Rae? -- is the defiance of the  species. Grace under pressure. Quiet resistance. Winnie against the dying  world.    Because of her association with TV sitcom, casting Rae in the role was risky,  but it was a brilliant stroke. Yes, there were isolated pockets of people at  Friday's performance who still thought that anything that came out of Rae's  mouth had to be just plain hilarious, but fewer and fewer as the play  progressed.    Her cracking voice, her almost foolish matronly squeal occasionally slicing the  air, the very ordinariness of this Winnie -- nobody grand at all here, nobody  messianic -- endow the performance a creeping and ultimately gripping stature.    Director Carey Perloff wisely lets Rae be Rae, and by the time this play is  over, you know this Winnie is as frail and conquerable as the rest of us. But  much, much braver. The hush that fell on the house in the second half, when all  that is left of Winnie is her head, above the sand -- her frightened eyes, her  endless concatenation of words, her unfathomable dignity -- was no accident.

""Another heavenly day,"" she says, with feeling. Later: ""Begin, Winnie . . .  Begin your day, Winnie,"" is more uncertain as she checks out the landmarks: her  black handbag, her parasol. And we're off on one of Beckett's most majestic,  most enticing, most mysterious and anguishing plays.    Winnie is not quite alone. There is Willie (Moor). Willie, husband or lover,  more dead than alive, but there, behind Winnie's sand heap and still breathing.  At least. Someone to talk to. Willie doesn't always talk back, but he's good  for a grunt now and then and, on especially happy days, good for a word or even  a complete sentence. Once even a song. Oh, happy, happy day.    Winnie is clinging to sanity by going through life's daily rituals, what's left  of them, under the broiling sun. Squeeze out a speck of toothpaste. Brush the  teeth. Read the ""label"" on the toothbrush.    It's something to do.    Check out the contents of the handbag. Bring out the revolver -- that ultimate  reassurance. All must be ordered, parceled out, spooned carefully hour by hour,  each thing in its time, on schedule, on cue, so no gap is left in which to die  of sheer terror. Or silence. Above all, one must fill the dead air with sound;  articulate words; gratitude, often; recite the enduring mercies like a rosary;  like a diamond necklace; the little miracles that fill and force the time.    At the beginning, when Winnie is cheerful and breezy, we laugh.    When Charlotte Rae as Winnie is cheerful and breezy, it is impossible not to  laugh. Is this woman for real? Is this meant to be funny? Oh, yes. Gradually we  listen and learn. Gradually we begin to really hear the play. Winnie, even when  performed by Rae -- especially when performed by Rae? -- is the defiance of the  species. Grace under pressure. Quiet resistance. Winnie against the dying  world.    Because of her association with TV sitcom, casting Rae in the role was risky,  but it was a brilliant stroke. Yes, there were isolated pockets of people at  Friday's performance who still thought that anything that came out of Rae's  mouth had to be just plain hilarious, but fewer and fewer as the play  progressed.    Her cracking voice, her almost foolish matronly squeal occasionally slicing the  air, the very ordinariness of this Winnie -- nobody grand at all here, nobody  messianic -- endow the performance a creeping and ultimately gripping stature.    Director Carey Perloff wisely lets Rae be Rae, and by the time this play is  over, you know this Winnie is as frail and conquerable as the rest of us. But  much, much braver. The hush that fell on the house in the second half, when all  that is left of Winnie is her head, above the sand -- her frightened eyes, her  endless concatenation of words, her unfathomable dignity -- was no accident.    Rae had earned it. Bravely.     At the Music Center, 135 N.

0," LA063090-0092   240984    June 30, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition      Part A; Page 1; Column 4; Metro Desk      1901 words      MANDELA GETS STAR'S WELCOME      By TRACY WILKINSON and ANDREA FORD, TIMES STAFF WRITERS      Anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela came to Los Angeles Friday on the last leg  of a taxing eight-city U.S. tour and in a series of addresses asked Hollywood  celebrities and inner-city students alike to keep fighting against white  minority-led rule in South Africa.    In a ceremony on the steps of City Hall, at a glitzy dinner and, finally, at a  late-night '60s-style rally at a packed Coliseum, Mandela thanked Los Angeles  for its ""staunch"" financial and political support in the crusade to end South  Africa's apartheid system.    ""We could not have left the United States without visiting the city which daily  nourished the dreams of millions of people the world over,"" Mandela told an  estimated 70,000 people who filled the Coliseum, many waving fists and chanting  his name. ""Many would know Los Angeles as the unchallenged capital of motion  pictures, many would regard your city as the city of glamour and splendor.    ""We who have suffered and continue to suffer the pain of oppression know that  underneath that face of Los Angeles lies the great and noble spirit of the  citizenry. We who fight for human rights know the depths of the human spirit  running through the hills and valleys of the state of California.""    The reaction of the crowd to Mandela's words was swift and strong.    ""I think this is the most fantastic thing in L.A. history,"" said a euphoric  Victor Jackson. ""L.A. has shown a unity that I didn't think existed. Anytime  you can have this many people out in the fight against apartheid it's  beautiful.""    Sharon Locke, 30, of Culver City, echoed the unity theme.    ""I like the way the people in Los Angels turned out,"" said Locke. ""I think the  unity is contagious. I really feel it.""    Earlier, at a midday ceremony at City Hall, Mandela looked weary but spoke  firmly as he told several thousand people that America's ""unsung heroes"" have  helped to build a ""powerful, broad-based"" movement that is approaching victory  in the struggle against South Africa's policies of racial segregation.    Mandela was hailed by movie stars and Mayor Tom Bradley, who called him a  ""kindred spirit"" of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert Kennedy.    ""In our youth, Hollywood was the stuff of dreams,"" Mandela said on the steps of  City Hall, with actor Gregory Peck presiding over the event. ""In a sense, our  youthful dreams, to some extent, are being realized.""    But, he added, ""We are particularly overjoyed to be in this city because Los  Angeles is a staunch supporter of the anti-apartheid movement.""    In fact, Los Angeles is seen as key to tour organizers' goal of raising  millions of dollars to underwrite social and political work by Mandela's  African National Congress.    An estimated $1.2 million was raised by a reception Friday evening at the  Exposition Park Armory, and 70,000 $10 tickets for a rally at the Los Angeles  Memorial Coliseum were sold -- making it a sellout crowd, organizers said.    Late Friday, tens of thousands of people flocked to the Coliseum -- on foot, in  buses and even in stretch limousines -- to hear rap music, gospel and folk  songs as a prelude to Mandela's second Los Angeles speech. Hundreds of youths,  following behind African drums mounted on a flatbed truck, marched four miles  to the rally.    Scalpers outside tried to hawk tickets for $20 and vendors did a brisk T-shirt  and Mandela-button business.    Turning to the thousands of youth who joined in the Coliseum rally, Mandela  offered an unusually direct and personal message. He said he understood the  ""joy and pain"" of American youth today but warned against using drugs to  ""escape reality.""    ""We learned we could make the future bright by overcoming our own weaknesses  and the weaknesses of others,"" he said. ""It is our common responsibility to  never give up hope. We must all (work) to make the world a better place.""    The crowd gave Mandela a standing ovation.    ""Most people break down in jail, but Mandela outlived a lot of the people who  put him behind bars,"" said Reuben White, 41, of Mandela's 27 years in prison.    ""You must have patience like that to pass the cause on to the children,"" added  White, a communications teacher who brought his 12-year-old son to the Coliseum  rally.    While the Coliseum event was packed, the crowd that assembled earlier for  Mandela's midday address at City Hall was considerably smaller than the throng  of well-wishers that organizers had hoped for.    Los Angeles County Fire Department officials estimated that 4,000 to 5,000  people gathered at City Hall; the police, who first estimated crowd size at  3,000, later revised the figure to about 15,000.    ""How it got from 2,500 at 12:30 to 15,000 (two hours later), I can't explain,""  Los Angeles Police Lt. Fred Nixon said.    Whichever the figure, it fell far short of the 30,000 that organizers were  predicting. When the Dodgers won the World Series in 1988, an estimated 70,000  people crowded City Hall.    City officials and program organizers said they were not overly concerned about  the turnout.    On the political front, the Los Angeles City Council, seizing on Mandela's  visit, voted Friday to close loopholes in a city measure that will keep the  city from doing business with companies that have ties to South Africa.    Mandela, who turns 72 next month, said his 12-day odyssey through the United  States, where he has addressed huge crowds in Harlem, laid a wreath at King's  grave and met with President Bush, has been ""exhausting but exhilarating.""    ""Wherever we went, we were met with the milk of human kindness,"" he said.    ""We believe that the finest tribute we can pay to your wonderful, warm,  generous and compassionate people is to intensify the anti-apartheid struggle  on all fronts,"" Mandela added.    Mandela arrived midday, about two hours late, aboard a chartered Trump Shuttle  which landed at a remote tarmac of the Los Angeles International Airport. He  then sped to City Hall in a motorcade as his security entourage closed the  eastbound lanes of the Santa Monica freeway.    Reaching City Hall, Mandela met briefly with Bradley in private, then emerged  to see the crowd.    Throughout the morning, rumors circulated that concern over Mandela's stamina  would force organizers to pare back the tour.    They considered canceling his last stop, Oakland, but decided to go ahead with  it, a source on the welcoming committee said.    However, his schedule in Los Angeles is being curtailed. According to the  committee source, Mandela's doctor had insisted he skip the City Hall event,  while organizers insisted he appear. In addition to his age and unrelenting  schedule, Mandela recently underwent surgery for the removal of a benign cyst  from his bladder.    Compromise was reached when it was agreed that Mandela would omit a scheduled  speech before the City Council but would appear before the waiting crowd, which  had begun gathering early.    As Mandela moved across a platform outside City Hall, the audience chanted  ""Nelson"" and ""Amandla"" -- the Zulu word for ""power"" -- but then grew impatient  as local politicians took their turns to speak -- finally booing Bradley and  City Council President John Ferraro as each took a turn at the microphone.    In addition to Peck, the star-studded roster of dignitaries included Sidney  Poitier, Dionne Warwick, Robert Guillaume, Cicely Tyson and Muhammad Ali.    But despite the impressive list of luminaries, there was no mistaking the star  of the show.    ""Nothing's going to stop me from getting a snapshot of him -- not even the  FBI,"" vowed Ann Marie Dumas, 21, of Glendale, clutching a disposable camera on  the steps of City Hall. ""I'm gonna blow it up, put it in a frame and hang it in  my living room -- right next to my world map and picture of Martin Luther King  Jr.""    On 1st Street in front of the stage, standing atop a bus shelter, six young men  and a small boy unfurled a blue banner that said, ""Greetings Mandela From the  Homeless.""    Hermine Johnigan, a 64-year-old retired schoolteacher from Los Angeles, had the  privilege of shaking Mandela's hand on the Spring Street steps of City Hall.  She was one of about 50 members off Los Angelenas, a volunteer organization of  women who work with the city protocol office. Wearing yellow dresses, the women  lined the red carpet that Mandela followed up the steps to City Hall.    ""It made me feel very humble. It made me feel very good that I am living in  this century to witness the changes in relations between blacks and whites,""  said Johnigan, who is black.    Johnigan said she firmly grasped Mandela's hand. ""I took both of his hands and  said, 'We've been waiting a long time, God bless you.' And he said, 'Thank  you.' ""    ""I'm not going to wash this hand for a week,"" she said.    The crowd that heard Mandela at City Hall had to deal with rigidly zealous  security guards, blocked-off streets, a poor acoustical system and intense  sunshine -- factors that may have kept people away.    Darlene Donloe, a spokeswoman for the local Mandela Reception Committee, said  she was ""not at all"" disappointed in the crowd size -- one of the smallest  public gatherings of the U.S. tour.    Some organizers said Mandela's late arrival -- after the lunch hour had  concluded -- and rampant rumors he might not go to City Hall until late in the  afternoon may have contributed to the turnout.    Security surrounding Mandela's arrival was tight. Police and State Department  security agents roped off City Hall, inspected the area with bomb-sniffing dogs  and required anyone entering the building to go through a metal detector.    Later, security agents conducted body searches of people arriving at the  Coliseum. But no incidents were reported.    The crowd was fairly subdued until rappers Tone Loc and Ice-T took the stage.  Thousands of fans waved clenched fists and danced at their seats.    Pepe Fernandez, a 65-year-old black Cuban immigrant who attended the rally,  reflected on his civil rights work in Texas during the '50s and '60s.    ""With all the struggles I've seen in the South, I know what it takes for a  black man to succeed,"" Fernandez said. ""There will be a time when people in  this country will realize that the color of a man's skin means nothing.""    Alabama native Charles Smith, 69, sat in his wheelchair at a far end of the  Coliseum.    ""We suffered, but not as much as Mandela,"" Smith said, comparing the old  American South with today's South Africa. ""No one in America can say they  suffered as much as the people in South Africa, as bad as the South was.""    Early in the evening, a small twin-engine plane circled above the Coliseum,  trailing a banner that said, ""Palestinians Welcome Mandela.""    Mandela, who has angered some Jewish groups with his stated support for  Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat, met Friday evening  with Natan Sharansky, the former Refusenik who was jailed for eight years in  the Soviet Union.    Mandela came to Los Angeles from Detroit, where he spoke to about 50,000 people  at Tiger Stadium Thursday night. At dawn Friday, he took a stroll wearing a cap  and jacket from the NBA champion Detroit Pistons.    Asked in Detroit about his health, Mandela said he felt fine, flashing two  thumbs-up signs.    ""If you want to test this, just bring some boxing gloves,"" he told reporters.    Times staff writers Darrell Dawsey, Jane Fritsch, Scott Kraft, Louis Sahagun,  Faye Fiore, Marc Lacey, Hector Tobar, John Lee and Chris Willman contributed to  this report.

0,FT911-286 ,"FT911-286 _AN-BEMAUACTFT 910513   FT  13 MAY 91 / S Africa squatter camp attack claims 27 lives      By PATTI WALDMEIR      JOHANNESBURG   AT LEAST 27 people were killed yesterday in an attack on a squatter camp near Johannesburg, despite last week's outline agreement between the African National Congress (ANC) and the South African government on steps to end violence in the townships. Squatters said their attackers, Zulu inhabitants of the local hostel in the township of Kagiso, were armed with spears and other sharp instruments. At the insistence of Zulu Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, spears were omitted from a list of weapons banned last week by the South African authorities. The ANC is demanding that the carrying of spears be illegal, and has said it will pull out of talks on the country's political future unless this demand is met. The ANC has given the government until Thursday to comply with this demand, while its national executive will meet later today to consider the rest of the outline agreement reached last week with Pretoria. This involved the banning of all so-called 'traditional weapons' apart from spears and sticks, the phasing-out of single-sex hostels and the prohibition of the use of live ammunition by police for crowd control. That agreement was reached between Mr Nelson Mandela, the ANC deputy president, and Mr FW de Klerk, the president, assisted by a handful of advisers. ANC officials stress that it could still be rejected by the organisation's national executive, triggering an earlier threat by the ANC to withdraw from talks. Mr Mandela said in an interview published in the Johannesburg Sunday Times that he was 'optimistic that we would be able to save the peace process'. However, he stressed that they would pull out of talks unless the government met every demand in its recent seven-point ultimatum, which included the issues addressed in last week's talks. Meanwhile, South African police opened fire early on Saturday morning on a group of right-wing whites who attacked a squatter camp in the western Transvaal. It was the first time in decades that police had fired on whites, and two white farmers were injured. The whites had attacked a group of blacks who had re-occupied land from which they were forcibly removed 13 years ago.

0,FT932-14306 ,"FT932-14306 _AN-DDTCVABHFT 930420   FT  20 APR 93 / ANC struggles to control its radicals: Leadership's problems are legion      By PATTI WALDMEIR   WHEN AN obscure leader of the black supremacist Pan-Africanist Congress in South Africa gets more applause at a rally than Mr Nelson Mandela himself - as happened last week in Soweto - the African National Congress knows it has something to worry about. The murder of Mr Chris Hani, whose funeral yesterday ranked as one of the most important political events in South African history, has seriously threatened the always fragile unity of the ANC. It has jeopardised the ascendency of moderate ANC leaders who have brought South Africa to the brink of agreement with the government on a post-apartheid constitution and forced them to adopt militant rhetoric and tactics to please angry supporters. It has also jeopardised relations with the ruling National party, destined to be the ANC's coalition partner in any multi-party interim government. Inevitably, moderate leaders such as Mr Mandela, Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, secretary general, and much of the top ANC leadership, have grown away from their mass base as they have moved towards power-sharing with whites. (The maverick Mrs Winnie Mandela says they show indecent haste to sleep between 'the silken sheets of power.' She has been encouraging ANC crowds to 'kill the Boers, kill the farmers.') Links between the moderate leaders and the radical youth, the unemployed, with the huge underclass, are tenuous at best. Mr Hani's death raises the risk that the ANC leadership will lose control of that radical constituency, either to the black power-inspired PAC, or to chaos itself. The PAC so far has negligible support, despite the symbolic applause at the Soweto rally; but chaos decidedly beckons. 'Chris Hani was the umbilical cord between the African National Congress and the masses,' says Mr Peter Mokaba, leader of the ANC youth league. As general secretary of the South African Communist Party, which operates as a sort of 'Militant Tendency' within the ANC, Mr Hani provided a radical home for the 'young lions' of the townships while ensuring their electoral support for the ANC. His death has thrown up two potential successors, men with the radical credentials - and some of the charm and intelligence - to recreate that vital link. They are Mr Sam Shilowa, deputy general secretary of the Congress of South African Trade Unions, the over one-million-strong ANC-allied union federation, and Mr Tokyo Sexwale, another former guerrilla commander who is leader of the ANC in the crucial industrial heartland around Johannesburg and Pretoria. Neither yet has the stature of Mr Hani, though both have skilfully handled the huge crowds which have turned out to mourn the slain leader. So the main task of defusing the radical threat has inevitably fallen to the ANC leadership - at a time when, after three years of superficially fruitless negotiations with the government, their street credibility is at an all-time low. 'Mandela released three years ago; South Africa still not free.' This complaint, from a placard carried by demonstrators at Saturday's 30,000- strong march through Johannesburg, has become increasingly common as negotiations seem to bog down in ever greater detail. 'The people think that all negotiations have achieved so far is to get Chris Hani killed,' says one moderate ANC leader, stressing that the ANC can no longer afford to ignore popular discontent. 'We want the people to be angry. If they were not, we would know they had given us up,' says Mr Sexwale. 'Now we have to see how we are going to channel this anger properly.' That seems to be the strategy behind the ANC's call for a six-week programme of mass protest action to follow yesterday's funeral. Mass action is meant to defuse that anger - damming it up, says Mr Joe Slovo, leading ANC negotiator, would be 'the shortest route to an explosion' - while applying pressure to speed negotiations. The risk is that a sustained campaign of mass action would tip the delicate balance within the ANC away from 'realists' such as Mr Ramaphosa and Mr Slovo towards the romantic revolutionaries, ideological purists and firebrand socialists who make up the radical camp. This would reverse the balance of power which has prevailed for the past seven months, since the radical-inspired ANC march on the Ciskei capital Bisho, in which more than two dozen died. Moderate ANC leaders, led by Mr Ramaphosa, took control after the blood-letting at Bisho, and were not seriously challenged until Mr Hani's death. In those seven months, they managed to force through the most momentous policy shift in ANC history when they endorsed multi-racial power-sharing until the end of the century, a decision which broke the logjam in constitutional talks with the ruling National party and will form the basis of an eventual deal. Mr Mandela cleverly put down a revolt over this issue, allowing the radicals to hang themselves with their own rope after they were unable to propose any pragmatic alternative to power-sharing. The test he now faces is far greater: to lead his angry people to a level-headed constitutional deal, rather than letting their rage tip South Africa into chaos and race war.

He was on an election road show stop at the Kanhym feeder  farm outside Middelburg where he addressed an audience of a  1,000, two thirds of them black.    He was welcomed in jamboree style with a four-piece band,  singalongs and viva shouts along with a constant drone of boos  from an apparently ANC supporting section of the audience.    Mr de Klerk told his audience South Africa had changed under  the transition process initiated by the NP [National Party].  ""Now it is the ANC who tells you you may not buy there, you may  not walk here and you may not go to that meeting.""    He warned the ANC was not to be trusted and would become a  suppressing party. ""Mr Mandela recently claimed ours is a lame  duck government. But this party is a very alive duck swimming  to a win. It is the ANC that is way down in the water as a lame  duck carrying the weight of the South African Communist Party  [SACP] and all the failures of communism across the world.""    The ANC list of political candidates carried names of failed  politicians such as Nelson Ramodike and Prince James Mahlangu  who had wrecked their respective homelands of Lebowa and  kwaNdebele with maladministration. ""They are way down on the  list along with Winnie Mandela... Let me say no more.""    Mr de Klerk was supported throughout with shouts of viva.  The group which booed fell silent towards the end of the  meeting when he referred to the ANC's economic policies and  specifically to Mozambique as an example of such policies. ""The  world is divided into a rich half and a poor half,"" he said.  ""The poor half of the world is where the policies of communism  and Marxism have been applied -- where the policies of the ANC  have been applied."" ""Just look at Mozambique where everybody  has been made poor, jobs have been lost and the country has  retrogressed."" ""South Africa looks much better. And what  party's policy was applied? -- the NP's"".    The NP stood for one man, one job and for economic growth,  but the ANC was introducing aspects of SACP and Cosatu [Congress  of South African Trade Unions] policies to satisfy them and this  would make all South Africans poorer and frighten off  international investors.

0,FT942-10183 ,"FT942-10183 _AN-EELCZAA1FT 940512   FT  12 MAY 94 / Buthelezi gets home affairs portfolio      By MARK SUZMAN and GORDON CRAMB      JOHANNESBURG   Mr Nelson Mandela, South Africa's new president, yesterday named Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, his main black political rival, to an influential post in his government of national unity. The move lends substance to the call for political reconciliation he made at his inauguration on Tuesday. Chief Buthelezi accepted the post of home affairs minister, a portfolio which is likely to give him authority over a large part of the civil service. However, control over the country's police force and other security services has been retained by Mr Mandela's African National Congress, which would also be expected to monitor closely the chief's ministerial decision - making. The appointment of Chief Buthelezi is one of three full ministerial positions allocated to his Inkatha Freedom party, which decided to participate in South Africa's first all-race elections only 10 days before polling started last month. The other two Inaktha portfolios will be arts and sciences, and correctional services. Under the country's interim constitution agreed after multi-party talks last year in which Chief Buthelezi did not participate, all parties which won more than 5 per cent of the vote were entitled to cabinet representation. Cabinet posts yesterday also went to six members of the new parliament from the National party of Mr F W de Klerk, who will serve as second vice-president. As expected, the respected Mr Derek Keys retains the finance ministry, a decision on which local equity and currency markets had been counting. His deputy will be Mr Alec Erwin, an influential white economist in the ANC who has been closely associated with the party's planned reconstruction and development programme. Mr Pik Botha, the veteran foreign minister, moves to mineral and energy affairs following the appointment last Friday of Mr Alfred Nzo to his former post. Mr Roelf Meyer, the National party's chief negotiator in the tortuous constitutional talks, becomes minister for provincial affairs and constitutional development. One surprise appointment was that of Mrs Winnie Mandela, President Mandela's estranged wife who is head of the ANC's Women's League and has a strong following among radical ANC youth. Mrs Mandela becomes deputy minister for the arts and sciences. Another was the choice as deputy environment minister of General Bantu Holomisa, military ruler of the disbanded Transkei 'homeland' where he retains a power base among the rural poor. Although neither portfolio in itself carries much power, the appointments are seen as an attempt to prevent the two from becoming destabilising forces within the party. However, one of Mrs Mandela's allies, Mr Peter Mokaba, former leader of the ANC youth league who had been widely tipped to be given the tourism portfolio, was left out of the cabinet. Instead that job will go to Mr Trevor Manuel in addition to his previously announced responsibilities as trade and industry minister.   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.

Perhaps most influential among the juggler's assistants was  Mandela's own organisation, with the ANC's highest body, the  National Working Committee [NWC], insisting on retaining control  over several key portfolios despite massive pressure from the  National Party and Inkatha for him to relinquish them.    Among the cabinet positions the ANC was determined to hang  on  to were those related to security, including the defence,  police, and justice ministries, and land, key to the party's  reconstruction development programme.    ANC members have also been named as deputies in key  ministries the party relinquished to their coalition partners.  Said one cabinet insider: ""We have a watchman in any ministry  with relevance to the future."" ""Watchmen"" include trade union  heavyweight Alec Erwin as deputy finance minister to the Nat's  [National Party, NP] Derek Keys, ANC legal advisor Penuell  Maduna as deputy to Home Affairs Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi,  Valli Moosa at Provincial Affairs under Roelf Meyer, which will  be key in the development of the federal system, and Thoko Msane  at Agriculture, which is headed by the Nat's Kraai van Niekerk.    The ANC can expect to install a second level of ""watchmen""  when the directors general are appointed. These could include  Cheryl Carolus at welfare, and John Samuel at education.  Lawyer Nicholas ""Fink"" Haysom was reportedly offered the top  South African Police position, but turned it down in favour of a  counsellor's post in the President's office.    The appointments of Winnie Mandela and Bantu Holomisa as  deputies in the education and environment ministries  respectively relates directly to their standing in the ANC.  Mandela appears to have found it impossible to ignore their  popular followings. Buthelezi's appointment to the Home Affairs  ministry -- formerly Interior -- was criticised by Inkatha  spokesman Ziba Jiyane as ""the only substantial ministry we got"".  He said Buthelezi ""was very hesitant right up to the last  moment"", but had told colleagues they could take cabinet  positions if they wanted to.    Buthelezi had argued in Inkatha for an opposition role,  saying the ANC would use the cabinet as a ""rubber stamp"" for its  own policies, ""messing up the country"" and then holding everyone  responsible. But the opposite view that it was ""important to  have a foothold in decision making on things that affect people  on the ground"" prevailed, said Jiyane.    Although the Home Affairs Ministry is regarded as a very  senior portfolio and Buthelezi's appointment is a clear sign  that Mandela intends to continue with his policy of national  reconciliation, ANC insiders insisted the Inkatha chief would  not be allowed to run future elections. Although this function  has traditionally resided within the Interior Ministry, several  senior sources said a permanent independent electoral commission  would be established.    The NP argued strongly for the defence, correctional  services, justice, and police portfolios, saying the appointment  of one or more senior Nats who enjoyed the trust of the security  forces would smooth the transition. But the ANC's top committee  was unwilling to relinquish the ministries, arguing that the  NP's human rights record made it impossible to give them the  justice portfolio.    Similarly, reservations surfaced on the Nats' willingness to  root out the ""third force"" inside the security forces. ""They  want the security forces to know right away who is boss,"" said  one Nat source.    Added to the equation was the ANC's intention of leaving  General Johan van der Merwe in charge of the police and General  George Meiring at the head of the military for the time being.  They are seen as powerful leadership figures, particularly for  white members of the security forces who need to be led gently  to integration and transformation.    Balance required ANC people to head these ministries as long  as the old guard stayed in uniform, argued the NWC.    While Sydney Mufamadi's appointment to head the law and  order  ministry -- renamed ""safety and security"" -- was almost  universally welcomed within the SAP [South African Police] and  the ANC, former MK [Umkhonto we Sizwe -- spear of the nation,  ANC military wing] commander Joe Modise's nomination to the  defence portfolio was more controversial.    Senior SANDF [South African National Defense Force] officers  made their preference for Modise clear, but ANC members have  criticised his endorsement of the generals' demands for an end  to defence cuts. He has also not fully lived down criticism of  his failure to prevent human rights abuses in MK camps in Angola  in the 1980s.    But Modise enjoys the loyalty of the MK hierarchy, many of  whom can expect to take senior uniformed and defence ministry  positions in the near future.    His conduct of the integration negotiations and TEC  [Transitional Executive Council] defence subcouncil have been  positively received.    The appointment of Inkatha's Joe Matthews as deputy minister  of safety and security is both a concession to Buthelezi and a  calculated strategy by Mandela, who is keen to show the kwaZulu  Police that their long-term interests are best served by  integration into South Africa's future security establishment.  A former ANC member, Matthews is seen as intelligent and  flexible, and ANC security experts believe it will be possible  to establish a good working relationship with him.    The ANC's insistence on retaining the main security  portfolios -- correctional services ultimately went to Inkatha's  Sipho Mzimela -- cost constitutional affairs expert Kader Asmal  a key position as provincial affairs minister. The portfolio,  vital to shaping the federal relationship between central and  regional government, went to the NP's Roelf Meyer in return for  Nat acquiescence on the security ministries.    The land portfolio was almost lost to the ANC when the NP  insisted on heading the agriculture ministry, which has  traditionally included land matters.    Mandela was reportedly preparing to withdraw his nomination  of Derek Hanekom last Friday when the NWC stepped in. Saying  the ANC was the only party with a coherent policy on land, and  pointing to its central importance for the party's  reconstruction and development programme, several NWC members  insisted on splitting land and agriculture.    Hanekom's nomination to the portfolio was also contentious,  with some arguing that a ministry responsible for the emotive  issues of resettlement, land redistribution and compensation  should go to a black. Former ANC Women's League general  secretary Baleka Kgositsile as mentioned as a possible minister.    Although regarded as a political heavyweight, Kgositsile was  felt to lack experience in land issues. Hanekom, whose  expertise and struggle credentials are unquestioned, was  championed by several NWC members. ""Competence won out over  political correctness,"" said one participant.    Inkatha is understood to have had its eye on at least one  senior security position as well as health and housing. The two  departments are key to improving basic living conditions, and  represent areas in which there is potentially much political hay  to be made in the runup to the 1999 election.    Recognising their importance, Mandela stuck to his original  choices of Joe Slovo for housing and Dr Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma  for Health.     "

By SCOTT KRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER      SOWETO, South Africa      Nelson R. Mandela, the inspirational leader of the black rebellion against  apartheid, has become during more than 27 years in prison a figure of almost  mythic proportions among South Africa's black masses, millions of whom have  never heard or seen him.    The name Mandela is a rallying cry for black youths born years after he was  sent to prison. ""Mandela is with us!"" say the graffiti painted on the walls of  South Africa's black urban ghettos.    His picture appears on clandestinely printed anti-apartheid pamphlets, posters  and banners. Songs are sung and poems written about him in the urban black  townships, and children are named for him even in the most remote villages.    ""He is the symbol of our people,"" Archbishop Desmond M. Tutu, the 1984 Nobel  Peace Prize winner, has said. ""His imprisonment represents our oppression. His  self-sacrifice is what we would all like to be in resisting that oppression.  His release has come to symbolize the liberation that we are longing for.""    Since he was arrested in 1962, convicted and sentenced to life after one of the  longest and most important trials in South African history, Mandela has become  the primary unifying force in the deeply divided politics of South Africa's 27  million blacks.    Opinion surveys of urban blacks have shown again and again that he is more  widely accepted than any other leader. Even rivals of Mandela's African  National Congress, the principal guerrilla group fighting white minority-led  rule, have not dared to criticize him.    Black leaders, such as Zulu Chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi, who split with  the ANC more than 30 years ago, have repeatedly told the government that  without Mandela, they will not enter negotiations to share political power with  whites.    ""No black leader worthy of the name will negotiate while Mr. Mandela and his  colleagues are in jail,"" Oscar Dhlomo, a Cabinet minister in Buthelezi's  Kwazulu homeland government, said after talks between moderate blacks and the  white minority-led government fell apart last May.    ""He is the only black leader still able to reach across the ideological divide  in black politics,"" Dhlomo added. ""His years in jail have molded him into an  astute and impartial elder statesman who can play a decisive role in capturing  black unity.""    Mandela's refusal to compromise his principles has given him an unprecedented  stature in South Africa.    His life was at stake when, charged with sabotage and attempting to overthrow  the government -- capital crimes under South Africa's security laws -- he  admitted leadership of the ANC's armed struggle and argued that the country's  minority white government had given the black majority no option but violence  to achieve equality.    Over the past decade, as international pressure has grown on the government to  release him, Mandela rejected many government proposals that would have brought  his release. He refused three times to accept banishment to Transkei, the  nominally independent region of South Africa where he was born. He rejected  exile, though he could have rejoined the ANC leadership at its headquarters in  Lusaka, Zambia.    And time and again, he has refused to forswear violence in the campaign against  apartheid, because it would have meant backing away from the armed struggle  that he started as commander of Umkhonto we Sizwe, or Spear of the Nation, the  military wing of the outlawed ANC.    As Mandela pointed out at his trial, the ANC only reluctantly took up arms  because 50 years of peaceful protest had failed to persuade the white  authorities to remove apartheid and grant blacks equal rights.    ""Only free men can negotiate,"" Mandela declared in February, 1985, in rejecting  a government offer to free him if he first renounced violence. ""Prisoners  cannot enter into contracts. . . . I cannot and will not give any undertaking  at a time when I and you, the people, are not free. Your freedom and mine  cannot be separated. I will return.""    Worldwide pressure on the South African government to release Mandela grew to a  frenzy on July 18, 1988, when Mandela turned 70. A rock concert in London,  televised around the world except in South Africa, was held in his honor.    But the South African government banned all local celebrations and began to  admit privately that it was being held hostage by Mandela's imprisonment.  Release him, they feared, and he might lead a bloody revolution. But let him  die in prison and widespread unrest would be the likely result.    A month later, in August, 1988, Mandela contracted tuberculosis. He was  transferred to a hospital and, after being successfully treated, to a suite in  a private clinic to recuperate.    The country's white leaders, shocked by Mandela's illness, launched an  elaborate plan to demythologize Mandela by ""releasing him in steps,"" as one  government official put it.    The idea was to wash away the mystique that, to a large extent, the government  itself had created by painting Mandela as South Africa's most dangerous  terrorist. Now, the government decided, was the time to show the world that it  was removing Mandela's chains and giving him more freedom.    Fully recovered from his illness three months later, in November, 1988, Mandela  was transferred from the hospital to the Victor Verster Prison Farm in lush  wine country near Paarl, about 40 miles from Cape Town. He was held in a  three-bedroom house usually reserved for prison employees. A white cook and  guard lived in the servants' quarters in the back.    His visitation rules were relaxed and his wife, Winnie, previously restricted  to 40-minute visits once a month, was offered unlimited visiting privileges. At  first, she refused on the grounds that other prisoners were allowed no similar  freedom. But soon Mandela was having lengthy visits, sometimes over lunch or  dinner, with family, friends, current and former political prisoners -- and  even high-level government officials.    In July, 1989, shortly before Mandela's 71st birthday, he met with outgoing  President Pieter W. Botha, at the presidential mansion over tea. The government  called it a ""courtesy call"" and said the two leaders had only discussed  politics in broad terms, with both expressing their desire for peaceful change  in South Africa.    Senior government officials had been meeting extensively with Mandela for  years, but it was the first face-to-face meeting between the president and his  most famous prisoner. It raised hopes in overseas capitals that Mandela's  release, and negotiations between blacks and whites over South Africa's future,  were near.    A week later, though, Mandela, in his first officially sanctioned public  statement since his conviction, said his position had not changed in 28 years  -- that ""the only way of ending violence and bringing peace to our country"" is  for the government to open a ""dialogue with the African National Congress.""    But the government has refused to talk with the ANC until the organization  renounces violence. And the ANC has refused to talk with the government until  Mandela is freed, the state of emergency lifted and bans on anti-apartheid  groups rescinded.    Mandela added that his release ""is not an issue at this stage. . . . I only  would like to contribute to the creation of a climate which would promote peace  in South Africa.""    The government of President Frederik W. de Klerk, elected in September on a  promise to lure blacks to the negotiating table, began to view Mandela as the  key to opening that process.    ""He's someone the government feels it can talk to,"" said a political analyst  privy to the thinking of De Klerk and his Cabinet.    By all accounts, Mandela was instrumental in obtaining the October release of  seven ANC leaders, including Walter Sisulu and four others who had been  convicted with him in 1964. Mandela watched De Klerk announce those releases on  television in his prison living room, surrounded by Sisulu's wife, Albertina,  and three other anti-apartheid leaders.    In December, De Klerk met Mandela for the first time, and the black leader  offered a lengthy policy statement entitled, ""A Document to Create a Climate of  Understanding."" That document, the contents of which remain secret, is under  study by the ANC's exile headquarters.    Mandela's carefully chosen words have long carried special force in South  Africa.    During the trial in which he and seven other leaders of the ANC and the South  African Communist Party were sentenced to life imprisonment, Mandela testified  that he had dedicated his life ""to this struggle of the African people.""    ""I have fought against white domination, and I have fought against black  domination,"" he said then. ""I have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free  society in which all persons live together in harmony and with equal  opportunities. It is an ideal which I hope to live for and to achieve. But if  needs be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die.""    That personal creed has echoed through the intervening years, becoming part of  the political manifesto of South Africa's blacks, and transforming Mandela into  a larger-than-life figure, a Moses who blacks think will lead them to freedom.    He has been honored by the United Nations, European parliaments and human  rights organizations. Universities have bestowed honorary doctorates on him,  cities have named streets and parks after him and past winners of the Nobel  Peace Prize have nominated him for the award. His face even appears on a  postage stamp in Moscow.    Mandela's refusal to compromise has been more than a matter of personal  integrity. The government has tried to persuade blacks to work within the  present political system, accepting advisory roles in the government instead of  a one-person, one-vote system. Mandela's stand has made it possible for others  to campaign not for the reform of racial segregation and white rule but for its  abolition.    ""Many more people might have succumbed to this false promise of gradual change  were it not for his example. Others, but for his counsel, might have rushed  precipitously into revolution that would turn into a racial civil war that no  one wants,"" said Patrick Lekota, a leader of the United Democratic Front who  served five years on a treason conviction that was recently overturned on  appeal.    While on Robben Island, a penal colony off Cape Town and for seven years at  Pollsmoor Prison in the city's suburbs, Mandela trained two generations of  cadres for the African National Congress and reshaped the outlook of scores of  political prisoners, some of whom were ideologically opposed to the ANC.    Those who know Mandela best are confident that upon release, he will at once  rejoin the campaign against apartheid. But they describe him as a practical man  who will also reassure the country's 5 million whites of his commitment to a  nonracial society.    Helen Suzman, 72, a leading liberal member of the white house of Parliament,  has seen Mandela a half-dozen times over the years. After lunch with him at his  prison quarters last summer, she described him as ""an extraordinary man.""    ""As always,"" she said, ""I was impressed by his obvious leadership qualities,  his moderation and his appreciation of the fear of the white minority. His  unconditional release and his presence at the negotiating table is an absolute  prerequisite to"" peace in South Africa.    ""Unlike white people anywhere else in Africa, whites in South Africa belong  here -- this is their home,"" Mandela told Samuel Dash, a law professor and  former chief counsel for the Senate Watergate Committee, four years ago.    But Mandela also made clear his determination to see apartheid ended  completely, not adapted through the government's step-by-step reforms, Dash  wrote in the New York Times Magazine.    ""If white leaders do not act in good faith toward us, if they will not meet  with us to discuss political equality and if, in effect, they tell us we must  remain subjugated by whites, then there is really no alternative other than  violence,"" Mandela told Dash. ""And, I assure you, we will prevail.""    It was the same sense of conviction and reasonableness that he showed in 1964  when he explained why he had turned to sabotage after two decades of nonviolent  protest.    ""I do not deny that I planned sabotage,"" he told the court from the prisoner's  dock. ""I did not plan it in a spirit of recklessness, nor because I have any  love of violence. I planned it as a result of a calm and sober assessment of  the political situation that had arisen after many years of tyranny,  exploitation and oppression of my people by the whites.""    Mandela, born in 1918, was the eldest son of a chief of the Xhosa-speaking  Thembu people in Transkei, and he was raised with the self-assurance of African  royalty in the household of the Thembus' paramount chief.    He studied at South Africa's Fort Hare University, where Zimbabwe's prime  minister, Robert Mugabe, and other leaders of independent black Africa have  studied. He was expelled for helping organize a student strike.    He went to Johannesburg, worked for a time as a mine policeman and clerk,  graduated from the University of the Witwatersrand and then became apprenticed  to a white law firm before he established his own practice with Oliver R.  Tambo, a friend from Fort Hare, who is now the president in exile of the  African National Congress. (He earned a formal law degree in 1989 through  correspondence courses.)    In 1944, Mandela joined the congress, which had been founded in 1912, and with  Tambo and other young men turned it from petitions for redress of blacks'  grievances to protests on a broader scale. When the National Party came to  power in 1948 and began to impose its apartheid policies on the country, the  congress, under Mandela's and Tambo's direction, launched renewed campaigns of  civil disobedience.    Mandela was at first given a suspended sentence for violating the country's  security laws, then was silenced and restricted in his movements by a  government ""banning"" order. Later, he was detained along with 155 others,  charged with treason and, after a four-year trial that ended in 1961, acquitted  along with the other defendants.    The African National Congress was outlawed in the wake of the protests that  followed the fatal police shooting on March 21, 1960, of 69 blacks engaged in  passive resistance at Sharpeville, a black township about 50 miles south of  Johannesburg.    The congress then turned to sabotage and away from its campaigns of passive  resistance that, following the example of India's Mohandas K. Gandhi, were  aimed at pressuring the government to end apartheid and convene an all-race  national convention to write a new constitution.    Mandela was a central figure in this shift, drawing up the plans to establish  the congress underground and becoming the first commander of its military wing.  Sabotage was to be the strategy to disrupt the economy and scare away capital.  But, to avoid loss of life, terrorism, guerrilla war and a full-scale rebellion  were ruled out.    ""There comes a time, as it came in my life,"" he declared at his trial, ""when a  man is denied the right to live a normal life, when he can only live the life  of an outlaw because the government has so decreed to use the law to impose a  state of outlawry upon him. I was driven to this situation, and I do not regret  the decisions that I did take.""    Slipping across the border, Mandela visited Ethiopia, Algeria and other African  countries, arranging military training for congress members and undergoing a  brief training course himself. His secret return to South Africa and his  daredevil underground existence earned him the title of the ""Black Pimpernel""  and added to his romantic image among blacks.    He was caught eventually, sentenced to five years in prison for incitement to  violence and leaving the country illegally. While serving that term, he was  brought back to court, charged with treason and eventually convicted of  sabotage along with most of the Spear of the Nation's high command.    This was to be the temporary end of Mandela and of the African National  Congress. Most of its leaders were in jail or exile, and scores of its  grass-roots members were arrested. Its guerrillas made occasional bomb attacks,  but were usually caught quickly. The underground organization was heavily  infiltrated by the police.    Winnie Mandela, now 54, a social worker by training, took up the cause but was  quickly ""banned"" herself, barred from politics and eventually exiled to the  small farming community of Brandfort in the Orange Free State. She returned to  Soweto in 1985, defying the government's restrictions, and was allowed to stay.    Married 31 years, they lived together for only four months, and for only a few  weeks at a time. For years, they were separated by thick glass when she made  closely supervised visits in prison, unable even to touch. Not until 1984, when  Mandela required surgery for removal of his enlarged prostate gland, did the  whole family get together for the first time since 1962.    Their daughters, Zenani, 30, and Zindziswa, 29, have joined what is now a  family cause, speaking and traveling on behalf of their parents. Mandela also  had three children from his first marriage. One son, Makgatho, 39, runs a  general store in the Transkei homeland, and a daughter, Makaziwe, 35, is  working on a doctorate in anthropology at the University of Massachusetts. One  son died in an auto accident several years ago.    When he was first imprisoned on Robben Island, Mandela spent most of his time  at hard labor, quarrying limestone, but through repeated protests he won  permission to study and garden. In recent years, he has exercised vigorously,  using an exercise bicycle.    With daily newspapers, a radio, television and a steady flow of books and  magazines, Mandela managed in recent years to keep himself fully informed on  developments in South Africa and elsewhere. Until 1988, political discussions  with other black nationalist leaders who were his cellmates were daily fare.    Close friends said that although Mandela enjoyed the large house on the prison  farm, he felt isolated and missed the daily contact of other prisoners, who  were allowed infrequent visits.    Mandela's long incarceration did not, contrary to the expectations of the  government, turn him into a non-person, forgotten by his supporters. Instead,  his leadership image of self-sacrifice and refusal to compromise with apartheid  has been enhanced to the point of legend.

By SCOTT KRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER      SOWETO, South Africa      Nelson R. Mandela, the inspirational leader of the black rebellion against  apartheid, has become during more than 27 years in prison a figure of almost  mythic proportions among South Africa's black masses, millions of whom have  never heard or seen him.    The name Mandela is a rallying cry for black youths born years after he was  sent to prison. ""Mandela is with us!"" say the graffiti painted on the walls of  South Africa's black urban ghettos.    His picture appears on clandestinely printed anti-apartheid pamphlets, posters  and banners. Songs are sung and poems written about him in the urban black  townships, and children are named for him even in the most remote villages.    ""He is the symbol of our people,"" Archbishop Desmond M. Tutu, the 1984 Nobel  Peace Prize winner, has said. ""His imprisonment represents our oppression. His  self-sacrifice is what we would all like to be in resisting that oppression.  His release has come to symbolize the liberation that we are longing for.""    Since he was arrested in 1962, convicted and sentenced to life after one of the  longest and most important trials in South African history, Mandela has become  the primary unifying force in the deeply divided politics of South Africa's 27  million blacks.    Opinion surveys of urban blacks have shown again and again that he is more  widely accepted than any other leader. Even rivals of Mandela's African  National Congress, the principal guerrilla group fighting white minority-led  rule, have not dared to criticize him.    Black leaders, such as Zulu Chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi, who split with  the ANC more than 30 years ago, have repeatedly told the government that  without Mandela, they will not enter negotiations to share political power with  whites.    ""No black leader worthy of the name will negotiate while Mr. Mandela and his  colleagues are in jail,"" Oscar Dhlomo, a Cabinet minister in Buthelezi's  Kwazulu homeland government, said after talks between moderate blacks and the  white minority-led government fell apart last May.    ""He is the only black leader still able to reach across the ideological divide  in black politics,"" Dhlomo added. ""His years in jail have molded him into an  astute and impartial elder statesman who can play a decisive role in capturing  black unity.""    Mandela's refusal to compromise his principles has given him an unprecedented  stature in South Africa.    His life was at stake when, charged with sabotage and attempting to overthrow  the government -- capital crimes under South Africa's security laws -- he  admitted leadership of the ANC's armed struggle and argued that the country's  minority white government had given the black majority no option but violence  to achieve equality.    Over the past decade, as international pressure has grown on the government to  release him, Mandela rejected many government proposals that would have brought  his release. He refused three times to accept banishment to Transkei, the  nominally independent region of South Africa where he was born. He rejected  exile, though he could have rejoined the ANC leadership at its headquarters in  Lusaka, Zambia.    And time and again, he has refused to forswear violence in the campaign against  apartheid, because it would have meant backing away from the armed struggle  that he started as commander of Umkhonto we Sizwe, or Spear of the Nation, the  military wing of the outlawed ANC.    As Mandela pointed out at his trial, the ANC only reluctantly took up arms  because 50 years of peaceful protest had failed to persuade the white  authorities to remove apartheid and grant blacks equal rights.    ""Only free men can negotiate,"" Mandela declared in February, 1985, in rejecting  a government offer to free him if he first renounced violence. ""Prisoners  cannot enter into contracts. . . . I cannot and will not give any undertaking  at a time when I and you, the people, are not free. Your freedom and mine  cannot be separated. I will return.""    Worldwide pressure on the South African government to release Mandela grew to a  frenzy on July 18, 1988, when Mandela turned 70. A rock concert in London,  televised around the world except in South Africa, was held in his honor.    But the South African government banned all local celebrations and began to  admit privately that it was being held hostage by Mandela's imprisonment.  Release him, they feared, and he might lead a bloody revolution. But let him  die in prison and widespread unrest would be the likely result.    A month later, in August, 1988, Mandela contracted tuberculosis. He was  transferred to a hospital and, after being successfully treated, to a suite in  a private clinic to recuperate.    The country's white leaders, shocked by Mandela's illness, launched an  elaborate plan to demythologize Mandela by ""releasing him in steps,"" as one  government official put it.    The idea was to wash away the mystique that, to a large extent, the government  itself had created by painting Mandela as South Africa's most dangerous  terrorist. Now, the government decided, was the time to show the world that it  was removing Mandela's chains and giving him more freedom.    Fully recovered from his illness three months later, in November, 1988, Mandela  was transferred from the hospital to the Victor Verster Prison Farm in lush  wine country near Paarl, about 40 miles from Cape Town. He was held in a  three-bedroom house usually reserved for prison employees. A white cook and  guard lived in the servants' quarters in the back.    His visitation rules were relaxed and his wife, Winnie, previously restricted  to 40-minute visits once a month, was offered unlimited visiting privileges. At  first, she refused on the grounds that other prisoners were allowed no similar  freedom. But soon Mandela was having lengthy visits, sometimes over lunch or  dinner, with family, friends, current and former political prisoners -- and  even high-level government officials.    In July, 1989, shortly before Mandela's 71st birthday, he met with outgoing  President Pieter W. Botha, at the presidential mansion over tea. The government  called it a ""courtesy call"" and said the two leaders had only discussed  politics in broad terms, with both expressing their desire for peaceful change  in South Africa.    Senior government officials had been meeting extensively with Mandela for  years, but it was the first face-to-face meeting between the president and his  most famous prisoner. It raised hopes in overseas capitals that Mandela's  release, and negotiations between blacks and whites over South Africa's future,  were near.    A week later, though, Mandela, in his first officially sanctioned public  statement since his conviction, said his position had not changed in 28 years  -- that ""the only way of ending violence and bringing peace to our country"" is  for the government to open a ""dialogue with the African National Congress.""    But the government has refused to talk with the ANC until the organization  renounces violence. And the ANC has refused to talk with the government until  Mandela is freed, the state of emergency lifted and bans on anti-apartheid  groups rescinded.    Mandela added that his release ""is not an issue at this stage. . . . I only  would like to contribute to the creation of a climate which would promote peace  in South Africa.""    The government of President Frederik W. de Klerk, elected in September on a  promise to lure blacks to the negotiating table, began to view Mandela as the  key to opening that process.

Mandela watched De Klerk announce those releases on  television in his prison living room, surrounded by Sisulu's wife, Albertina,  and three other anti-apartheid leaders.    In December, De Klerk met Mandela for the first time, and the black leader  offered a lengthy policy statement entitled, ""A Document to Create a Climate of  Understanding."" That document, the contents of which remain secret, is under  study by the ANC's exile headquarters.    Mandela's carefully chosen words have long carried special force in South  Africa.    During the trial in which he and seven other leaders of the ANC and the South  African Communist Party were sentenced to life imprisonment, Mandela testified  that he had dedicated his life ""to this struggle of the African people.""    ""I have fought against white domination, and I have fought against black  domination,"" he said then. ""I have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free  society in which all persons live together in harmony and with equal  opportunities. It is an ideal which I hope to live for and to achieve.

Mandela, born in 1918, was the eldest son of a chief of the Xhosa-speaking  Thembu people in Transkei, and he was raised with the self-assurance of African  royalty in the household of the Thembus' paramount chief.    He studied at South Africa's Fort Hare University, where Zimbabwe's prime  minister, Robert Mugabe, and other leaders of independent black Africa have  studied. He was expelled for helping organize a student strike.    He went to Johannesburg, worked for a time as a mine policeman and clerk,  graduated from the University of the Witwatersrand and then became apprenticed  to a white law firm before he established his own practice with Oliver R.

I was driven to this situation, and I do not regret  the decisions that I did take.""    Slipping across the border, Mandela visited Ethiopia, Algeria and other African  countries, arranging military training for congress members and undergoing a  brief training course himself.

Its guerrillas made occasional bomb attacks,  but were usually caught quickly. The underground organization was heavily  infiltrated by the police.    Winnie Mandela, now 54, a social worker by training, took up the cause but was  quickly ""banned"" herself, barred from politics and eventually exiled to the  small farming community of Brandfort in the Orange Free State. She returned to  Soweto in 1985, defying the government's restrictions, and was allowed to stay.    Married 31 years, they lived together for only four months, and for only a few  weeks at a time. For years, they were separated by thick glass when she made  closely supervised visits in prison, unable even to touch. Not until 1984, when  Mandela required surgery for removal of his enlarged prostate gland, did the  whole family get together for the first time since 1962.    Their daughters, Zenani, 30, and Zindziswa, 29, have joined what is now a  family cause, speaking and traveling on behalf of their parents. Mandela also  had three children from his first marriage. One son, Makgatho, 39, runs a  general store in the Transkei homeland, and a daughter, Makaziwe, 35, is  working on a doctorate in anthropology at the University of Massachusetts. One  son died in an auto accident several years ago.    When he was first imprisoned on Robben Island, Mandela spent most of his time  at hard labor, quarrying limestone, but through repeated protests he won  permission to study and garden. In recent years, he has exercised vigorously,  using an exercise bicycle.    With daily newspapers, a radio, television and a steady flow of books and  magazines, Mandela managed in recent years to keep himself fully informed on  developments in South Africa and elsewhere. Until 1988, political discussions  with other black nationalist leaders who were his cellmates were daily fare.    Close friends said that although Mandela enjoyed the large house on the prison  farm, he felt isolated and missed the daily contact of other prisoners, who  were allowed infrequent visits.    Mandela's long incarceration did not, contrary to the expectations of the  government, turn him into a non-person, forgotten by his supporters. Instead,  his leadership image of self-sacrifice and refusal to compromise with apartheid  has been enhanced to the point of legend.

By SCOTT KRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER      SOWETO, South Africa      Nelson R. Mandela, the inspirational leader of the black rebellion against  apartheid, has become during more than 27 years in prison a figure of almost  mythic proportions among South Africa's black masses, millions of whom have  never heard or seen him.    The name Mandela is a rallying cry for black youths born years after he was  sent to prison. ""Mandela is with us!"" say the graffiti painted on the walls of  South Africa's black urban ghettos.    His picture appears on clandestinely printed anti-apartheid pamphlets, posters  and banners. Songs are sung and poems written about him in the urban black  townships, and children are named for him even in the most remote villages.    ""He is the symbol of our people,"" Archbishop Desmond M. Tutu, the 1984 Nobel  Peace Prize winner, has said. ""His imprisonment represents our oppression. His  self-sacrifice is what we would all like to be in resisting that oppression.  His release has come to symbolize the liberation that we are longing for.""    Since he was arrested in 1962, convicted and sentenced to life after one of the  longest and most important trials in South African history, Mandela has become  the primary unifying force in the deeply divided politics of South Africa's 27  million blacks.    Opinion surveys of urban blacks have shown again and again that he is more  widely accepted than any other leader. Even rivals of Mandela's African  National Congress, the principal guerrilla group fighting white minority-led  rule, have not dared to criticize him.    Black leaders, such as Zulu Chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi, who split with  the ANC more than 30 years ago, have repeatedly told the government that  without Mandela, they will not enter negotiations to share political power with  whites.    ""No black leader worthy of the name will negotiate while Mr. Mandela and his  colleagues are in jail,"" Oscar Dhlomo, a Cabinet minister in Buthelezi's  Kwazulu homeland government, said after talks between moderate blacks and the  white minority-led government fell apart last May.    ""He is the only black leader still able to reach across the ideological divide  in black politics,"" Dhlomo added. ""His years in jail have molded him into an  astute and impartial elder statesman who can play a decisive role in capturing  black unity.""    Mandela's refusal to compromise his principles has given him an unprecedented  stature in South Africa.    His life was at stake when, charged with sabotage and attempting to overthrow  the government -- capital crimes under South Africa's security laws -- he  admitted leadership of the ANC's armed struggle and argued that the country's  minority white government had given the black majority no option but violence  to achieve equality.    Over the past decade, as international pressure has grown on the government to  release him, Mandela rejected many government proposals that would have brought  his release. He refused three times to accept banishment to Transkei, the  nominally independent region of South Africa where he was born. He rejected  exile, though he could have rejoined the ANC leadership at its headquarters in  Lusaka, Zambia.    And time and again, he has refused to forswear violence in the campaign against  apartheid, because it would have meant backing away from the armed struggle  that he started as commander of Umkhonto we Sizwe, or Spear of the Nation, the  military wing of the outlawed ANC.    As Mandela pointed out at his trial, the ANC only reluctantly took up arms  because 50 years of peaceful protest had failed to persuade the white  authorities to remove apartheid and grant blacks equal rights.    ""Only free men can negotiate,"" Mandela declared in February, 1985, in rejecting  a government offer to free him if he first renounced violence. ""Prisoners  cannot enter into contracts. . . . I cannot and will not give any undertaking  at a time when I and you, the people, are not free. Your freedom and mine  cannot be separated. I will return.""    Worldwide pressure on the South African government to release Mandela grew to a  frenzy on July 18, 1988, when Mandela turned 70. A rock concert in London,  televised around the world except in South Africa, was held in his honor.    But the South African government banned all local celebrations and began to  admit privately that it was being held hostage by Mandela's imprisonment.  Release him, they feared, and he might lead a bloody revolution. But let him  die in prison and widespread unrest would be the likely result.    A month later, in August, 1988, Mandela contracted tuberculosis. He was  transferred to a hospital and, after being successfully treated, to a suite in  a private clinic to recuperate.    The country's white leaders, shocked by Mandela's illness, launched an  elaborate plan to demythologize Mandela by ""releasing him in steps,"" as one  government official put it.    The idea was to wash away the mystique that, to a large extent, the government  itself had created by painting Mandela as South Africa's most dangerous  terrorist. Now, the government decided, was the time to show the world that it  was removing Mandela's chains and giving him more freedom.    Fully recovered from his illness three months later, in November, 1988, Mandela  was transferred from the hospital to the Victor Verster Prison Farm in lush  wine country near Paarl, about 40 miles from Cape Town. He was held in a  three-bedroom house usually reserved for prison employees. A white cook and  guard lived in the servants' quarters in the back.    His visitation rules were relaxed and his wife, Winnie, previously restricted  to 40-minute visits once a month, was offered unlimited visiting privileges. At  first, she refused on the grounds that other prisoners were allowed no similar  freedom. But soon Mandela was having lengthy visits, sometimes over lunch or  dinner, with family, friends, current and former political prisoners -- and  even high-level government officials.    In July, 1989, shortly before Mandela's 71st birthday, he met with outgoing  President Pieter W. Botha, at the presidential mansion over tea. The government  called it a ""courtesy call"" and said the two leaders had only discussed  politics in broad terms, with both expressing their desire for peaceful change  in South Africa.    Senior government officials had been meeting extensively with Mandela for  years, but it was the first face-to-face meeting between the president and his  most famous prisoner. It raised hopes in overseas capitals that Mandela's  release, and negotiations between blacks and whites over South Africa's future,  were near.    A week later, though, Mandela, in his first officially sanctioned public  statement since his conviction, said his position had not changed in 28 years  -- that ""the only way of ending violence and bringing peace to our country"" is  for the government to open a ""dialogue with the African National Congress.""    But the government has refused to talk with the ANC until the organization  renounces violence. And the ANC has refused to talk with the government until  Mandela is freed, the state of emergency lifted and bans on anti-apartheid  groups rescinded.    Mandela added that his release ""is not an issue at this stage. . . . I only  would like to contribute to the creation of a climate which would promote peace  in South Africa.""    The government of President Frederik W. de Klerk, elected in September on a  promise to lure blacks to the negotiating table, began to view Mandela as the  key to opening that process.    ""He's someone the government feels it can talk to,"" said a political analyst  privy to the thinking of De Klerk and his Cabinet.    By all accounts, Mandela was instrumental in obtaining the October release of  seven ANC leaders, including Walter Sisulu and four others who had been  convicted with him in 1964. Mandela watched De Klerk announce those releases on  television in his prison living room, surrounded by Sisulu's wife, Albertina,  and three other anti-apartheid leaders.    In December, De Klerk met Mandela for the first time, and the black leader  offered a lengthy policy statement entitled, ""A Document to Create a Climate of  Understanding."" That document, the contents of which remain secret, is under  study by the ANC's exile headquarters.    Mandela's carefully chosen words have long carried special force in South  Africa.    During the trial in which he and seven other leaders of the ANC and the South  African Communist Party were sentenced to life imprisonment, Mandela testified  that he had dedicated his life ""to this struggle of the African people.""    ""I have fought against white domination, and I have fought against black  domination,"" he said then. ""I have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free  society in which all persons live together in harmony and with equal  opportunities. It is an ideal which I hope to live for and to achieve. But if  needs be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die.""    That personal creed has echoed through the intervening years, becoming part of  the political manifesto of South Africa's blacks, and transforming Mandela into  a larger-than-life figure, a Moses who blacks think will lead them to freedom.    He has been honored by the United Nations, European parliaments and human  rights organizations. Universities have bestowed honorary doctorates on him,  cities have named streets and parks after him and past winners of the Nobel  Peace Prize have nominated him for the award. His face even appears on a  postage stamp in Moscow.    Mandela's refusal to compromise has been more than a matter of personal  integrity. The government has tried to persuade blacks to work within the  present political system, accepting advisory roles in the government instead of  a one-person, one-vote system. Mandela's stand has made it possible for others  to campaign not for the reform of racial segregation and white rule but for its  abolition.    ""Many more people might have succumbed to this false promise of gradual change  were it not for his example. Others, but for his counsel, might have rushed  precipitously into revolution that would turn into a racial civil war that no  one wants,"" said Patrick Lekota, a leader of the United Democratic Front who  served five years on a treason conviction that was recently overturned on  appeal.    While on Robben Island, a penal colony off Cape Town and for seven years at  Pollsmoor Prison in the city's suburbs, Mandela trained two generations of  cadres for the African National Congress and reshaped the outlook of scores of  political prisoners, some of whom were ideologically opposed to the ANC.    Those who know Mandela best are confident that upon release, he will at once  rejoin the campaign against apartheid. But they describe him as a practical man  who will also reassure the country's 5 million whites of his commitment to a  nonracial society.    Helen Suzman, 72, a leading liberal member of the white house of Parliament,  has seen Mandela a half-dozen times over the years. After lunch with him at his  prison quarters last summer, she described him as ""an extraordinary man.""    ""As always,"" she said, ""I was impressed by his obvious leadership qualities,  his moderation and his appreciation of the fear of the white minority. His  unconditional release and his presence at the negotiating table is an absolute  prerequisite to"" peace in South Africa.    ""Unlike white people anywhere else in Africa, whites in South Africa belong  here -- this is their home,"" Mandela told Samuel Dash, a law professor and  former chief counsel for the Senate Watergate Committee, four years ago.    But Mandela also made clear his determination to see apartheid ended  completely, not adapted through the government's step-by-step reforms, Dash  wrote in the New York Times Magazine.    ""If white leaders do not act in good faith toward us, if they will not meet  with us to discuss political equality and if, in effect, they tell us we must  remain subjugated by whites, then there is really no alternative other than  violence,"" Mandela told Dash. ""And, I assure you, we will prevail.""    It was the same sense of conviction and reasonableness that he showed in 1964  when he explained why he had turned to sabotage after two decades of nonviolent  protest.    ""I do not deny that I planned sabotage,"" he told the court from the prisoner's  dock. ""I did not plan it in a spirit of recklessness, nor because I have any  love of violence. I planned it as a result of a calm and sober assessment of  the political situation that had arisen after many years of tyranny,  exploitation and oppression of my people by the whites.""    Mandela, born in 1918, was the eldest son of a chief of the Xhosa-speaking  Thembu people in Transkei, and he was raised with the self-assurance of African  royalty in the household of the Thembus' paramount chief.    He studied at South Africa's Fort Hare University, where Zimbabwe's prime  minister, Robert Mugabe, and other leaders of independent black Africa have  studied. He was expelled for helping organize a student strike.    He went to Johannesburg, worked for a time as a mine policeman and clerk,  graduated from the University of the Witwatersrand and then became apprenticed  to a white law firm before he established his own practice with Oliver R.  Tambo, a friend from Fort Hare, who is now the president in exile of the  African National Congress. (He earned a formal law degree in 1989 through  correspondence courses.)    In 1944, Mandela joined the congress, which had been founded in 1912, and with  Tambo and other young men turned it from petitions for redress of blacks'  grievances to protests on a broader scale. When the National Party came to  power in 1948 and began to impose its apartheid policies on the country, the  congress, under Mandela's and Tambo's direction, launched renewed campaigns of  civil disobedience.    Mandela was at first given a suspended sentence for violating the country's  security laws, then was silenced and restricted in his movements by a  government ""banning"" order. Later, he was detained along with 155 others,  charged with treason and, after a four-year trial that ended in 1961, acquitted  along with the other defendants.    The African National Congress was outlawed in the wake of the protests that  followed the fatal police shooting on March 21, 1960, of 69 blacks engaged in  passive resistance at Sharpeville, a black township about 50 miles south of  Johannesburg.    The congress then turned to sabotage and away from its campaigns of passive  resistance that, following the example of India's Mohandas K. Gandhi, were  aimed at pressuring the government to end apartheid and convene an all-race  national convention to write a new constitution.    Mandela was a central figure in this shift, drawing up the plans to establish  the congress underground and becoming the first commander of its military wing.  Sabotage was to be the strategy to disrupt the economy and scare away capital.  But, to avoid loss of life, terrorism, guerrilla war and a full-scale rebellion  were ruled out.    ""There comes a time, as it came in my life,"" he declared at his trial, ""when a  man is denied the right to live a normal life, when he can only live the life  of an outlaw because the government has so decreed to use the law to impose a  state of outlawry upon him. I was driven to this situation, and I do not regret  the decisions that I did take.""    Slipping across the border, Mandela visited Ethiopia, Algeria and other African  countries, arranging military training for congress members and undergoing a  brief training course himself. His secret return to South Africa and his  daredevil underground existence earned him the title of the ""Black Pimpernel""  and added to his romantic image among blacks.    He was caught eventually, sentenced to five years in prison for incitement to  violence and leaving the country illegally. While serving that term, he was  brought back to court, charged with treason and eventually convicted of  sabotage along with most of the Spear of the Nation's high command.    This was to be the temporary end of Mandela and of the African National  Congress. Most of its leaders were in jail or exile, and scores of its  grass-roots members were arrested. Its guerrillas made occasional bomb attacks,  but were usually caught quickly. The underground organization was heavily  infiltrated by the police.    Winnie Mandela, now 54, a social worker by training, took up the cause but was  quickly ""banned"" herself, barred from politics and eventually exiled to the  small farming community of Brandfort in the Orange Free State. She returned to  Soweto in 1985, defying the government's restrictions, and was allowed to stay.    Married 31 years, they lived together for only four months, and for only a few  weeks at a time. For years, they were separated by thick glass when she made  closely supervised visits in prison, unable even to touch. Not until 1984, when  Mandela required surgery for removal of his enlarged prostate gland, did the  whole family get together for the first time since 1962.    Their daughters, Zenani, 30, and Zindziswa, 29, have joined what is now a  family cause, speaking and traveling on behalf of their parents. Mandela also  had three children from his first marriage. One son, Makgatho, 39, runs a  general store in the Transkei homeland, and a daughter, Makaziwe, 35, is  working on a doctorate in anthropology at the University of Massachusetts. One  son died in an auto accident several years ago.    When he was first imprisoned on Robben Island, Mandela spent most of his time  at hard labor, quarrying limestone, but through repeated protests he won  permission to study and garden. In recent years, he has exercised vigorously,  using an exercise bicycle.

Others, but for his counsel, might have rushed  precipitously into revolution that would turn into a racial civil war that no  one wants,"" said Patrick Lekota, a leader of the United Democratic Front who  served five years on a treason conviction that was recently overturned on  appeal.    While on Robben Island, a penal colony off Cape Town and for seven years at  Pollsmoor Prison in the city's suburbs, Mandela trained two generations of  cadres for the African National Congress and reshaped the outlook of scores of  political prisoners, some of whom were ideologically opposed to the ANC.    Those who know Mandela best are confident that upon release, he will at once  rejoin the campaign against apartheid. But they describe him as a practical man  who will also reassure the country's 5 million whites of his commitment to a  nonracial society.    Helen Suzman, 72, a leading liberal member of the white house of Parliament,  has seen Mandela a half-dozen times over the years. After lunch with him at his  prison quarters last summer, she described him as ""an extraordinary man.""    ""As always,"" she said, ""I was impressed by his obvious leadership qualities,  his moderation and his appreciation of the fear of the white minority. His  unconditional release and his presence at the negotiating table is an absolute  prerequisite to"" peace in South Africa.    ""Unlike white people anywhere else in Africa, whites in South Africa belong  here -- this is their home,"" Mandela told Samuel Dash, a law professor and  former chief counsel for the Senate Watergate Committee, four years ago.    But Mandela also made clear his determination to see apartheid ended  completely, not adapted through the government's step-by-step reforms, Dash  wrote in the New York Times Magazine.    ""If white leaders do not act in good faith toward us, if they will not meet  with us to discuss political equality and if, in effect, they tell us we must  remain subjugated by whites, then there is really no alternative other than  violence,"" Mandela told Dash. ""And, I assure you, we will prevail.""    It was the same sense of conviction and reasonableness that he showed in 1964  when he explained why he had turned to sabotage after two decades of nonviolent  protest.    ""I do not deny that I planned sabotage,"" he told the court from the prisoner's  dock. ""I did not plan it in a spirit of recklessness, nor because I have any  love of violence. I planned it as a result of a calm and sober assessment of  the political situation that had arisen after many years of tyranny,  exploitation and oppression of my people by the whites.""    Mandela, born in 1918, was the eldest son of a chief of the Xhosa-speaking  Thembu people in Transkei, and he was raised with the self-assurance of African  royalty in the household of the Thembus' paramount chief.    He studied at South Africa's Fort Hare University, where Zimbabwe's prime  minister, Robert Mugabe, and other leaders of independent black Africa have  studied. He was expelled for helping organize a student strike.    He went to Johannesburg, worked for a time as a mine policeman and clerk,  graduated from the University of the Witwatersrand and then became apprenticed  to a white law firm before he established his own practice with Oliver R.  Tambo, a friend from Fort Hare, who is now the president in exile of the  African National Congress. (He earned a formal law degree in 1989 through  correspondence courses.)    In 1944, Mandela joined the congress, which had been founded in 1912, and with  Tambo and other young men turned it from petitions for redress of blacks'  grievances to protests on a broader scale. When the National Party came to  power in 1948 and began to impose its apartheid policies on the country, the  congress, under Mandela's and Tambo's direction, launched renewed campaigns of  civil disobedience.    Mandela was at first given a suspended sentence for violating the country's  security laws, then was silenced and restricted in his movements by a  government ""banning"" order. Later, he was detained along with 155 others,  charged with treason and, after a four-year trial that ended in 1961, acquitted  along with the other defendants.    The African National Congress was outlawed in the wake of the protests that  followed the fatal police shooting on March 21, 1960, of 69 blacks engaged in  passive resistance at Sharpeville, a black township about 50 miles south of  Johannesburg.    The congress then turned to sabotage and away from its campaigns of passive  resistance that, following the example of India's Mohandas K. Gandhi, were  aimed at pressuring the government to end apartheid and convene an all-race  national convention to write a new constitution.    Mandela was a central figure in this shift, drawing up the plans to establish  the congress underground and becoming the first commander of its military wing.  Sabotage was to be the strategy to disrupt the economy and scare away capital.  But, to avoid loss of life, terrorism, guerrilla war and a full-scale rebellion  were ruled out.    ""There comes a time, as it came in my life,"" he declared at his trial, ""when a  man is denied the right to live a normal life, when he can only live the life  of an outlaw because the government has so decreed to use the law to impose a  state of outlawry upon him. I was driven to this situation, and I do not regret  the decisions that I did take.""    Slipping across the border, Mandela visited Ethiopia, Algeria and other African  countries, arranging military training for congress members and undergoing a  brief training course himself. His secret return to South Africa and his  daredevil underground existence earned him the title of the ""Black Pimpernel""  and added to his romantic image among blacks.    He was caught eventually, sentenced to five years in prison for incitement to  violence and leaving the country illegally. While serving that term, he was  brought back to court, charged with treason and eventually convicted of  sabotage along with most of the Spear of the Nation's high command.    This was to be the temporary end of Mandela and of the African National  Congress. Most of its leaders were in jail or exile, and scores of its  grass-roots members were arrested. Its guerrillas made occasional bomb attacks,  but were usually caught quickly. The underground organization was heavily  infiltrated by the police.    Winnie Mandela, now 54, a social worker by training, took up the cause but was  quickly ""banned"" herself, barred from politics and eventually exiled to the  small farming community of Brandfort in the Orange Free State. She returned to  Soweto in 1985, defying the government's restrictions, and was allowed to stay.    Married 31 years, they lived together for only four months, and for only a few  weeks at a time. For years, they were separated by thick glass when she made  closely supervised visits in prison, unable even to touch. Not until 1984, when  Mandela required surgery for removal of his enlarged prostate gland, did the  whole family get together for the first time since 1962.    Their daughters, Zenani, 30, and Zindziswa, 29, have joined what is now a  family cause, speaking and traveling on behalf of their parents. Mandela also  had three children from his first marriage. One son, Makgatho, 39, runs a  general store in the Transkei homeland, and a daughter, Makaziwe, 35, is  working on a doctorate in anthropology at the University of Massachusetts. One  son died in an auto accident several years ago.    When he was first imprisoned on Robben Island, Mandela spent most of his time  at hard labor, quarrying limestone, but through repeated protests he won  permission to study and garden. In recent years, he has exercised vigorously,  using an exercise bicycle.    With daily newspapers, a radio, television and a steady flow of books and  magazines, Mandela managed in recent years to keep himself fully informed on  developments in South Africa and elsewhere. Until 1988, political discussions  with other black nationalist leaders who were his cellmates were daily fare.    Close friends said that although Mandela enjoyed the large house on the prison  farm, he felt isolated and missed the daily contact of other prisoners, who  were allowed infrequent visits.    Mandela's long incarceration did not, contrary to the expectations of the  government, turn him into a non-person, forgotten by his supporters. Instead,  his leadership image of self-sacrifice and refusal to compromise with apartheid  has been enhanced to the point of legend.

0,FT931-6672 ,"FT931-6672 _AN-DB1AEAFDFT 930227   FT  27 FEB 93 / Arts: Scales meets Beckett      By ALASTAIR MACAULAY   TO MOST British theatre-goers, Samuel Beckett's 1961 classic Happy Days is an unknown quantity, whereas Prunella Scales, the latest interpreter of its central role, is - thanks to TV - a household name. At the West Yorkshire Playhouse's new staging, it is soon obvious that Happy Days, though Scales can reveal just about every comic facet in it, is nothing like the various comedies that have made her name. Not since Aeschylus's Prometheus Bound has a protagonist been so tied to the earth. In Act One, Winnie is up to her waist in earth; in Act Two, up to her neck. She is not all alone. Many of her words are addressed to her enfeebled and laconic husband Willie, though he is usually out of sight and often out of hearing. Communication, contact, memory are ebbing. No observer could miss the absurdity of this situation. Or the pathos of it. Scales's Winnie is Northern, middle-class, genteel, dowdy, fading. Nothing about her is heroic. Most of what she says she has said so often that her voice sometimes grows flattened and monotonous from custom. Scales catches Winnie's nervous system; and, when she gabbles, she is alarmingly real. If anything, she over-characterises Winnie (she is nearly the flip side of Thora Hird in Alan Bennett's Talking Heads) - gives Winnie more surface than essence. When, for example, she says 'Ah yes, things have their life, that is what I always say, things have a life,' you are more struck by her quaint way of lingering on final consonants ('thinnngs') than by what she is saying. In general, however, she so illuminates Beckett's words that afterwards, checking, I was amazed to note how almost every detail arose from his mind, not hers - even the overlap of her laughter with Willie's. She has complete ease with Winnie's constant change of mood; she is as natural speaking of 'the happy day to come when flesh melts at so many degrees', or suppressing a sob in 'That is what I find so wonderful,' as she is when prodding Willie with her parasol or reprimanding him for his personal habits. In details of timing, Scales, Robin Bowerman (Willie) and their director, Jude Kelly, do Becket proud. In two important features, however, this staging diminishes text and play. Both concern our sense of time, and affect the play's larger meaning. Firstly, the two acts are separated here only by a brief scene-adjustment and pause - as Tynan recommended, after the 1962 Royal Court production. But, by doing away with an interval (the play runs at 90 minutes), Kelly has weakened the sense of time's passing. Secondly, the text is heavily sprinkled with pauses - 'too full of infertile pauses,' wrote Tynan. Scales and Kelly, however, leave few pauses longer than a breath, and leave none of them infertile. Scales's eyes and mouth are always nervously on the move. Likewise, in Act One, her hands. The result is rather too rushed, with little sense of waiting, of speech confronting The Great Silence - not just Willie's silence, but the silence of heaven and earth. Pamela Howard's set, with scorched earth vanishing into baking sky, would be ideal if only Winnie's mound were shaped more like a gentle cone, less like a lump of sea-wall. Even so, Happy Days remains a masterpiece of moderist theatre; and, in Leeds, its meanings are all present. Winnie, the ageing breast (or mons Veneris); Willie, the ageing cock. The moods in which a woman addresses the loss of sexual activity, sexual identity, social colloquy, personal memory. The way that the sexes' struggle for power still surfaces. The touching fluctuations of the human spirit while seeing dust inexorably return to dust. Winnie to Willie: 'Just to know you are there within hearing and conceivably on the semi-alert is . . . er . . . paradise enow.'   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

What makes Danica nervous that is some people don't want to know who Winnie  really is. They want to believe Kevin and Winnie's relationship is as authentic  and tangible as their own fragile memories of first love. ""So many people are  tied up in the relationship,"" Danica said. ""It's kind of freaky.""    Fred Savage agrees. ""Sometimes when I'm walking down the street, people will  yell out, ""Hey Kevin, where's Winnie?,"" he said. ""It just makes me laugh.""

When Danica was 12, she answered a cattle call  for the role of Winnie. The field was ultimately narrowed down to her and  another girl-her younger sister.    ""I tried out for the part with my sister, Crystal,"" Danica said. ""We both got a  call back the next day. It was down to just the two of us. They kept us there  until late that night trying to decide. Finally, they told me that I got the  job, but they liked Crystal so much that they wrote a part for her also.""

[Mandela] It is perfectly reasonable that some people should  have reservations, but it is the task of our organization to put  our policy to them, explain it as fully as possible, and leave  it to them to decide. I am convinced that we have the best  policy in the country and that there is no other political  organization which has got a policy as progressive as we have, a  policy that takes into account the aspirations of all our  peoples and which is in a better position to address their basic  needs.    [Snow] Now, over the weekend President De Klerk has called  the ANC a party of violence that has lost control of its  supporters. This is pretty heavy stuff so early in the campaign.  Is there any truth in it?    [Mandela] Well, Mr. De Klerk is the last person to make that  accusation, because the task of maintaining law and order and  making sure that there is no violence is that of the government  of the country.    [Snow] The relationship between you has been very critical  in  order to get us to this point. Now that the campaign is  underway it sounds as if that relationship is already under very  great stress?    [Mandela] No, that is a misleading impression because we  have  never ceased to exchange views on matters of common interest.  This last week we have met twice and have had very fruitful  discussions. But in the course of the campaign it is likely that  we will say very cruel things about each other, but that does  not affect our ability to come together whenever it is necessary  to address the problems facing the country.    [Snow] Well, now can we look at what you are promising the  electorate. Let's first start on the question of violence.  What is the ANC going to do in government to try to contain  what is happening in the townships, particularly amongst young  people where it is practically out of control?    [Mandela] Well, again that is not a correct impression  because although the young people are angry and are justified in  being angry, they are at the same disciplined -- when you give  them a lead they listen and they follow. As for the question of  violence -- after a democratic government has been installed, a  government which has state power and which has got the will to  put an end to the violence will receive the support of the  population. Our problem is that we are dealing with a lame duck  president and government who is completely weak, and unruly  elements have taken advantage of that.    [Snow] On the economic front, Mr. Mandela, the ANC has a  close relationship with the Communist Party of South Africa; it  has talked of nationalization, of redistribution in the past.  What is the economic policy briefly to be?    [Mandela] Well, I think as far as the question of the  Communist Party is concerned, that is a nonissue as far as we  are concerned. We are not even prepared to discuss it. As far  as our economic policy is concerned we are not following any  particular model. Our concern is to have sufficient resources  to address the basic needs of our people, like the high level of  unemployment, lack of housing, education, and medical  facilities, electricity, lack of running water, roads -- all  those things. Any particular strategy which will enable us to  address these problems we will adopt.    [Snow] Well, now can I just touch upon what happens with  Winnie Mandela after the election. She is very well placed to  get a good cabinet position in the post-independent government,  in the multiracial government. What kind of reassurances can  you give people -- given that she has had to face such serious  charges under the old regime?    [Mandela] She is a very popular figure and I think that any  government when it decides on allocating portfolio's will  consider the influence which a particular individual commands.    [Snow] Well, can I just ask you finally about yourself. we  are talking at six o'clock in the morning. I gather you have  been up already for an hour and a half, obviously you are  extremely fit but an enormous amount depends on you. This is  going to be a most exhausting campaign.    [Mandela] Well, as soon as I have finished with this  interview I am going to take my coat and walk to the game  reserve. That is where I am going to relax for the next five  days. We are trying to find opportunities, in the midst of a  very heavy program, of relaxing and resting, and I think that  will enable me to go through some of the strenuous assignments  which I would be given during the next three months.    [Snow] I gather that before we talked this morning you have  already been through a regime which is pretty similar to that  which you used to undertake in prison?    [Mandela] Well, I was explaining just the other day that  this  is something that is part of our system, not because I have  wanted to but because of the experiences I have had, and to that  extent I am grateful that I am able to get up as early as  possible and do some solid work before others start.    [Snow] Do you not feel terribly exhausted at the end of the  day?    [Mandela] There are days, of course, when I do feel tired,  but generally speaking at the end of the day I have got a  feeling of accomplishment that I have done a good day's work  which has been productive and that is very inspiring indeed, and  you go back feeling that your day has been worthwhile, and you  have done some good for the country and for your people.

[Mandela] Well, they say that old age is part of your  spirit,  and if you think you are young you will naturally feel young, if  you feel you are old and defeated you will feel old and aged.

SOLDIER LED UNUSUAL LIFE;    PERI AS SPY: UNBELIEVABLE TO THOSE WHO KNEW HIM      By JEAN DAVIDSON, Times Staff Writer      While living with his family in South Africa, Michael Peri carried the U.S.  flag for a drill team founded by his mother, a group of uprooted American  teen-agers who called themselves the Patriettes.    Like many other youths living in the expatriate colony about 100 miles  northeast of Johannesburg, Peri became protective of all things American. He  was so concerned that the nasal Afrikaner clip would creep into his U.S.  accent, a family friend recalled, that the California native acquired a Texas  twang.    A decade later, the same young man who struggled to retain his American  identity has admitted betraying his country. Spec. Michael A. Peri, an  intelligence analyst for the Army, pleaded guilty to espionage and was  sentenced on Saturday to 30 years in a military prison.    Once considered a model soldier, Peri was described by Army prosecutors during  his court-martial as a ""Judas"" who acted on his spy fantasies by slipping into  East Germany with U.S. military secrets and giving away the store.    The picture that has emerged of the young soldier since he returned from the  Eastern bloc nation and surrendered in West Germany is unfamiliar to those who  thought they knew him best. Family friends and military buddies expressed  disbelief that the Michael Peri they knew could become a foreign agent, if only  for a confused, brief moment.    ""He's a good, wholesome kid who went into the Army because he was looking for  direction,"" said Linda Later, a Salt Lake City publisher who became close  friends with the Peri family while living in South Africa. Later recently  helped line up defense attorneys for the accused soldier. ""I can't believe that  he would do this. I can't accept it at all.""      Authorities at a Loss    Peri's disappearance was also baffling to officials of the 11th Armored Cavalry  Regiment in Fulda, West Germany, where Peri had been stationed. The young  soldier, described as well-liked and highly trusted, left behind a new Honda  Civic, a stereo, skis and clothing when he fled to East Germany with a laptop  computer and military secrets last Feb. 20. He returned and surrendered 12 days  later, but even after his court-martial, authorities are at a loss.    ""The question we have never been able to answer is why,"" said Sgt. Major Dale  McInnis, spokeswoman for the 5th Army Corps in West Germany. Peri has not been  accessible by the media since his return from East Germany.    Peri, described by friends as an average American kid, led an international  childhood that was anything but typical. The second of Fred and Winnie Peri's  three children, Michael spent his early years in a middle-class neighborhood of  La Habra. But Fred Peri's career as a project engineer for Fluor Daniels Corp.,  an international firm based in Irvine, soon took the family all over the globe.  They moved eight times before Michael turned 20.    The family lived for about three years in South Africa while Fred Peri worked  on the construction of a refinery, according to Later, whose husband also  worked for Fluor Daniels there. Young Peri and his sister, Desiree, traveled to  Austria to attend the Salzburg International Preparatory School in 1981-82 and  then returned to South Africa to enroll in Evander High Sc hool the following  year.    Another job transfer took the Peris back to Orange County in 1983, and  additional house moves caused Michael to switch from Fountain Valley High  School to La Quinta High School in Westminster before graduating with mediocre  grades in 1983. Michael Peri joined the Army Reserves and, after completing a  two-year tour, moved briefly with his family to a Chicago suburb. In 1987,  after his parents returned to California and began construction on a house in  Laguna Niguel, Peri entered active duty and qualified for an elite intelligence  training course.    California, Africa, Europe -- to many it might sound like a glamorous life. But  it was a difficult path for a shy young man, and one that his parents  apologized for during wrenching testimony at Peri's sentencing hearing.    ""This is not my Michael,"" Fred Peri told a military jury. ""He's a quiet,  unassuming young man. He's been under a lot of stress. Maybe when we raised  him, we didn't teach him how to deal with stress. We insulated him.""    Winnie Peri described her turbulent childhood in an alcoholic family and said  that, as a result, she had been overprotective of her children.    ""Maybe we did spoil our children,"" she testified. ""We helped them along the  way. I didn't have possessions when I grew up. I wanted them to have it better  than I had it. We've given them an opportunity not to grow up, not to mature. I  see that might be wrong now.""    Peri said that he made an impulsive mistake when he crossed into East Germany  with a computer and four floppy discs that contained details of U.S. troop  movements in West Germany and Army estimates of Soviet military strength. He  complained that he felt overworked and unappreciated in his job as an  intelligence specialist for the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment in Fulda.    And, as he pleaded for forgiveness, Michael Peri the red-blooded American  appeared again.    ""People don't think I have remorse for what I've done,"" Peri said, crying. ""But  I'm willing to join combat arms . . . and put my life on the line in a  front-line unit during the war.""    To Sean Regan, who served with Peri in a Los Alamitos Army Reserve unit from  1985 to 1987, the combat offer reflected Peri's early patriotic enthusiasm.  Regan, who is no longer a reservist, was a junior noncommissioned officer  assigned to help train Peri in intelligence analysis.    ""He was a good guy, and he really seemed to enjoy the work we were doing,"" said  Regan, of Westminster. ""When you're dealing with national security and you get  your (security) clearance, you get something that only 2% of the country can  get.""    But, Regan noted, working for a ""glorious unit on the front lines,"" such as the  11th Armored Cavalry, ""can go to your head.""    ""You're planning war, and moving tanks and troops. It's a game, it's like  chess. To me, that's very exciting, and that's how Mike felt too.""    In an interview in March, Peri's uncle, Bob Andre of La Habra, also recalled  the young soldier's interest in intelligence work. Michael Peri had spoken  during a visit home last December of pursuing a career with the CIA, Andre  said.    ""He told me that he was going to put his time in military intelligence and  after he came out, he was going to go back to college,"" Andre said. ""Then, with  his background in intelligence, he was going to apply for a job with the CIA.""    Prosecutors depicted Peri as a cunning young man whose fantasies of espionage  and intrigue were fueled by a magazine article that Peri read three days before  his flight. Peri seemed fascinated with the story, about the Marine spy scandal  at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, and bragged to friends about his high-level  security clearance, according to Maj. Michael Graham, the lead prosecutor.    ""He was the proverbial fox in the chicken house,"" Graham said. ""He violated the  trust his unit had placed in him. And like Judas betrayed Jesus at the Last  Supper, Specialist Peri kissed off his friends, kissed off his family, kissed  off his unit and kissed off his country.""    A jury panel of five officers deliberated only two hours before returning with  a sentence of 30 years in prison. According to the terms of a plea agreement,  Peri's sentence will be reduced by 5 years if he serves his first three years  in prison with good behavior. At the earliest, Peri could be paroled in 10  years.    ""That kid was working 100 hours a week over there in a highly stressful job  with nobody he could talk to,"" said Michael A. Martinson of Brea, who has known  the Peri family since they were neighbors in La Habra in 1963 and described  Michael as like his own son.    ""I think the Army made an example of him, and I find it impossible to believe  that he did what they say he did. Up until the last, I was hoping that he would  be exonerated.""    Later, who has been in daily contact with Fred and Winnie Peri, described the  parents as ""numb"" following the sentencing. And although Later described Peri's  decision to go to East Germany as ""a screw-up; 22-year-olds screw up,"" she  insisted that the soldier is no spy.    ""If anything, Mike's on the klutzy side,"" she said. ""If I were on a mission and  Mike were on a mission, I'd worry about him screwing up. Not about being loyal  -- just making a mistake.""

However, many of these  candidates, including a former Springok rugby player, have not  yet accepted their nominations. On the line now, we have ANC  spokesman Carl Niehaus. Mr. Niehous, good morning. How  predictable are these nominations? Were most of them expected?    [Niehaus] Good morning. Actually, the nominations have been  a very wide group of people that all the different Mass  Democratic Movement organizations in South Africa have come  forward with. So one would get a much wider net than just  simply members of the ANC, and I suppose in that context some of  the names that have been proposed may be surprising to members  of the media.    [Trudgeon] How significant is it that a lot of these pople  have not yet accepted their nominations?    [Niehaus] Well, I think that indicates that the lists that  have now become public are only provisional lists; that one  cannot at this stage say that any particular person is yet going  to stand as a candidate for the ANC, or is in fact going to be  elected to Parliament. All of that depends on whether those  candidates are prepared to accept their nominations, and then of  course there are still provincial lists conferences this coming  weekend, where the 14 different regions of the ANC's nominations  will be consolidated into the 9 provinces, and then of course  there will be a national list conference on 15 January, where  the final lists will be consolidated, and they will be made  public on 18 January. So only on 18 January will we be able to  present to South Africa a final list of candidates which will  stand for the ANC and would have actually accepted their  nominations.    [Trudgeon] Now a feature of the nomination list is, quite a  few media and sports personalities. I'm thinking of people like  Bruce Fordyce, Felicia Mabuza-Suttle, Jacqui Mofekeng, the Miss  South Africa. This aspect of the list has in fact been  criticized, for example, by the National Party.    [Niehaus] Well, you know, the National Party can express  their criticism, but the fact of the matter is that there are  many people, prominent persons in South African society, who  associate themselves far more with the ideals of nonracialism  and democracy, as the ANC has fought for it through all the  decades, and one will probably find that some of these prominent  personalities will accept nomination. That is also not anything  new. Throughout the world, for example in the United States,  there have been, from time to time, members of the cultural  community, actors, etcetera, who have shown their support for a  particular political organization, because they share those  ideals. But I must emphasize that many of the persons who are  mentioned there -- sportsmen, actors, etcetera -- have not yet  been approached, and their nominations still have to be checked  with them, and only after they have made a decision can one  actually say that they have accepted it, and that they are  prepared to associate themselves, on that particular level, with  the ANC.    [Trudgeon] Perhaps one of the most important omissions,  which  I notice newspapers and the media have taken up in general, is  that Winnie Mandela is absent from both lists. Is there any  significance in that?    [Niehaus] Well, I don't think one should read too much  significance in it. The lists that you have received now are a  list for the provisional parliament candidatures of the PWV  [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] region, and also the PWV  region's nominations for the National Assembly. But there is  also a general National Assembly list which has been voted on,  but that counting has not been finished yet, and therefore it  has not been made public, and on that list, as one of the  nominees, Mrs. Mandela did appear. So her name can still  appear, depending on how the voting went on the national list  for the National Assembly.    [Trudgeon] There has also apparently been sweeping support  for Peter Mokaba, the youth leader.    [Niehaus] Yes. That is the situation, that there has been  strong support for Mr. Mobkaba.    [Trudgeon] Mr. Niehaus, one of the criticisms leveled at  your  list came from Wits [Witwatersrand University] political analyst  Professor Tom Lodge, who mentioned that the list is perhaps a  little short of business talent. Now I know you have people  like Sam Motsuenyane being nominated. How do you feel about the  lack of business talent?    [Niehaus] Well, I don't think there is a lack of business  talent. Again, it is unfortunate that categorical statements  about these lists are being made at a stage when, really, only  the list of the PWV region is now public. There are namy, many  other provinces and regions that have made nominations, and  there are also a considerable number of busines people on the  national list for the National Assembly. So I would caution  that analysts must wait until the final list comes out, before  they can make those kinds of deductions.    [Trudgeon] It's also significant that some of the people who  have been nominated are not really standing, because they  belong, now, to other organizations. I'm thinking of Rev. Frank  Chikane, and also Mr. Zwelakhi Sisulu, who has been appointed  Mr. Harmse's assistant here at the SABC [South African  Broadcasting Corporation].    [Niehaus] Well, what has happened is that we left the  nomination process open, so that anyone could be nominated, and  then we leave it up to those particular individuals, in  consultation with the ANC, to accept their nominations or to  decline. Rev. Chikane has already indicated that he declines  because he is not eligible to stand for any political  organization, because of his position as a member of the  Independent Electoral Commission. I believe the same will  account for Mr. Sisulu, who is now the deputy to Mr. Harmse, or  at least the nominated deputy to Mr. Harmse at the SABC.     "

He gets a suspended sentence and is barred from attending  meetings or leaving Johannesburg.    December, 1956    A campaign of civil disobedience by the ANC results in Mandela being detained  along with 155 others and charged with treason. The trial, which lasts until  1961, ends in acquittal.    March, 1960    Sixty-nine black protesters are killed by police in Sharpeville; a state of  emergency is declared and the ANC is outlawed.    January, 1962    Attends Pan-African Freedom Movement Conference in Ethiopia; travels to London  to meet with leftists. In August he is charged with incitement and leaving the  country illegally; gets five-year jail term.    July, 1963    With Mandela in jail, police raid ANC offices, seizing documents outlining  guerrilla campaign. Mandela, seven others are charged with sabotage and  conspiracy to overthrow the government.    April-June, 1964    Mandela and seven others are sentenced to life in prison.    May, 1984    Mandela is allowed a visit with his wife -- the first since 1962.    January, 1985    President Pieter W. Botha offers to free Mandela if he renounces violence;  Mandela refuses until the government takes steps to dismantle apartheid and  grants full political rights to blacks.    July, 1988    Mandela turns 70. A rock concert in London is held in his honor. But South  Africa bans all local celebrations.    August, 1988    Mandela contracts tuberculosis and is transferred to a hospital. Three months  later he is taken to a prison farm in Paarl and placed in a house usually  reserved for prison employees.    July, 1989    Mandela meets with outgoing president Botha at the presidential mansion. One  week later, Mandela is allowed to make his first officially sanctioned public  statement since his conviction. His statement makes clear his position has not  changed in 28 years.    December, 1989    President Frederik W. de Klerk meets Mandela for the first time.    February, 1990    De Klerk lifts ANC ban and says Mandela will be released.

May, 1984    Mandela is allowed a visit with his wife -- the first since 1962.    January, 1985    President Pieter W. Botha offers to free Mandela if he renounces violence;  Mandela refuses until the government takes steps to dismantle apartheid and  grants full political rights to blacks.    July, 1988    Mandela turns 70. A rock concert in London is held in his honor. But South  Africa bans all local celebrations.    August, 1988    Mandela contracts tuberculosis and is transferred to a hospital. Three months  later he is taken to a prison farm in Paarl and placed in a house usually  reserved for prison employees.    July, 1989    Mandela meets with outgoing president Botha at the presidential mansion. One  week later, Mandela is allowed to make his first officially sanctioned public  statement since his conviction. His statement makes clear his position has not  changed in 28 years.    December, 1989    President Frederik W. de Klerk meets Mandela for the first time.    February, 1990    De Klerk lifts ANC ban and says Mandela will be released. On Feb. 11, the  nation's best-known black leader becomes a free man at last.      Photo, Mandela in 1958.; Photo, A pro-Mandela protest earlier this month.

0,FT921-7379 ,"FT921-7379 _AN-CBVAEAC1FT 920222   FT  22 FEB 92 / Books: A chicken and egg situation      By MICHAEL HOLMAN   AFTER APARTHEID by Sebastian Mallaby Faber  Faber Pounds 14.99, 224 pages IT IS a brave journalist who, in his own book about South Africa, draws attention to a classic text by a member of the same profession. Sebastian Mallaby of the Economist, based in southern Africa from 1989-90, acknowledges Move Your Shadow by Joe Lelyveld of the New York Times as one of his 'models of good writing'. After Apartheid has much to recommend it. There are some sharp observations and insights, and revealing anecdotes. It combines detachment with sensitivity. But it does not stand the comparison that has been invited. It may be that it is simply too soon to write a book about South Africa's transition to democracy. Explaining why apartheid failed is one thing. It is very much more difficult to say what will replace it. 'With its communists and neo-Nazis, its Christians, Jews and Muslims, its Afrikaners and English, its Indians and Coloureds, Xhosas and Zulus, Sothos and Vendas - with all its bubbling variety, how could South Africa build the basic consensus that democracy requires?' Quite so. 'South Africa's new constitution would have to cater to diversity of both race and tribe . . . the question was how to do it.' The irritating use of tense implies an historical perspective from which the author can provide the answer. He cannot, though his guess may well turn out to be correct. Neither the African National Congress nor the National Party has an alternative to negotiations, writes Mallaby. The ANC will be an important partner, if not the senior partner, in any future coalition - although it is not clear just where Mangosuthu Buthelezi fits in; and at least one or two white politicians will remain in the cabinet. But too little of the negotiating process has unfolded to allow Mallaby to show us just how South Africa will get from its current state to consensus and coalition; or what lessons other African countries can draw from South Africa's exercise in constitution making when it comes to resolving their own ethnic tensions, and reconciling majority rule with minority rights. Around this unsatisfactory core of the book are excursions into South Africa's familiar past, further predictions, and tenuously linked accounts of the author's experiences in Nigeria, Kenya, Zimbabwe and Mozambique. No new ground is broken in sections dealing with the effect of sanctions on the South African economy, the bloody rivalry between black political parties, or the well known story of Winnie Mandela and her gang of thugs. Fears of a violent backlash from the extreme white right are seen as exaggerated, although several South African cabinet ministers are not so confident. Perhaps Mallaby has fallen between two stools. In presenting South Africa's search for post-apartheid democracy against the wider backdrop of Africa's post-independence disaster, he has been able to do justice to neither. Of course he is right to stress the critical importance of land redistribution in post-apartheid South Africa, and it forms one of the most interesting chapters in the book. But a whistle stop examination of land policies in Tanzania, Ethiopia, Zimbabwe and Kenya, with a few paragraphs on Asia and South America thrown in, is not very helpful. Mallaby is at his best when reporting, rather than speculating or providing potted history. His account of an excursion aboard a South African company jet doing the rounds of its commercial outposts is as revealing as it is entertaining. The run takes in Malawi, which does not hide its trade with Pretoria; Mozambique, where the company managed the state-owned chicken farms; Zambia, where sanctions obliged the company to pose as British and route faxes from Johannesburg via London; and Zaire, where hens and hen-coops were flown in from South Africa in response to President Mobutu sese Seko's demand for a chicken farm. There was one problem. The hens were not laying, and the president was expecting distinguished guests. They would want to see results. So another plane was despatched, loaded with eggs, one to be tucked under each chicken. 'A European company would never have done that', said the shrewd South African chairman.

The  number could rise to 10,000, he said. Speaking on the steps of  Tuynhuys after their meeting, Mr Mandela said he had asked the  PAC leader for a list of PAC members who could be included in  the new government's civil service and diplomatic corps. Mr  Mandela said APLA members had fought and suffered. They should  be included even though they applied for membership after the  cutoff date for inclusion of non-statutory forces in the SANDF.    Mr Mandela said his discussions with Mr Makwetu were part of  an ongoing attempt to forge unity. ""As long as I am president,  I think this dialogue should continue,"" Mr Mandela said. ""We  are busy on an initiative intended to bring about a unified  approach in dealing with questions which are of concern to the  people of South Africa."" He was encouraged by the co-operation  he was receiving from other political parties.    On Wednesday, Mr Mandela met Conservative Party leader Ferdi  Hartzenberg and next week he will meet Afrikaner  Weerstandsbeweging [Afrikaner Resistance Movement] leader Eugene  Terreblanche.    Before meeting Mr Makwetu, Mr Mandela held an hour-long  meeting with acting democratic party leader Tony Leon. Mr  Mandela said he welcomed a loyal parliamentary opposition. ""The  fact that people differ with us is no reason why we should not  give attention to their ideas. The role of the opposition is to  draw attention to those things we may not be alive to.""     "

He is in the  Netherlands for two days for political talks and a for a special  television program on the upcoming elections in April.    Despite the huge domestic problems, Nelson Mandela is  optimistic about the forthcoming first-ever democratic  elections. He does not rule out that the Inkatha movement also  will participate, despite Inkatha leader Buthelezi's statements  that ANC concessions for greater regional autonomy are not  sufficient.    [Begin recording] [Boonman] Nelson Mandela arrived at the  Hilversum television studio tonight for the taping of a special  program. He does not want to discuss the difficult negotiations  with the right-wing whites and the Zulu movement Inkatha.    [Unidentified reporter in English with Dutch subtitles] How  important is a fund-raising evening for the ANC in the  Netherlands?    [Mandela] Well, our visits to the Netherlands have always  been crowned with success.    [Boonman] During the special program, money will be  collected  for election projects in South Africa. [end recording]    [Dijkstra] Mandela started his visit to the Netherlands with  a luncheon at the Catshuis [prime minister's residence]. He  spoke among others with Prime Minister Lubbers and Vice Prime  Minister Kok. Yesterday in Johannesburg, the ANC leader made  promises to the right-wing white organizations and to the  Inkatha movement. He promised them a greater say in the future  South Africa. Inkatha has rejected the offer, but Mandela  remains optimistic.    [Begin recording] [Mandela] As far as my understanding of  his  [Buthelezi] comments, it does appear that he has left the door  open if ANC clarifies the offers it has made. I therefore  believe that it is premature for us to decide that he has  rejected the offer.    [Boonman] Mandela does not rule greater autonomy in order to  draw all parties to the elections.    [Mandela] In a case where you are trying to build a new  country, there can be no final concession. Concessions are  inherent in negotiations.    [Boonman] The Netherlands Government has assured Mr. Mandela  that it would also assist the new South Africa with money. In  an interview with Lubbers and Mandela to be broadcast later  tonight on Nederland-3, Lubbers agrees to pay this price.    [Lubbers in English with Dutch subtitles] I would not  exclude  the possibility of supporting Mr. Mandela as a symbol, not only  because of the elections, but also as a symbol to say: Let us  set out a new course for the future.    [Boonman] Before he leaves tomorrow, Mr. Mandela will meet  with Netherlands businessmen to persuade them to invest in South  Africa. [end recording]    [Dijkstra] Tomorrow morning Nelson Mandela will also meet  Yasir 'Arafat. The PLO leader arrives late today and will be  received tomorrow by Prime Minister Lubbers.     "

HE CITES  'THIRST' FOR HUMAN RIGHTS.      By EDWIN CHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER      WASHINGTON      Invoking the names of American heroes and language from the Declaration of  Independence, a tough-talking Nelson Mandela drew a rousing reception Tuesday  as he became the first black private citizen to address a joint session of  Congress.    ""Our people demand democracy,"" Mandela said during a 33-minute speech, by far  the longest and most eloquent yet on his 12-day, eight-city U.S. tour.  ""Unhappily, our people continue to die to this day, victims of the armed agents  of the state.""    The South African people, he said, ""thirst"" for the day when the government  will not turn its guns against them for asserting that ""equality, liberty and  the pursuit of happiness are fundamental human rights which are not only  inalienable but must, if necessary, be defended with the weapons of war.""    Striking an uncharacteristically personal note, Mandela, who was released in  February after 27 years in prison, said:    ""We went to jail because it was impossible to sit still while the obscenity of  the apartheid system was being imposed on our people. It would have been  immoral to keep quiet while a racist tyranny sought to reduce an entire people  into a status worse than that of the beasts of the forest.""    Standing ramrod straight in the Speaker's well, the tall, slender Mandela was  interrupted by applause more than 15 times, including several standing ovations  that visibly elated members of his delegation. Also in the audience were  members of President Bush's Cabinet, Washington's diplomatic corps and the  Joint Chiefs of Staff led by its chairman, Gen. Colin L. Powell.    After his address, it took Mandela more than five minutes to work his way  through a crush of cheering, whistling, back-slapping well-wishers as he exited  the packed House chamber.    ""Marvelous,"" Wyoming Sen. Alan K. Simpson, the Republican whip, told Mandela as  they shook hands.    Not once during his appearance did Mandela raise a fist, as he has at virtually  every stop since he landed in New York last Wednesday morning. Instead, he  simply smiled and waved repeatedly.    Later in the day, the deputy president of the African National Congress met  with Senate and House leaders and members of the Senate Foreign Relations and  the House Foreign Affairs committees.    After a scheduled dinner with members of the ANC in the Washington area,  Mandela attended an evening rally at the Washington Convention Center, which  sold out all 19,000 tickets within hours last week.    Mandela began a busy Tuesday on Capitol Hill with a breakfast hosted by the  Congressional Black Caucus that also was attended by spouses and selected  guests, including Virginia Gov. L. Douglas Wilder, Texas Democratic  gubernatorial candidate Ann Richards, Baltimore Mayor Kurt L. Schmoke and  singer Harry Belafonte.    ""It is very rare that people of different political affiliations should be so  united in supporting a cause,"" Mandela told them. ""As far as we are concerned,  it is very difficult to draw a distinction between Democrats and Republicans.""    But some members of Congress stayed away from Mandela's subsequent speech,  including Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), who had fought vigorously but  unsuccessfully against the imposition of sanctions against Pretoria.    Another was Rep. William E. Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton), who had been on the House  floor until shortly before Mandela's arrival. He said that he boycotted ""as a  matter of principle"" and said Mandela is more like the 1960s revolutionary H.  Rap Brown than Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.    But that was a decidedly minority viewpoint on Capitol Hill.    ""To be there, to see him, to have him thank members of the Congressional Black  Caucus, makes my lifetime in politics worthwhile,"" said Rep. Charles B. Rangel  (D-N.Y.), who represents Harlem, where Mandela got a tumultuous greeting last  week.    Despite a punishing itinerary, Mandela's tour organizers at the last minute  added to his schedule a Tuesday noon rally on Pennsylvania Avenue. But  Mandela's motorcade, going from the Capitol to his downtown hotel, did not stop  at Freedom Plaza, where several hundred disappointed people had gathered in  front of Washington's City Hall.    Mandela and his 13-member delegation are to depart this morning for Atlanta,  with subsequent stops in Miami, Detroit and -- on Friday -- Los Angeles.  Mandela is to leave the United States from Oakland on Sunday.    As an eleventh-hour addition to his Los Angeles visit, a private meeting has  been scheduled between Mandela and former Soviet dissident Natan Sharansky, who  was jailed for 8 1/2 years before he was allowed to emigrate to Israel.    Mandela, 71, still has stops in England, Ireland and various cities in Africa  before returning to Soweto in mid-July, according to one Mandela adviser,  Zwelahke Sisulu.    In addressing Congress, Mandela was virtually guaranteed a largely friendly  audience. Four years ago. Congress overrode President Ronald Reagan's veto and  imposed economic sanctions, including trade and travel restrictions, against  South Africa.    On Tuesday, Mandela urged Congress to let the South African people decide when  the sanctions should be lifted.    ""The purpose for which they were imposed has not yet been achieved,"" he said.  ""We have yet to arrive at the point when we can say that South Africa is set on  an irreversible course leading to its transformation into a united, democratic  and non-racial country.""    Mandela brought the packed House chamber and guest gallery to its feet by  saying that black South Africans who are familiar with the works of George  Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Thomas Jefferson, Frederick Douglass and King will  fight for freedom, just as those American heroes did.    Mandela thanked Congress for helping enable many black South Africans ""to  emerge from the darkness of the prison cell and join the contemporary process  of the renewal of the world."" With continued American moral and economic  support, South Africa will become ""an oasis of good race relations,"" Mandela  said.    ""It must surely be that there will be born a country on the southern tip of  Africa which you will be proud to call a friend and an ally,"" he said.    ""Let that day come now. Let us keep our arms locked together so that we form a  solid phalanx against racism to ensure that that day comes now. Peace will not  come to our country and region until the apartheid system is ended.""

The meeting should  have had taken place on 20 June, but when Lula arrived in the  Union Hill Palace at the scheduled time, he was not received by  Mandela. An adviser informed him that Mandela could not receive  him because of a slight ailment.    This was the third meeting between Mandela and Lula. They  met in Tripoli and in Havana. After speaking about the  situation in South Africa Mandela wanted to know about Brazilian  politics and economy. He asked about the situation of the  Brazilian people before the elections. Lula told him about the  election campaign, the Real Plan, and the social reality in the  country. He criticized what he calls ""social-economic  apartheid"" in Brazil and promised to combat it if elected with  ""measures in the field of education, labor, and housing."" The  South African leader told Lula his plans to combat problems  similar to the Brazilian ones.    They also spoke about bilateral relations, especially trade.  Mandela discussed the subject as if Lula had already won the  elections. He said he wanted to visit Brazil as soon as Lula is  installed. He then offered to discuss any subject of bilateral  interest.    At the end of the meeting Mandela accompanied Lula and  Brazilian Ambassador to the RSA Antonio Amaral de Sampaio to  another room where CUT [Sole Workers Center] leader Vicente  Paulo da Silva, Deputy Benedita da Silva, and PT campaign  coordinator Professor Marco Aurelio Garcia were waiting. Soon  afterward they all went to the stairs of the Union Hill Palace  where Lula and Mandela made brief statements.    Following the meeting in Union Hill Palace, Lula, the  ambassador, and his delegation boarded a plane at noon to Cape  Town where Lula is scheduled to dine with other South African  government officials. The host is Minister Without Portfolio Jay  Naidoo, who is responsible for the Development and  Reconstruction Program (DRP). Through this program Mandela  intends to build 1 million houses over five years, create 2.5  million new jobs, and guarantee 10 years of basic and higher  education.    A constituent assembly will be formed on 22 June in Cape  Town. Late in the afternoon Lula and his delegation will return  to Johannesburg and board an plane that will take them to  Frankfurt, Germany, the second leg of his trip.     "

Mr  Mandela said at Tuynhuys on Thursday that he was prepared to  meet UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola]  leader Jonas Savimbi, preferably in South Africa.    Speaking after a meeting with United Nations Mediator  Alioune Blondin Beye and representatives of the United States,  Portuguese and Russian Governments, Mr Mandela said he would  first contact Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and then  Dr Savimbi.    ""I would be happy to invite Dr Savimbi and to sit down and  have a discussion with him. I know Mr dos Santos' point of  view, but I've never had the honour of meeting Dr Savimbi. I am  prepared to see both parties in the near future,"" he said.    Mr Beye said Mr Mandela had been asked to become involved as  the leader of a nation that neighboured Angola and also had  substantial assets there. He said South Africa had  geographical, historical and political ties to Angola.    Mr Mandela said South African companies had invested in oil  and diamond mining in Angola, and an end to the civil war that  has raged since 1975 would be a positive advantage to South  Africa.    Mr Beye said the UN's priority was not to bring about a  direct meeting between Dr Savimbi and Mr dos Santos. It first  wanted to contact Mr dos Santos and then to set up a meeting  between Mr Mandela and Dr Savimbi.     "

Present at the meeting were  six observers in the Angolan peace process, including the U.S.  ambassador in South Africa. Alioune Blondin Beye briefed Nelson  Mandela on the development of the peace talks in Lusaka. Manuel  Augusto, Angolan charge d'affaires in South Africa, told Luanda  Radio Nacional today that the meeting was positive.    [Begin recording] [Augusto] As far as we know, President  Mandela expressed gratitude for the briefing. He also expressed  his readiness, at the request of the relevant parties, to render  his contribution within the framework of the Lusaka talks. In  other words, President Mandela made it clear that he will not  take initiatives which are outside the Lusaka spirit or which  could collide with the Lusaka spirit.    [Unidentified correspondent] We have learned here in Luanda  that President Nelson Mandela has agreed to join the group of  mediators in the Angolan conflict, that he even expressed a  readiness to meet very soon with President Jose Eduardo dos  Santos and Jonas Savimbi, leader of the National Union for the  Total Independence of Angola [UNITA]. When do you think these  meetings will take place, particularly with the president of the  Republic?    [Augusto] In my understanding, I think it is not very  correct  to say that he agreed to join the group of mediators. In his  capacity as the head of state at the present, President Mandela  would not join anyone, because we have no mediators at the level  of heads of state. It is correct to say, however, that  President Mandela expressed a readiness to join efforts aimed at  bringing peace to Angola.    President Mandela also said at the end of the meeting this  afternoon that, at the request of the UN mediators, he is ready  to meet with all the parties involved in the process. It is  important to clarify, however, that at no time was it said that  there would be a summit meeting. As long as he is requested,  President Mandela is ready to take part in or promote meetings  with the Angolan Government and UNITA.    Regarding the meeting with President Jose Eduardo dos  Santos,  President Mandela has just expressed his readiness to meet him.  So, some contacts will be made through the appropriate levels  and channels between the South African Government and the  Angolan Government so that the Angolan Government can tell the  South African Government in which areas it expects it to render  its contribution.

The main purpose of ""Baywatch"" is apparently to celebrate Los Angeles County  lifeguards and the Pacific. Although the sights are beautiful, the premiere is  less a story than a seascape, lacking the dramatic intensity and credible  characters necessary to sustain an hour. Bucannon is not very plausible, but  he's rock-solid compared with Pomeroy, who is described as a successful lawyer  who only moonlights as a lifeguard.    You suspect that the creators of ""Baywatch"" are lifeguards moonlighting as  writers.

""Let me tell you there will be no postponement of  elections...either in the province of Natal or in any of the  provinces,"" Mr Mandela told a youth conference at the University  of Durban-Westville.    ""We will not postpone our freedom...we will not postpone our  plans to build a better life for all South Africans,"" the ANC  president said, scotching speculation the election may be  delayed.    This follows Tuesday's Independent Electoral Committee [IEC]  report on the improbability of holding free and fair elections  in politically charged Natal.    Mr Mandela's remarks were met with wild applause and a  standing ovation from hundreds of youths at the conference. Mr  Mandela also called on people to give the recently declared  state of emergency in natal a chance, saying: ""people have  questioned -- what is the use of this state of emergency if  people continue to be killed?    ""One appreciates this concern, but it comes from people who  have not analysed the situation very well,"" he said. Explaining  his defence of the emergency, Mr Mandela said SA Defence Force  [SADF] deployment was a ""complicated process"".    ""Stem your judgement until the SADF has brought all the  forces required to this province,"" he added.    South Africa had reached a ""very critical stage"" in its  history, Mr Mandela said, referring to recent third force  disclosures by the Goldstone Commission. ""We've been saying all  along the third force exists...we are reaching almost a  breakthrough in this regard...we are finding out the people  responsible for these massacres.""    Mr Mandela said present violence in the country was  ""frightening"".    He accused the national party government of being ""corrupt  ... where public funds have been given to black organisations to  promote violence"".    Mr Mandela said the ANC had enjoyed a measure of success  through the Transitional Executive Council because it had  stopped the government from giving funds to Bophuthatswana.    ""There are others not very far from you here (kwaZulu) that  are not going to get those funds for abuse ... and use to kill  innocent people.""    Mr Mandela charged that the same ""corrupt government is  steeped in the use of dirty tricks to solve its problems"",  adding that the NP in some areas of the country was involved in  the ""dirtiest campaigns"".    But the NP, he said, was not to be feared in elections  because it was a ""mouse"" and the ANc was an ""elephant"".  Referring to recent opinion polls which said the NP and  Democratic Party had made gains at the expense of the ANC, he  said: ""Even if a mouse eats very well it still remains a mouse  and an elephant remains an elephant"".    Mr Mandela said complacency among ANC supporters was to be  feared in the elections.    Urging youths at Wednesday's conference, he said, ""your task  is to work very hard ... spreading the message of liberation"".    The ANC president criticised conference delegates for not  ensuring an attendance that reflected the wider population,  which was necessary to allay the fears of minorities during a  transformation.    ""I hope at the end of this meeting you will be able to  discuss ways and means of overcoming this challenge you don't  appear to have stood up to,"" Mr Mandela said.

The meeting is the first of a  series of four meetings with Frontline leaders scheduled for  Thursday morning.    Mr Mandela said after the meeting that he had exchanged  views  with Mr Nujoma on several issues including proposed Frontline  action on the crisis in Lesotho.    Mr Nujoma said he and Mr Mandela had discussed ""bilateral  issues"". ""We have much in common particularly in terms of  trade. Over 70 percent of Namibia's trade is with South Africa  so we are good neighbours... We wanted to promote that.""    He said he and Mr Mandela also discussed the situations in  Angola, Mozambique and Rwanda. ""These are issues of great  concern to all of us. We want peace and stability because one  cannot have development where there is no peace.""    Mr Mandela also posed briefly for photographs with  Zimbabwean  President Robert Mugabe with whom he has just begun a meeting.    He is also due to meet President Ali Hassan Mwinyi of  Tanzania and Joachim Chissano of Mozambique.

He had briefed Mr Gore on the African National Congress'  Reconstruction and Development Programme which would require  ""vast resources"", Mr Mandela said.

From a $1,000-a-head reception to a march by students, admirers are expected to  flock to events in hopes of catching a glimpse or hearing the words of the  black South African activist freed just four months ago after 27 years of  imprisonment for opposing white-minority rule.    Mandela is scheduled to arrive in Los Angeles on the morning of June 29. He  leaves early the next day for Oakland, where he will stay for about 12 hours  before departing for Europe.    The 10-day U.S. tour starts in New York on June 20 and will include Boston,  Washington, Atlanta, Miami and Detroit.

In Los Angeles, Darlene Donloe, a spokeswoman for the local Mandela Reception  Committee, cautioned that many parts of Mandela's schedule are still ""up in the  air."" But the events are shaping up, tentatively, this way:    After arriving on the morning of June 29, Mandela and his entourage will  motorcade from Los Angeles International Airport to City Hall, where he will  meet with Mayor Tom Bradley and speak to the City Council. Then, Mandela will  be presented with keys to the city at a noon public ceremony on the steps of  City Hall. Aside from the motorcade, this will be the only free public access  of the day.    In the afternoon, Mandela will hold a series of private meetings at the  Biltmore, possibly with members of the local African National Congress chapter  and religious figures.    A fund-raising reception, with tickets costing anywhere from $1,000 apiece to  $50,000, will be held at the armory in Exposition Park at 7:30 p.m., while a  concert and rally at the 90,000-seat Coliseum gets under way about 8 p.m. The  event, titled the ""Mandela Freedom Celebration 1990,"" will feature Quincy Jones  and other prominent musicians. Mandela is scheduled to address the gathering at  9 p.m.    Separately, a coalition of student groups and black trade unionists plans to  march from Jackie Robinson Park along Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard to the  Coliseum to attend the rally. The march is scheduled to depart at 4:30 p.m.    Tickets for the Coliseum rally will cost $10. A Mandela hot line has been set  up to give information on where the tickets can be purchased.

He will stop at Madison Park High School in  Roxbury to give his blessing to a teach-in on the situation in South Africa for  about 1,500 youths and their parents.    A motorcade then takes him to the John F. Kennedy Library where Sen. Edward M.  Kennedy (D-Mass.) is holding a luncheon.

BUT FREED, HE COULD PROVE TO BE  A PEACEMAKER.      By ANTHONY HAZLITT HEARD, Anthony Hazlitt Heard, former editor of Cape Times in  Cape Town, South Africa, is a visiting international fellow at the Fulbright  Institute, University of Arkansas at Fayetteville.      Nelson Mandela, the world's most celebrated prisoner, was pointedly left out of  Pretoria's little list this week of those to be released from jail. The  omission will raise Mandela's stature as never before.    His colleagues and co-accused in past campaigns and court trials now walk out  of prison elderly men, like Walter Sisulu, 77, and Raymond Mhlaba, 69. This is  no doubt part of President Frederik W. de Klerk's ""equitable"" reform plan for  South Africa.    In September, De Klerk said that the goal was to reach a stage, as soon as  possible, where ""all South Africans will, in a just and equitable manner,  become part of all the decision-making processes in the country.""    Such rhetoric is the easy part. The hard part is to put flesh on the bones of  reform, and in a way that will not collapse De Klerk's already rickety white  power base. As it is, half of the Afrikaners -- the traditional strength of his  National Party -- do not support him, as the Sept. 6 general election showed.    Mandela has been in jail longer than his colleagues. He was already serving an  earlier term when he and his colleagues went to jail for life in 1964. He has,  in all, served 27 years for crimes of sabotage that he planned but did not  execute after the suppression of his African National Congress organization in  1960.    By contrast, those who opposed South African war efforts against Hitler and the  country's pro-Nazi activists were released from life imprisonment for murder or  treason in 1948, when the Afrikaner Nationalist government came to power. They,  of course, were white Afrikaners, not black nationalists, and Afrikaners were  now in charge. The justice minister at the time offered the excuse, in letting  them out, that the government wanted to forget the divisions of World War II.    If ever there was a time to forget divisions, it is now. This is particularly  so in view of De Klerk's reform talk and the fact that Mandela did not indulge  in sabotage and killing.    De Klerk's new deal will mean little while Mandela remains in jail, while the  African National Congress and its rival organization, the Pan African Congress,  remain banned, the state of emergency continues and South African exiles crowd  other shores.    It seems as if the South African government regards Mandela as too big a fish  to let loose just like that. He is obviously to be part of continuing power  plays. He may be a valuable bargaining lever in the hands of Pretoria. But with  the announcement that his colleagues are to be released, he sticks out like a  sore thumb.    An optimistic assessment would be that Pretoria is planning a wide-ranging  diplomatic push to get meaningful negotiations under way, and that Mandela will  be released when and if these are ready -- perhaps with the help of Britain's  Margaret Thatcher after the coming meeting of Commonwealth heads of government.    Those who think that Mandela is unimportant, an elderly has-been who can be  discounted, are, I believe, mistaken. Few countries' histories produce such  powerful political assets (such living martyrs) in a conflict. He is a young 70  and keeps himself fit.    The longer Mandela is in jail, the more his world and local acclaim must  increase. The government's problem is that when Mandela is released, the  acclaim will not necessarily slow down. The best they can hope is that he will  then start making the mistakes of free men. Up until now, he has been spared  this by his incarceration.    The government's incapacity to resolve the Mandela issue, for fear of the  public response when he is released, has in effect turned Mandela into the  government's jailer. I have watched over the years as Mandela's files in  newspaper libraries have grown fatter -- even rivaling those of Winston  Churchill and other notables. This has happened despite his convict status and  the fact that he could not be seen (in photographs) or heard.    Streets, rock 'n' roll groups, parks, buildings and so on are named after  Mandela in world capitals and also in South African townships and universities.  Books are written about him; films are made, statues erected.    President Pieter W. Botha, De Klerk's predecessor, was a stubborn man. He could  have let Mandela loose before his stature reached these heights. The best Botha  could do, as he left office, was to invite Mandela to tea.    The National Party government has in effect become a Mandela image-builder. It  should cut its losses. It is time for Mandela's release.

BUT FREED, HE COULD PROVE TO BE  A PEACEMAKER.      By ANTHONY HAZLITT HEARD, Anthony Hazlitt Heard, former editor of Cape Times in  Cape Town, South Africa, is a visiting international fellow at the Fulbright  Institute, University of Arkansas at Fayetteville.      Nelson Mandela, the world's most celebrated prisoner, was pointedly left out of  Pretoria's little list this week of those to be released from jail. The  omission will raise Mandela's stature as never before.    His colleagues and co-accused in past campaigns and court trials now walk out  of prison elderly men, like Walter Sisulu, 77, and Raymond Mhlaba, 69. This is  no doubt part of President Frederik W. de Klerk's ""equitable"" reform plan for  South Africa.    In September, De Klerk said that the goal was to reach a stage, as soon as  possible, where ""all South Africans will, in a just and equitable manner,  become part of all the decision-making processes in the country.""    Such rhetoric is the easy part. The hard part is to put flesh on the bones of  reform, and in a way that will not collapse De Klerk's already rickety white  power base. As it is, half of the Afrikaners -- the traditional strength of his  National Party -- do not support him, as the Sept. 6 general election showed.    Mandela has been in jail longer than his colleagues. He was already serving an  earlier term when he and his colleagues went to jail for life in 1964. He has,  in all, served 27 years for crimes of sabotage that he planned but did not  execute after the suppression of his African National Congress organization in  1960.    By contrast, those who opposed South African war efforts against Hitler and the  country's pro-Nazi activists were released from life imprisonment for murder or  treason in 1948, when the Afrikaner Nationalist government came to power. They,  of course, were white Afrikaners, not black nationalists, and Afrikaners were  now in charge. The justice minister at the time offered the excuse, in letting  them out, that the government wanted to forget the divisions of World War II.    If ever there was a time to forget divisions, it is now. This is particularly  so in view of De Klerk's reform talk and the fact that Mandela did not indulge  in sabotage and killing.    De Klerk's new deal will mean little while Mandela remains in jail, while the  African National Congress and its rival organization, the Pan African Congress,  remain banned, the state of emergency continues and South African exiles crowd  other shores.    It seems as if the South African government regards Mandela as too big a fish  to let loose just like that. He is obviously to be part of continuing power  plays. He may be a valuable bargaining lever in the hands of Pretoria. But with  the announcement that his colleagues are to be released, he sticks out like a  sore thumb.    An optimistic assessment would be that Pretoria is planning a wide-ranging  diplomatic push to get meaningful negotiations under way, and that Mandela will  be released when and if these are ready -- perhaps with the help of Britain's  Margaret Thatcher after the coming meeting of Commonwealth heads of government.    Those who think that Mandela is unimportant, an elderly has-been who can be  discounted, are, I believe, mistaken. Few countries' histories produce such  powerful political assets (such living martyrs) in a conflict. He is a young 70  and keeps himself fit.    The longer Mandela is in jail, the more his world and local acclaim must  increase. The government's problem is that when Mandela is released, the  acclaim will not necessarily slow down. The best they can hope is that he will  then start making the mistakes of free men. Up until now, he has been spared  this by his incarceration.    The government's incapacity to resolve the Mandela issue, for fear of the  public response when he is released, has in effect turned Mandela into the  government's jailer. I have watched over the years as Mandela's files in  newspaper libraries have grown fatter -- even rivaling those of Winston  Churchill and other notables. This has happened despite his convict status and  the fact that he could not be seen (in photographs) or heard.    Streets, rock 'n' roll groups, parks, buildings and so on are named after  Mandela in world capitals and also in South African townships and universities.  Books are written about him; films are made, statues erected.    President Pieter W. Botha, De Klerk's predecessor, was a stubborn man. He could  have let Mandela loose before his stature reached these heights. The best Botha  could do, as he left office, was to invite Mandela to tea.    The National Party government has in effect become a Mandela image-builder. It  should cut its losses. It is time for Mandela's release. With his standing  among blacks, and even among whites -- and his potential influence on young  black militants -- he can play a crucial peace-maker role in negotiations. The  country is fortunate that he has survived so long.      Opinion    "

King Letsie III's representatives failed to make their case to Mr Mandela and other African leaders gathered at a summit in Gaborone, Botswana. After returning from Botswana, Mr Mandela said King Letsie and Prime Minister Ntsu Mokhele would attend a meeting in South Africa tomorrow. 'We feel the government of Prime Minister Ntsu Mokhele must be reinstated and it is on this basis that we are going to have a discussion with both parties,' Mr Mandela said. Last week, Mr Mandela and President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe appeared to rule out military intervention in Lesotho. King Letsie was also facing mounting pressure at home. Lesotho businesses observed the second day of a general strike to protest against the government's dissolution. Shops were closed and school children stayed away from classes.

Mandela rises early each morning to work out on his exercise bicycle. He spends  the rest of the day reading newspapers and books, writing in his journal or  listening to radio or TV newscasts.    He has no telephone, but, for the first time since he went to prison in 1962,  he sees frequent visitors from the outside, including political associates, and  a few of them are allowed to stay for lunch.

""His spirits are marvelous,"" said Fatima Meer, his biographer, who met with  Mandela last week. ""We can all take a lesson from him. He's the one who  inspires us when we go in, not the other way around.""    Mandela turns 71 today, after the most tumultuous year of his 27 in prison, a  year in which the government launched an attempt to demythologize Mandela and  improve its own international image by slowly and publicly removing  restrictions on the leader of the outlawed African National Congress. Now  Mandela is as close as he's ever been to freedom.    A year ago, Mandela lived in a prison cell at Pollsmoor Prison in Cape Town,  where he was restricted to 40-minute visits from a handful of family and  friends. But then Mandela contracted tuberculosis, was hospitalized and, after  recuperating at a private Cape Town clinic, was transferred to a spacious house  on the grounds of Victor Verster Prison Farm here, about 40 miles from Cape  Town.    His house, usually reserved for white prison officials rather than captives,  has three bedrooms, a gymnasium, a lounge and a swimming pool with sweeping  mountain views. It's a lonely existence, but his visitation rights have been  loosened considerably. In recent weeks, for instance, he has met for hours at a  time with men the government considers dangerous figures in the ANC, Govan  Mbeki and Harry Gwala.    And more than a dozen family members, including his wife, Winnie, plan to  gather here today to celebrate his birthday.    Government officials say Mandela's release, while not possible before  September's elections, may nevertheless be only a matter of months away.    Earlier this month, Mandela was taken to the presidential mansion for tea with  the head of the white minority-led government, President Pieter W. Botha.  Although largely symbolic, their first face-to-face meeting was a reminder that  top government officials are worried about growing international pressure to  release Mandela and negotiate with the country's black leaders.    The effect of Mandela's release is the biggest unknown factor in South Africa's  future, political analysts say. Looked up to by millions of black South  Africans, Mandela is considered a unifying force among blacks -- as well as a  strong bridge between blacks and the country's fearful whites.    But conservative government officials worry that a free Mandela could trigger  unrest in the country -- particularly if the three-year-old state of emergency,  preventing most black political gatherings, and the ban on groups such as the  ANC remain in place.    Other senior officials worry that Mandela's incarceration continues to give the  world a club with which to hammer South Africa. And, those officials warn,  Mandela's death in prison would set back, perhaps irretrievably, any hope of  negotiations with the black majority in South Africa.    Mandela himself has told friends he does not expect to be freed soon.    Recent visitors say the nationalist leader, serving a life term for sabotage  and conspiracy to overthrow the government, is extremely fit, intellectually  sharp and highly conversant in current events.

Claasen, a black man who pumps gas at the service station down the road  from Victor Verster Prison, is typical of those who have never laid eyes on  Mandela.

This means that Deputy President F.W. de Klerk will have to  find a new residence.    According to information released to BEELD, Deputy President  de Klerk will occupy Overvaal, the former administrator's  residence in Pretoria.    Mr. Joel Netshitenzhe, President Mandela's spokesman,  yesterday confirmed that President Mandela had decided on  Libertas. President Mandela temporarily stayed at the  Presidency on the Bryntirion Estate while he was considering a  house in Pretoria.    Mr. Netshitenzhe said it would depend on discussions between  Mr. Mandela and Mr. de Klerk when Mr. Mandela would move into  Libertas.    It could perhaps happen around the end of the year, after  the  close of the parliamentary session, BEELD was told.    Deputy President Thabo Mbeki still lives in Johannesburg. He  is considering various options in Pretoria. One of them is  Goede Hoop, also on the Bryntirion Estate, a spokesman from his  office said.    The Presidency had earlier been the official residence of  the  state president in the days when South Africa still had a state  president and a prime minister. The prime minister then lived  at Libertas.    When President P.W. Botha became the first executive  president, he stayed on at Libertas.    The Presidency had thereafter been used as a state guest  house and a conference center.    People who have been in both say the Presidency is a  ""coldish  place with large rooms,"" while Libertas is a ""warm and  comfortable house.""    Mrs. Marike de Klerk, De Klerk's wife, helped to restore  Libertas. Earlier this year the house was declared a national  monument.     "

Addressing supporters at a rally to commemorate the SA  [South  African] Communist Party [SACP] Secretary General Chris Hani at  Orlando Stadium in Soweto on Sunday [10 April], Mr Mandela said  the Zulu king had been offered a status higher than the one he  currently enjoyed under the present kwaZulu constitution.    Mr Mandela said after King Goodwill had rejected the  proposals put forward at an emergency leadership summit at the  Kruger National Park on Friday, he had approached the Zulu  monarch and asked him ""do you want the same rights enjoyed by  (Britain's) Queen Elizabeth?""    He claimed the question had not been answered by King  Goodwill.    Turning to the security issue in kwaZulu/Natal, Mr Mandela  said the ANC fully supported the state of emergency implemented  on March 31 to restore stability in that province and to ensure  a free and fair election in the region.    Mr Mandela appealed to the masses to support police and  South  African Defence Force [SADF] actions in that region who ""have a  difficult task to ensure all people are disarmed"". He said the  purpose of security forces deployed in the province was to  protect life and property and to ensure a free and fair election  was conducted in the area.    Mr Mandela said security operations had to continue under  the  current political climate in kwaZulu/Natal and appealed to the  SADF and SA Police to ""behave in a manner which will allow us to  rely on them"". He stressed the need for confidence in these  forces who in the past had not enjoyed the support of the people  because of senior members' involvement in violence and  corruption.    The ANC leader accused State President F W de Klerk of  complicity in the violence in that region because of the  involvement of the so- called third force in fomenting the  violence. ""De Klerk is part of the massacres in that region"",  he told a wildly cheering crowd of about 8,000 supporters.    He urged the crowd to recommit themselves to peace and to  end  ""finger-pointing"" accusations for the violence in the country.  ""Each one of us must take responsibility to end crime and  violence"", he said.    In further criticising Mr de Klerk and his National Party  [NP], Mr Mandela said although recent election polls had  indicated the ANC had lost support to the NP and the Democratic  Party he again referred to the NP as a ""mouse"". ""We are dealing  with a mouse, the NP is a mouse and they think they can fight  the ANC, an elephant"". ""If a mouse overfeeds it will gain  weight, but it will remain a mouse"" he told the cheering crowd.    He noted that many South Africans were gravely concerned  about the future of the country which was going ""through a  difficult time"" and urged all South Africans to re-commit  themselves to peace.    Mr Mandela discouraged supporters from carrying weapons and  said ""neither we the ANC and the IFP should carry unlicensed  weapons to prevent the killing of innocent people"" and to ensure  a free and fair election.    Refer6ing to slain SACP secretary general who was gunned  down  by assassin Janusz Walus in his Dawn Park, Boksburg, home on  April 10 last year, Mr Mandela said Mr Hani was a ""true patriot""  who died preaching peace.    Mr Mandela told supporters the greatest tribute they could  pay to Chris Hani's memory was to elect a democratic government  in South Africa to provide ""a better life for all"". He said Mr  Hani had died an untimely death but not in vain. Mr Hani, he  said, stood for peace, democracy and justice which also  underlined the ANC's policy.    Two shots rang out as the rally ended but no incidents were  reported in Soweto west of Johannesburg during the gathering.    A police spotter plane and helicopter monitored the rally  from above and a small SADF contingent presence was maintained  directly outside the stadium. Security arrangements with the  security forces had been discussed ahead of the rally to ensure  it ran without incident.     "

It  was his first visit to Bophuthatswana since the violent clashes  and looting there last week, as well as his first ever visit to  the capital Mmabatho. Caro Kriel reports that if the ANC leader  had any doubts about his popularity in Bophuthatswana they would  have been dispelled by the huge and enthusiastic turnout of his  supporters.

That is what is going to happen in  future.    [Kriel] Earlier, Mr. Mandela visited the family of a woman  who was allegedly killed by the AWB. He also spent time at the  home of a woman whose husband died in the violence. Mr. Mandela  said he wanted to come to Bophuthatswana to speak to the people  and find out for himself what had happened. Mr. Mandela was  well received wherever he went, telling this crowd of civil  servants what they wanted to hear.    [Mandela] You are all going to get your pensions. All of you  are going to get your jobs without exception.    [Kriel] Pensions, jobs, and similar problems are now in the  hands of Bop's two coadministrators. Mr. Mandela met interim  administrator, Mr. Tjaart van der Walt, and with him Mr. Job  Mokgoro.

Inkatha central committee member and newly  appointed KwaZulu/Natal education minister Vincent Zulu said the  issue was discussed at length at the April 8 summit at Skukuza,  attended by then president F.W. de Klerk, Inkatha leader  Mangosuthu Buthelezi, Zwelithini and Mandela and their  negotiators.    ""Mandela said our demand was valid and he undertook to  discuss it with his national executive,"" Zulu said. ""He said he  would do everything possible to satisfy the king's demand.""    Mandela and Buthelezi were scheduled to meet in Cape Town  last night to discuss the growing row.    De Klerk authorised the transfer of 1.2 million hectares of  land to a trust controlled by Zwelithini on April 25.    ANC acting presidential spokesman Carl Niehaus said  yesterday  Mandela had ""nothing more"" to add until he had met Buthelezi.    Mandela said on Friday he became aware of the land deal only  on Friday after media reports. He said the ANC had not been  involved in talks on the deal.    De Klerk, speaking in London on Friday, said it was  ""nonsense"" to suggest there had been a secret deal.    Zulu said the KwaZulu government, by legislating for the  royal control of tribal land, had ""just wanted to make sure""  about the future. If government at central or provincial level  wanted to develop tribal land in KwaZulu in future, for whatever  purpose, it would have to negotiate with the king, he said.     "

He was enthusiastically received when he told the crowd that  already jobs were being created by the lifting of sanctions and  by progress made in South Africa. The National Party [NP]  federal congress this week had been paralysed by a spirit of  gloom as the party leadership had no vision. ""They say they  removed apartheid, how selfish. It is you people here and your  leaders who went to jail that forced the removal of apartheid.  The people brought an end to apartheid.""    Mr Mandela said NP was paralysed and terrified by the  rightwing. ""The rightwing started a radio station illegally,  but instead of closing them down, they went to the courts and  when they were issued a court order they went and were  frightened when the rightwing said they could not enter this  radio station.""    He said President F. W. de Klerk was frightened and had no  fighting spirit. The ANC vision of moving the country forward  had been lauded by foreign heads of state, business people and  executives of international lending organisations. ""We have  done all this, what has been done by the National Party?""    Mr Mandela said the Conservative Party [CP] was now in the  same situation as the National Party was in a few years ago.  ""The ANC was able to put the NP's fears about ANC to rest, and  we could do the same for the CP and the Freedom Alliance,"" Mr  Mandela said to loud applause.    ""The people are shunning the NP like lepers. They are still  a racist party, still clinging to racism in some way or another,  that is why their list of election candidates is predominantly  white.""    White NP members wanted to hold on to the party leadership,  this was the reason why there were so few people of colour on  the NP's list. Mr Mandela also called for the preservation of  Afrikaans. The local branch of the ANC presented Mr Mandela  with a rocking chair.    Mr Mandela left Sasolburg for Bothaville in the heart of the  wealthy maize triangle.     "

Testifying before the Legislative Yuan's Foreign Affairs  Committee, Ambassador Lu said South African President Nelson  Mandela personally assured President Li Teng-hui in May that the  South African Government under his leadership will continue its  formal ties with the ROC.    Mandela met with Li in Pretoria on May 11 after he was sworn  in as South Africa's first black president. Lu was present at  the Li-Mandela meeting.    During their 15-minute talk, Lu said, Mandela told Li not to  worry about relations between the two countries.    Mandela said his administration will follow the foreign  policy adopted by the previous white minority governments and  will continue its diplomatic ties with the ROC.    Lu quoted Mandela as stressing that unless the ROC does  something unfavorable to South Africa, Pretoria won't cut its  official ties with Taipei.    Mainland China is seeking to forge formal ties with South  Africa. It, however, wants Pretoria to first cut its ties with  the ROC.    Lu said although the new South African Government is willing  to develop ties with Beijing, it won't accept Beijing's  conditions.    The ROC has managed to improve its ties with the African  National Congress, South Africa's current ruling party, Lu said,  adding Taipei-Pretoria relations will remain solid in the years  ahead.    President Li attended Mandela's inauguration in May to  signify ROC's determination to strengthen its cooperation with  South Africa.    After his meeting with Mandela, Li told overseas Chinese  community leaders there that they can feel safe to ""do big  business"" in South Africa as Taipei-Pretoria ties will remain  strong.     "

More than 2,000 spectators in the packed General Assembly Hall, many wearing  their brightly colored native costumes, gave the deputy president of the ANC a  standing ovation.

Mandela praised the General Assembly's adoption last December of a declaration  outlining steps to be taken to dismantle apartheid, including stepped-up  economic sanctions on South Africa and financial assistance to southern African  nations.    But, he added, the world community still has ""some distance to travel"" before  the declaration would be implemented.    At a taping later of a PBS program, ""Meeting With Mandela,"" the ANC leader  defended his support of Yasser Arafat, a stance that drew criticism from major  Jewish groups in the city.

An SADF statement quoted Mr  Mandela as telling the council on February 23 that the country's  socio-economic backlog and the inability of any government to  fulfil expectations meant it was probable that a measure of  instability would persist for a number of years.    Mr Mandela expressed his appreciation of the valuable work  performed by the SADF in the interests of peace, the statement  said. He pronounced his satisfaction with the growing  credibility and acceptability of the SADF in black townships, it  added.    The statement quoted Mr Mandela as saying the ANC shared the  vision of an apolitical, professional and effective defence  force acceptable to and representative of the people of South  Africa. The national defence force should not be loyal to any  political party, including the ANC, but to the state and the  people of South Africa.    Mr Mandela said the ANC was sensitive to the position of the  commandos and would not like anything done that might alienate  them, according to the SADF statement.     "

With three  experienced presidents already trying to mediate in the conflict  it was not advisable to bring in a newcomer, he said. It had  not been possible for him to mediate in the situation because of  the large number of bilateral meetings in which he had  participated while in Tunisia for the Organisation of African  Unity's summit. However, he would like to hear what the various  Rwandan parties had to say.    Mr Mandela said the cabinet had decided to provide  humanitarian aid to Rwanda through medical assistance and funds.    South Africa had been asked to supply 50 armoured personnel  carriers with drivers to the United Nations for use in Rwanda  ""but this will have to be investigated"", the president said.    Several churches in South Africa had raised supplies for  Rwanda.    Referring to Angola, President Mandela adopted a similar  stance to that on Rwanda, saying ""as a newcomer I cannot take  over initiatives started by others"". President Joachim Chissano  of Mozambique had already assisted Angola.    Mr Mandela said he had met Mr Chissano, Angola's President  Eduardo dos Santos and President Mabuto Sese Seko of Zaire on  Wednesday. ""It seems there is a realisation that they (Angola)  should form a government of national unity,"" he said.    Intervention in Lesotho was also being investigated by a  task  force appointed to investigate the situation in that country.  ""We are discussing the matter and co-ordinating with the  secretary- general of the UN, the secretary-general of the  Commonwealth and the OAU,"" Mr Mandela said. ""As soon as our  investigations are completed we will announce the decision,"" he  said.     "

Natal has been the scene of repeated clashes between feuding supporters of the  ANC and the Inkatha movement of Zulu Chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi.

With just four days to go until the cameras beam the two  leaders into the living rooms of millions, election image-makers  on both sides have expressed jitters about the high-risk  encounter. A bad performance by either leader could cost him  thousands of vital votes from those still undecided -- perhaps  even determining whether or not the ANC will get the 66 percent  vote it needs to write the constitution on its own.    While Mr Mandela will project the image of a stately saint,  there are those in his campaign team who fear he may be too  stiff and long-winded to cope with the strict time limits. ANC  insiders believe Mr Mandela appears uncomfortable on television,  often insisting on buttoning up his jacket in the correct old  school way and failing to make eye contact with viewers by  looking into the camera.    And NP [National Party] election guru's are fearful that Mr  Mandela will launch a strong personal attack, which could  unnerve President De Klerk, who has often said he prefers  playing the ball to playing the man.    The ANC considers the debate to be the most crucial event  between the two leaders so far -- even more important than the  showdown at Codesa 1. ""It epitomises the climax of this whole  election campaign in which people will have to make a choice  between oppression and despair and democracy and a better life,""  spokesman Ronnie Mamoepa said. Mr Mamoepa said the debate had  the power to swing votes, but the ANC was confident Mr Mandela  would come out tops. ""Obviously we don't think for one split  second that our president can fluff it,"" he said.    Mr Mandela is taking seriously preparations for the debate,  leaving nothing to chance. On Wednesday, he will spend an  entire day with senior members of the National Executive  Committee being briefed on issues, and deciding which ones to  project. They will even decide on what he will wear -- dark  suit and certainly no grey shoes.    The preparations will not include matters of presentation,  apart from the cautionary plea -- ""keep it short and concise,  please Madiba"". Like all ANC candidates, Mr Mandela has already  been through a course in television technique. He has had to  undergo mock interviews in front of a television camera where a  room full of people have fired questions at the candidate. They  assess the performance later.    NP election guru Martinus van Schalkwyk is equally upbeat  about Mr De Klerk: ""He's really a natural. Of course, we will  prepare him, but because he's a natural, we won't over prepare  him,"" he says. But he would give no details on the preparation.  [passage omitted]     "

Addressing a news conference after meeting visiting Dutch  Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers and a day before crucial talks with  Inkatha Freedom Party leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi, Mr Mandela  repeated he will press ahead with efforts to bring boycotters  into the election process. But he made it clear that his crusade  would rest on two main considerations.    ""That the date set for the elections will under no  circumstances be postponed and secondly that... the sovereignty  of South Africa as a united nation must under no circumstances  be violated.""    Mr Mandela was apparently referring to demands for  self-determinatioon and for a volkstaat [homeland] by the  Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] and rightwing political groups. The  IFP is also reported to to have started moves for the election  to be postponed in kwaZulu/Natal.    ""Within that framework I am prepared to spend the rest of my  days in an attempt to persuade every South African leader to  join us,"" Mr Mandela said.    Asked whether he was optimistic about his meeting with Mr  Buthelezi on Tuesday, Mr Mandela said dialogue was the ANC's  weapon which it would employ to sway groups bent on shuning the  process. ""I approach every problem with optimism, because  dialogue is one of the most important weapons that we command,""  he said after meeting Mr Lubbers.    Touching on political violence, Mr Mandela said it was a  duty  of all South Africans to address the issue of violence to create  a proper environment for investment. The violence was creating  conditions where it was difficult to predict the economic or  political situation.    The ANC leader also said his organsiation was making  progress  in talks with rightwing organisations. He did not elaborate, but  has repeatedly said in the past that the ANC will not cave in to  demands for a volkstaat.    Mr Lubbers said he hoped ties between South Africa and his  country, which gave the ANC substantial financial and moral  support during its 30 years of anti-partheid struggle, will be  closer in the future.    Mr Mandela said Holland was one of the countries to throw  their weight behind the ANC campaign ""in the most difficult time  in our struggle"".     "

About 100,000 ANC supporters from all over Venda attended  the  rally. Mr Mandela answered their numerous questions on ANC  policy. He was asked what would become of uneducated Venda  government office cleaners -- who earn R140 [rand] a month -- if  the ANC came to power. ""All temporary government workers,  unregistered labourers and low wages will come to a halt,"" Mr  Mandela replied. Males and females with the same qualifications  would get equal pay, he added.

It appears from public statements that Mr Mandela is finding  it difficult to contain his impatience and contempt for Mr de  Klerk's handling of national affairs.    Tension between the leaders stems primarily from a  disagreement as to who should dictate the course of action to be  taken in the weekly crises that have been occurring during the  pre-election period.    It was evident two weeks ago during the crisis in  Bophuthatswana, and it showed itself again at a press conference  in Pretoria on Thursday over the impending crisis in kwaZulu.    Mr Mandela made it quite plain two weeks ago that he was not  satisfied with the agreement Mr de Klerk obtained from  Bophuthatswana's former president, Lucas Mangope, that he would  participate in the elections.    It did not follow that this implied co-operation in allowing  free and fair elections to take place, he said. He was not  satisfied, and insisted that IEC [Independent Election  Committee] chairman Judge Johann Kriegler be sent to  Bophuthatswana to secure these assurances from Mr Mangope.    As it turned out, Mr Mandela was right, and his concerns  that  Mr de Klerk dismissed so confidently were in this case justified.    Not only did Mangope start making noises that he would  renege  on his agreement on participation in the elections, but he could  not give satisfaction to Judge Kriegler that he would co-operate  with the IEC.    The handling of the crisis in kwaZulu has once again drawn  the two men together -- to argue and to disagree.    On Thursday Mr Mandela and Mr de Klerk could not agree on  the  course of action to be taken in the violence-ridden homeland.  Mr Mandela wanted swift action; Mr de Klerk wanted to hold  back a little longer.    After the meeting, Mr Mandela referred at great length to  the  attack that Mr de Klerk made on ANC secretary-general Cyril  Ramaphosa, who had called for the TEC [Transitional Executive  Council] to replace the kwaZulu government with an administrator.    ""Unfortunately, Mr de Klerk has not acted like a state  president who himself is interested in ensuring that there  should be free and fair elections in that province,"" Mr Mandela  said. ""He has acted not like a state president but like a petty  politician who is concerned with electioneering and is ignoring  major national issues facing our country.""    He also accused Mr de Klerk of refusing to address the  question that the kwaZulu government was using state funds to  destabilise the elections.    ""We regard this statement as cheap politicking, and it is  for  that reason that I think the people of South Africa are  determined to throw out the National Party in the elections,"" Mr  Mandela said.    ""I am completely disgusted,"" he continued.    ""I have refrained from handling matters in a way that will  complicate Mr de Klerk's own problems. I don't get a similar  response and cooperation from him. I totally condemn the manner  in which he is handling national issues.""    Mr de Klerk has not responded to this latest attack.     "

""They  all came together, black white, brown and yellow. That shows you what one man  can do.""    After weeks of planning, preparation, and anticipation, Nelson Mandela had come  to Los Angeles. And in less than 24 hours, Mandela was gone, off to complete  his whirlwind U.S. tour in Oakland, and then on to Ireland.    But he left some lasting impressions. The morning after he addressed 70,000  chanting, fist-waving fans in a speech at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum,  the 71-year-old activist took an early morning stroll around the Biltmore,  surrounded by a phalanx of security officers. He chatted with a few homeless  people along the way, according to hotel manager David Flack. And before  heading to the airport, Mandela shook hands and waved at the crowds who had  gathered in the hotel lobby to see him off.    Saturday, those gathered at the places near where he had stopped in Los Angeles  -- from the homeless sleeping in a square across the street from his hotel, to  a UCLA student working at the Coliseum -- talked about how his presence had  made them feel, and what impact, if any, his historic visit would have on their  city.    Douglas Brown, 30, said Mandela's impact was tangible.    ""I know South-Central Los Angeles, for one day, had a sense of pride,"" said  Brown, the swimming pool manager at Rancho Cienega Park, the meeting place for  hundreds of students who marched to the Coliseum Friday in honor of Mandela and  the anti-apartheid struggle.    ""There were people in the park yesterday who traditionally don't get along but  yesterday they weren't going to ruin that moment,"" said Brown, referring to  different sets of gang members who came to the park. ""They didn't have their  jeans hanging down, their rags hanging out. For that day they had on Mandela  shirts. You couldn't tell what set anybody was from.""    But the fact remained that a surprisingly small crowd -- estimated by some to  be no more than 4,000 people -- turned out to greet Mandela in Los Angeles'  Civic Center, less than the number of people who gathered to see him last week  in a Brooklyn schoolyard.    It's apathy, said 68-year-old James Thomas, a retired city employee. ""Folks  just don't care, and those who do often take care of strangers before they take  care of home.    ""The people want to donate money for the cause over there quicker than they'll  donate to a cause here,"" said Thomas, as he sat on a park bench near the  Coliseum, musing and munching on an ice-cream cone.    Mandela ""is working for better conditions for his people in his homeland, see,""  said Brown, who added that he supported his efforts. But ""the way I look at it,  there ain't too much he can do for the people here.""    Kimberly Menefee, 30, sat on the City Hall lawn with her boyfriend and said she  thought people would be inspired -- but only for an hour or two. ""They ain't  going to care after that. People can talk a lot of stuff but they don't always  want to act on it when the time comes.""    But Deron Thompson, a 23-year-old UCLA student working at the Coliseum said he  had never seen so many people inspired as he did sitting amid the assembled  crowd that had come to hear Mandela speak.    ""It's something you can always look on and say 'I was there,' "" said Thompson  who attended Mandela's Coliseum speech with his sister and a group of friends.  ""You could feel the energy. I think it'll make people go out and do something,  change things. It just lifted them to hear what he was saying.""

Alfred Nzo, general secretary of the ANC, said Thursday that he spoke to  Mandela for the first time in 26 years Tuesday night.    ""I know his voice.

Joseph resumed her anti-apartheid activities after the trial but was placed  under police restrictions, including house arrest, for most of the 1960s and  1970s.

He is also due to meet Conservative Party [CP]  leader Dr Ferdi Hartzenberg at midday and Freedom Front leader  Gen Constand Viljoen later in the day.    Emerging from his official Tuynhuys offices flanked by the  nine premiers and second deputy president Mr F W de Klerk, Mr  Mandela said there was a need for him and the provincial leaders  to exchange views. ""We will listen to people ourselves; our  style is one of intensive consultation. The agenda is going to  come from such meetings,"" Mr Mandela said.    An earlier statement from the Tuyhhuys said the meeting with  the premiers would include matters such as the relationship  between the central government and the provincial  administrations, and relevant constitutional matters. Also of  importance were the implementation of programmes for  reconstruction and development.    Mr Mandela, who is to meet Dr Hartzenberg about midday at  his  official residence Westbrooke, said he was due to meet Gen  Viljoen later on Wednesday. This followed their meeting on  Friday and another between Mr de Klerk and the Freedom Front  leader. Mr Mandela said he was prepared to listen to Gen  Viljoen in what he called a preliminary discussion.    The Conservative Party had also indicated it wanted to raise  certain issues with the government, including the question of  amnesty of 32 Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging [Afrikaner Resistance  Movement] members implicated in pre-election bomb blasts. Other  CP concerns included a licence for Radio Pretoria and the  question of the ""volkstaat"" [Afrikaner homeland].     "

By SCOTT KRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER      JOHANNESBURG, South Africa      Nelson R. Mandela and four anti-apartheid leaders dined on steak, fries and  politics in his prison house one evening early this month, then repaired to the  lounge and switched on the government's nightly news.    When the newscaster announced the decision to free several of Mandela's closest  colleagues from prison, a look of satisfaction crossed the face of the  71-year-old leader, according to those present.    ""Mr. Mandela,"" the newscaster added, ""was fully apprised of the decision.""    ""I'm looking forward to the best sleep of my life,"" Mandela told his dinner  guests.    That extraordinary dinner party in Mandela's house on the grounds of a prison  farm near Cape Town, and Mandela's clearly crucial role in pressing the  government to free his associates after a quarter century in jail, illustrate  the considerable power and influence that the aging leader of the outlawed  African National Congress is wielding today from prison.    Mandela, who has not been seen or heard publicly for 27 years, is not running  the anti-apartheid struggle from inside prison, nor has he entered negotiations  with the government. But to a remarkable extent, he has been able to maintain a  dialogue with the government and apply pressure on it to release political  prisoners and accept the ANC as a force it cannot ignore in South Africa's  future.    Mandela has gained a larger-than-life status while in prison, and millions of  blacks, most born after he went on trial for treason and sabotage in 1963,  consider him their true leader. Upon meeting him for the first time, visitors  are often struck by his booming voice and regal bearing.    ""When you are in the room with him, you sense you are with a person of unique  greatness,"" said Cyril Ramaphosa, leader of the National Union of Mineworkers.  ""He has a magnetic presence.""    The government moved Mandela last year to a three-bedroom house, ordinarily  reserved for prison officials, on prison grounds in lush wine country. He  cannot place or receive phone calls, but his jailers have allowed him  increasing numbers of visitors, frequently over lunch or dinner, and placed no  time restrictions on those visits.    At Mandela's request, four leaders of the Mass Democratic Movement, a newly  formed coalition of the country's leading anti-apartheid groups, came for  dinner Oct. 10, the night the government announced that it would release  Mandela's closest confidant, Walter Sisulu, and seven others.    The delegation, including Ramaphosa, Sisulu's wife, Albertina, Murphy Morobe  and Cassim Saloojee, arrived about 6 p.m., minutes after Sisulu and several  other inmates had ended a five-hour visit.    Saloojee said he found it ""grandly exciting"" but also ""a weird experience"" to  be sitting in a comfortable home behind prison fences and being served dinner  by a white guard who called Mandela ""sir.""    Mandela, dressed in a suit and tie and looking fit, cautioned them that their  conversations might be overheard.    ""You must assume we are not alone,"" he said.    Nevertheless, the guests recalled later, everyone spoke fairly freely,  discussing the seriousness of the government's pledge to negotiate with black  leaders and the successful defiance campaign launched in August by the Mass  Democratic Movement. Mandela praised the MDM campaign and disclosed that the  government intended to free the senior ANC leaders.    ""He had told us about the releases, but when we heard it on television it made  the whole thing so real,"" said Saloojee, president of the Transvaal Indian  Congress. ""We could feel he was deeply moved. He hugged Ma Sisulu. It was a  great moment for him because he knew he had played a role.""    Earlier in the evening, Mandela had read to them from his own handwritten  document, outlining his thoughts on the current challenges facing the black  liberation struggle. None of the visitors would reveal the contents of that  document, but Saloojee said it showed Mandela to be ""remarkably well-informed.  His knowledge of what is happening in the country was such that you would not  believe he had been cut off for all these years.""    Senior government officials have been paying Mandela private visits since  before 1982, when he was moved from Robben Island to Pollsmoor Prison. In  recent months, he has met many times with Justice Minister Kobie Coetsee and  Constitutional Development Minister Gerrit Viljoen, whom President Frederik W.  de Klerk has appointed to get negotiations going with the black majority.    Being in jail has put Mandela in a unique position to talk with the government,  which refuses to meet publicly with leaders of the ANC in exile until the  guerrilla group renounces violence or at least expresses a commitment to a  peaceful solution in South Africa.    Mandela told his visitors that the meetings were an attempt to persuade the  government to release its political prisoners and negotiate with the ANC  leaders in exile. Anti-apartheid sources say he entered into no agreements with  the government about his colleagues' release and made no promises about how  they might behave once they were free.    The government's decision to release Sisulu and the others was welcomed in  world capitals and was widely seen as an effort to buy time for De Klerk's  reform program and test the waters for Mandela's own release.    Mandela said he made no promises about how his fellow ANC leaders would behave  once they were free, but he had told government officials that the released men  would need to meet current leaders of the ANC in exile, as well as internal  leaders, to seek their orders.    So far, the freed prisoners have stressed the need for ""order and discipline""  in the anti-apartheid movement and sought to defuse potential clashes with the  authorities. The police, meanwhile, have allowed the ANC leaders considerable  latitude, effectively lifting the 29-year ban on the organization.    Mandela said his own release is not an issue under consideration now, while 400  people remain jailed for political crimes, 15 of them like himself serving life  sentences. Government officials have said Mandela may be released sometime next  year.    ""The release of his colleagues has always been paramount in his mind,"" said  Morobe, acting publicity secretary of the United Democratic Front. ""He sees  himself as having an obligation to them.""    When Mandela is released, anti-apartheid leaders say, he will not fade into the  background as an aging elder statesman.    ""From the way he thinks and discusses things, I believe he has an enormous role  to play in shaping the future,"" Saloojee said. ""He's going to make quite an  impact as the leader of the ANC.""      Photo, Freed black leader Walter Sisulu, left, shares delight of wife,  Albertina, on her 72nd birthday as Archbishop Desmond M.

They are in  the country for Mr Mandela's inauguration in Pretoria on  Tuesday. The three men posed for a photograph at the presidency  in Pretoria where they held talks. Mr Weizman presented Mr  Mandela with a silver-plated scripture, called a Tanach in  Hebrew.    Outside at an impromptu press conference, Mr Weizman said Mr  Mandela had promised him and Mr 'Arafat he would visit their  countries [as received]. Mr Arafat said they had had ""very  important discussions"".    Mr Weizman and Mr 'Arafat were among a string of dignitaries  who met Mr Mandela on Monday. British foreign secretary douglas  hurd was the first. After his talks with Mr Mandela, Mr Hurd  said the president-elect was full of plans and ideas for the  future. He said he had told Mr Mandela Britain was anxious and  keen to provide assets or experience that could be useful to  South Africa.    Other dignitaries to visit Mr Mandela were former Australian  prime ministers Mr Bob Hawke and Mr Malcolm Fraser.    Scheduled to visit Mr Mandela on Monday night were  representatives of a selected Commonwealth group, including  Canadian deputy prime minister Ms Sheila Copps, Malaysian  minister of foreign affairs Mr Abdullah bin Haji Ahmad Badawi,  Singaporean minister of finance Dr Richard Hu and Sri Lankan  Minister of Foreign Affairs Mr A C S Hameed.    The southern African group included Botswanan President  Quett  Masire, Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, Mozambican President  Joachim Chissano, Angolan President Eduardo dos Santos, Namibian  President Sam Nujoma, Zambian President Frederick Chiluba,  Basotho King Letsie III and Swazi King Mswati III.    Most leaders and heads-of-state presented mr mandela with  gifts.    The South African Communications Service said in a statement  on Monday night King Constantine of Greece was in South Africa  in his private capacity, and not to represent the Hellenic  Republic of Greece. ""Neither is he a member of the Greek  delegation attending the inauguration of President Mandela,  despite press reports to the contrary,"" the statement said.     "

Answering questions at the World Economic Forum  conference in Cape Town, he said in terms of privatisation,  people with capital were advantaged -- that is, ""not blacks,  only whites"".    The ""democratic government"" would therefore be deprived of  resources.    ""This (privatisation) is not seen here in the same way as in  Switzerland,"" Mr Mandela added to laughter.    The privatisation of such assets as airports and harbours  ""cannot be in the interests of the masses of the people"".    Asked whether he was prepared to give a glimpse into the  June  22 budget, Mr Mandela said to more laughter that he did not want  to ""take you into confidence"" but that he was sure the minister  of finance, Mr Derek Keys -- who was present at the conference  -- ""will be pleased to answer"".

AFRICA, ANC TO RESCHEDULE STALLED TALKS      By SCOTT KRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER      CAPE TOWN, South Africa      In discussions between South Africa's two most important opponents, President  Frederik W. de Klerk and African National Congress Deputy President Nelson R.  Mandela agreed Thursday night to reschedule talks that had been suspended by  the ANC in protest over police killings of black demonstrators.    The peace process ""is on course again,"" De Klerk declared after a three-hour  meeting with Mandela at the presidential offices. It was the first formal  contact between a free ANC leader and a South African president in at least  three decades.    Mandela, at a separate news conference, described the meeting as ""cordial,  pleasant . . . and productive. We think, broadly speaking, we have been able to  make very good progress and we are hopeful further meetings also will be  productive.""    Mandela and De Klerk, each assisted by three senior aides, agreed on a new date  for initial ANC-government talks. The ANC said the date will be announced as  soon as Mandela reports back to the ANC's national executive committee in  Lusaka, Zambia.    The two sides also agreed to open formal channels of communication that would,  in De Klerk's words, ""eliminate misunderstandings"" between the ANC and the  government in the future. Neither De Klerk nor Mandela would specify what those  arrangements entailed.    The ANC's efforts to unify anti-apartheid forces for eventual negotiations also  were bolstered Thursday when four of the six leaders of South Africa's  self-governing black homelands pulled out of separate talks with De Klerk, and  the leader of one of the country's four nominally independent black homelands,  Venda, was overthrown in a military coup.    Only two homeland leaders -- Kwazulu chief minister Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi  and Qwaqwa chief minister Kenneth Mopeli -- turned up for their scheduled  meeting with De Klerk. The government accused the ANC of intimidating the other  homeland leaders, and De Klerk criticized Mandela, saying that ""no leader  should in any way whatsoever try to inhibit discussion.""    ""There is no way I'm going to be intimidated by any bullying,"" said Buthelezi,  whose supporters have been engaged in a bloody war with the ANC-aligned United  Democratic Front in Natal province. And Buthelezi said that ""just because I'm  here,"" meeting with De Klerk, doesn't mean ""I'm aligning myself with the  government.""    Mandela denied any ANC intimidation of the homeland leaders, contending that  the four leaders had already made up their minds to boycott talks with De Klerk  when they briefed the ANC on Wednesday.    The resurrected government-ANC talks, originally scheduled for next Thursday,  will center on obstacles to formal negotiations. The ANC has refused to accept  De Klerk's invitation to negotiate a new constitution until the government  lifts the 46-month-old state of emergency, releases political prisoners, ends  political prosecutions and allows exiles free passage home.    The ANC, the primary black opposition group in South Africa, had suspended  arrangements for those preliminary talks in protest over a March 26 clash  between police and demonstrators in Sebokeng, about 25 miles south of  Johannesburg. Police opened fire on tens of thousands of blacks protesting poor  living conditions in that township, killing five. At least 10 other deaths  occurred in rioting and additional clashes with police later that day.    The ANC had demanded a government response to the ""massacre of innocent and  defenseless people in Sebokeng.""    De Klerk met that demand Thursday by assuring Mandela that he had already  ordered ""an in-depth investigation"" into the police actions in Sebokeng. The  president also said he would consider appointing a judicial commission of  inquiry into the deaths.    Mandela said he welcomed De Klerk's moves but added that he had told the  president that any commission of inquiry ""must consist of people regarded as  credible leaders"" in the black community. ""The perception that exists,  especially among blacks in the country, is that a white judge is not the right  person to head such an inquiry.""    It was the first meeting of the two leaders since Mandela was released from  prison Feb. 11. They conferred twice while Mandela was a prisoner.    Mandela was joined in the discussions by Popo Molefe, general secretary of the  UDF anti-apartheid coalition; Trevor Manuel, ANC leader in the western Cape  province, and Ahmed Kathrada, a Mandela co-defendant in the 1964 treason trial  and now part of the ANC's internal leadership.    De Klerk was assisted by Roelof F. (Pik) Botha, the foreign minister; Gerrit  Viljoen, minister of constitutional development, and Adriaan Vlok, minister of  law and order.    The two sides agreed that escalating violence across the country, especially in  Natal province where factional fighting has claimed more than 2,500 lives in  the last three years, is a major impediment to fruitful black-white  negotiations.    But they disagreed about the cause of that violence. De Klerk suggested that  much of it was spawned by the ANC's refusal to end its support for the armed  struggle it has waged against Pretoria's white minority-led government for 30  years.    The ANC contends that the armed struggle cannot be ended until the government  stops using violence against anti-apartheid demonstrators. And Mandela blamed  the violence in South Africa on the system of racial repression that has left  the black majority impoverished and frustrated.    The government's desire to open power-sharing talks with black opposition  groups has triggered increasing violence in South Africa's 10 homelands, which  were created under apartheid to keep blacks away from white areas. Many  residents of the four homelands that Pretoria considers independent are  pressing their leaders to return the territories to South African rule.    A coup last month toppled the leader of Ciskei, one of the four independent  homelands. And on Thursday, Venda President Frank Ravele, the leader of another  of those independent homelands, was overthrown.    News of the coup was greeted with singing and dancing in the streets, news  agencies reported. In an address on Radio Thohoyandou, coup leader Col. Gabriel  Ramushwana, deputy chief of the Venda Defense Force, said he would lead the  2,578-square-mile territory until it is incorporated into South Africa.    ""It is quite clear these (homeland) leaders have no support,"" Mandela said. And  while the ANC is willing to forget the past, he warned that ""discredited  homeland leaders"" who are attempting to maintain their power despite public  disapproval ""will not be able to run to us for protection.""

He said the service in the  Catholic Church for the slain communist leader showed the  importance of the Church in the struggle for change in South  Africa. He said Mr Hani had been one of South Africa's most  important revolutionaries.    Outside the church, Mr Mandela addressed about 300 people.

ANC supporters formed a guard of honour outside the church  where they hoped to catch a glimpse of Mr Mandela as he left the  church grounds. The group of about 400 men were armed with  traditional weapons and stood silently with their fists raised  in a black power salute on either side of the road. The armed  men were dressed with sheets and blankets under which many of  them hid their weapons. They were reportedly from surrounding  squatter settlements on the East Rand.    Peace monitors and ANC marshals formed a human chain between  the men and the middle of the road through which the Mandela  convoy was expected to travel.     "

At the second stop of his western Transvaal campaign  trail, the ANC leader told a crowd at Stilfontein that his  organisation had made the Afrikaner's an offer they would be  foolish to refuse. Rightwingers could have their own separate  election ballot to vote for a volkstaat [homeland]. But, the  ultimate decision on the establishment of such a homeland would  be made by the government voted into power.    Mr Mandela further warned rightwingers not to do anything to  plunge the country into a conflict that would leave many, both  black and white, dead. ""We know how to fight too,"" Mr Mandela  said.    From one packed stadium to the next, Mandela kept up a  hectic  schedule on Sunday. Despite being a poor community, residents  at the next stop at Jouberton Township outside Klerksdorp went  all out to welcome him. Here, his message of proper housing and  services, education, health care and employment for the masses  drew an enthusiastic response.    Mr Mandela said no matter how much money and effort the ANC  poured into uplifting poverty-stricken communities by creating  jobs and giving children a free education, the people themselves  had to work hard and be dedicated to improving their lot. He  said the ANC's national public works programme would not only  give people jobs, but allow the community to be part of a  labour-intensive project of building facilities like homes,  clinics, hospitals and roads.    Mr Mandela warned, however, that changes would not be  noticeable in the first few years after elections. ""Do not  expect to be driving a Mercedes the day after the elections.  You must have patience. You might have to wait five years for  results to show. But, we will immediately begin mobilising  resources and implementing plans,"" he said.    Throughout the day, Mandela appealed to people to allow the  National Party to campaign freely in the townships. ""We want  you to give all organisations a chance to canvass support in the  townships. Let them come and show they have nothing to offer  you. They will only expose themselves. We will not have to  bury them after elections. They are burying themselves,"" he  said.     "

Grasping the full significance  of the effects of a ""truth commission"", the THE STAR states that  ""embarrassing is hardly the word for the effect of a truth  commission: it could wreck the reputation and careers of many;  it will be painful for all; and it will be a searing experience  for families of the victims.

""In this respect the judge in  the Falati-Mandela case has done South Africa a service."" ""This  is undoubtedly a landmark decision. In a society subjected to  autocratic abuse for decades, the ground rules need to be  clearly redefined."" ""The judge has given credence to a view  long held by the press: there are cases where private interests  must yield to public interest.""

""There is obviously no better qualified person than  Keys to present a `transition' Budget under the most  extraordinary circumstances. Contradictions and dilemmas  abound. While he is a `hangover' from the old order and is  beholden to the eclipsed minority National Party, he now answers  to a representative government of national unity."" ""Keys'  difficult challenge is to put forward a practical fiscal plan  able to address the interests and concerns of diverse  constituencies."" The importance of economic growth is conceded  but the editorial laments certain attitudes that throw this  concern into the debate on the Reconstruction and Development  Plan. ""It's the haves telling the have-nots changes in their  lives are only possible if the wealth of the wealthy remains  untouched. The ANC in particular has been guilty of appeasement  and underplaying the price that all South Africans will have to  pay to fix the damage caused by apartheid. Keys' message today  needs to be blunt and unambiguous -- there will be a lot of pain  before there's gain and the sooner we get on with it, the  better.""     "

In Detroit, anti-apartheid activists are attempting to secure 52,000-seat Tiger  Stadium for Mandela to address an expected overflow crowd. New Yorkers are  organizing two speeches -- one at the United Nations and another at 68,000-seat  Yankee Stadium -- plus a ticker-tape parade through downtown Manhattan. In Los  Angeles, a squabble has already occured over control of Mandela's schedule. In  Boston, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) has reserved the John F. Kennedy  presidential library for a luncheon; a public reception is expected in Boston  Commons.    And here, in the nation's capital, Mandela will cruise from a private audience  with President Bush at the White House to star-studded fund-raising dinners to  political conferences with well connected lawmakers. Organizers say an  appearance at RFK Stadium or the Lincoln Memorial also is being discussed.    Hidden from public view for 27 years by South African prison walls, Mandela  stepped squarely into the international spotlight with his release on Feb. 11.  Now, as word spreads of his journey to America, liberating expectations combine  with racial tensions as municipal officials prepare to welcome and protect one  of the world's greatest living heroes.    Mandela, deputy president of the African National Congress and the focal point  of the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa, is expected to meet President  Bush at the White House on June 25 and to visit Los Angeles on June 29 and 30.  Other stops are planned in New York, Boston, Atlanta, Miami and Detroit.    Organizers of Mandela's American visit are scrambling to find places deep and  wide enough to hold the anticipated thousands who will pay to see -- and be  seen -- during his historic visit. Some are comparing the coming of Mandela to  the much publicized visit of Pope John Paul II to nine U.S. cities in 1987.    ""Mandela will get the kind of treatment the Pope got,"" said Bill Owens, a  Massachusetts state senator and a leading figure in Boston's black communities.  ""For all intents and purposes, Nelson Mandela is more than a head of state. He  is, perhaps, the most well-known person in the world right now.""    For millions of Americans, including an overwhelming number of black Americans,  Mandela's struggle against the South African government has made him a world  leader of almost mythic proportion. His seven-city U.S. tour will take him to  urban areas with large black populations and, in some cases, severe racial  tensions. Five of the seven cities have black mayors. While local officials so  far have played down the possibility that Mandela's visit could spark  confrontations, they acknowledge that his presence is likely to evoke powerful  emotional outbursts among both blacks and whites, particularly at large outdoor  rallies.    Since the ""Free South Africa"" protests in 1984 focused attention in this  country on the racially segregationist policies of the South African  government, Americans have identified increasingly with Mandela's cause.    Although the turnout will be difficult to predict until his schedule is  completed, each of Mandela's public appearances in the United States could  attract tens of thousands of participants and create scenes reminiscent of the  historic civil rights rallies of the 1960s.    In what was seen as an early indication of the likely U.S. reaction to his  presence, Mandela attended a rock concert in his honor at London's Wembley  Stadium before more than 70,000 admirers who paid $33 each for their tickets.  When Mandela rose to speak, the overflow crowd of blacks and whites,  celebrities and commoners, sat in awe-struck silence.    Already, organizers of his visit to the United States are preparing for an  onslaught of people who hope to meet with him or use his celebrity to enhance  their causes.    ""Everybody wants to shake his hand,"" said Roger Wilkins, coordinator of the  Mandela Reception Committee, which is supervising Mandela's lodging, travel and  social engagements in concert with the African National Congress; TransAfrica,  an anti-apartheid lobby, and Fenton Communications, a Washington public  relations firm.    ""Since people found out I have this job, I've gotten so many calls from new  friends, all people who want to participate some way or meet him,"" said  Wilkins.    Describing Mandela as ""a very, very valuable 71-year-old human being,"" Wilkins  said the planning of his U.S. itinerary would be supervised through the  committee's Washington office. Local officials in each of the host cities are  making arrangements and recommendations for activities in the respective  locations, he said.    A small dispute erupted last week in Los Angeles, where the local ANC office  expressed dismay at the announcement of the Wilkins group's control of  Mandela's schedule. Responding to the concerns of the Los Angeles ANC chapter,  the reception committee issued a statement affirming its duties as the sole  ""organizing body for the visit.""    Nevertheless, some local confusion and apprehension have become evident amid  the excitement surrounding Mandela's impending visit.    For example, the chief source of controversy arising from Mandela's planned  one-day stop in Detroit on June 28 is who gets the credit for his Motown visit.  Mayor Coleman A. Young said it was his invitation that swayed Mandela; a group  of Baptist ministers who traveled to South Africa this spring said it was their  appeal that persuaded Mandela to visit Detroit; United Auto Workers officials  claimed it was the union's longstanding solidarity with the struggle of black  South Africans that tipped the scales.    ""The people involved in the process have all worked together on so many things  that we don't anticipate much conflict,"" said Bob Berg, Young's chief  spokesman. ""The whole idea of his being here is a celebration of what he stands  for and a chance for people of Detroit and Michigan and the surrounding states  to show their support for the fight for freedom in South Africa.""    For Young, however, the planned visit has revived a source of antagonism  between the mayor and many of his black critics involving disclosures of  Young's investments in South African Krugerrands. Young has disavowed any  direct involvement in purchasing the gold coins, which were acquired by an  investment firm created solely for Young's benefit.    Though growing tensions between Miami's black and expanding Latino communities  exploded into rioting in 1987 and 1988, Alvin Peabody, an assistant to Miami  Mayor Xavier Suarez, said the city will ensure tight security for Mandela's  visit to City Hall.    ""If they do have intentions to disrupt Mandela's time here, our organizers will  make sure they are not seen or heard,"" Peabody said. However, he called Mandela  ""a hero for all people"" and predicted he would be ""a unifying force for people  of all colors in America.""    Boston Mayor Raymond L. Flynn assured anti-apartheid activists that he would  assist their efforts to celebrate Mandela by providing city-donated parade  permits, police overtime and other necessary resources. ""What the mayor said  was, you tell us what you want, and we're here to help,"" said Arthur Jones, an  assistant to Flynn.    In New York, a series of recent racial incidents have heightened tensions among  the city's minority population groups. Even so, Wilbert Tatum, editor of the  Amsterdam News, the city's largest black-owned newspaper, doubted that the  recent troubles would affect Mandela's visit.    ""If friction does come at all,"" he said, ""it will be about who is to sit on the  right hand of God, and nothing more.""    Tatum said he believed that New York's sometimes-divided black community would  display unprecedented unanimity in its reaction to the visit, citing a near  universal agreement about the need to offer ""a real American outpouring of love  and money for Mandela.""    Wilkins, the Mandela Reception Committee coordinator, said the U.S. tour is  designed to allow Mandela to request U.S. financial support for the ANC and to  persuade government officials and private individuals to assist in ending  apartheid.    ""We are committed to putting together a program that is designed to help him  accomplish his objectives,"" Wilkins said, noting that the organizers will not  allow groups to exploit Mandela for selfish purposes:    ""Nelson Mandela is not a moveable photo opportunity to inflate the ego of  Americans and American institutions.""

From Times Wire Services      GENEVA      South African black nationalist leader Nelson Mandela has rejected all forms of  anti-Semitism and recognized Israel's right to exist within secure borders, the  head of a U.S. Jewish delegation that met with Mandela said Sunday.    Members of the Jewish delegation said their meeting with Mandela exceeded their  ""fondest expectations,"" even though they said he called for direct talks  between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization and urged Israel to  surrender the occupied territories. They said Mandela should be warmly welcomed  when he visits the United States beginning June 20.    Henry Siegman, executive director of the American Jewish Congress, told  journalists after the 2 1/2-hour meeting that Mandela said his African National  Congress ""accepts unequivocally the existence of the state of Israel, not only  de facto but also its legal right to exist . . . within secure borders.""    Several U.S. Jewish groups recently said they would protest Mandela's visit to  the United States because he had compared the struggle of Palestinians to that  of black South Africans and publicly embraced PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat.    The Jewish delegation made a special trip to Geneva to seek clarification of  Mandela's positions.    Siegman said the meeting, which lasted 90 minutes longer than expected, put an  end to the concerns, even though the Jewish delegation disagreed with Mandela's  views on talks between Israel and the PLO.    Siegman said the ANC deputy president criticized the Israeli government's  treatment of Palestinians and called on Jerusalem to hold direct talks with the  PLO to settle the 30-month-old Palestinian uprising in the territories occupied  by Israel.    Speaking at a news conference, Siegman quoted Mandela as saying that Israel's  borders should not encompass the Golan Heights, the Gaza Strip and the West  Bank, which were captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East War.    Mandela's views are certain to be unpopular with the new right-wing government  now being formed in Israel. It opposes any territorial concessions to the  Palestinians and favors pursuing a peace plan that would give only limited  autonomy to the 1.7 million Palestinians in the occupied lands.    Nevertheless, Siegman, who coordinated the visit of the Jewish leaders to  Geneva, said the Jewish community should ""join actively and vigorously in  extending a warm welcome"" to Mandela during his 10-day U.S. visit.    He said Mandela would welcome an opportunity to visit Israel if invited by the  government.    Siegman said Mandela was ""extraordinarily forthcoming and enthusiastic"" at the  private meeting, held at a secret location. ANC representatives could not  immediately be contacted for comment.    ""I will probably raise my voice and proclaim he (Mandela) is a friend,"" said  Abraham Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai  B'rith.

The American Jewish Congress, National Jewish Community Relations Advisory  Council, American Jewish Committee, Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith and  Union of American Hebrew Congregations were represented at the meeting.    Meanwhile, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that a tip from the CIA to  South African authorities led to Mandela's arrest in 1962.    The newspaper quoted an anonymous retired ""former intelligence officer"" for the  United States as saying that a senior American intelligence operative in South  Africa told him of the spy agency's role in helping South African police arrest  Mandela on Aug. 5, 1962.    The paper quoted the unidentified source as saying there was no reason for  continued secrecy about a CIA role in the black leader's arrest for plotting to  overthrow white-minority rule since the ANC deputy president was released from  prison last February.    Within hours of Mandela's arrest near Durban, the source said he was told of  the agency's role by Paul Eckel, described as a senior CIA operative in South  Africa. Eckel moved to Atlanta after retiring and died in 1986.    The unidentified source said Eckel told him that the CIA's information on  Mandela's whereabouts had come from a paid informant.

The newspaper quoted an anonymous retired ""former intelligence officer"" for the  United States as saying that a senior American intelligence operative in South  Africa told him of the spy agency's role in helping South African police arrest  Mandela on Aug. 5, 1962.    The paper quoted the unidentified source as saying there was no reason for  continued secrecy about a CIA role in the black leader's arrest for plotting to  overthrow white-minority rule since the ANC deputy president was released from  prison last February.    Within hours of Mandela's arrest near Durban, the source said he was told of  the agency's role by Paul Eckel, described as a senior CIA operative in South  Africa. Eckel moved to Atlanta after retiring and died in 1986.    The unidentified source said Eckel told him that the CIA's information on  Mandela's whereabouts had come from a paid informant.

Addressing about 8,000 enthusiastic  supporters at Dal Josaphat stadium in Paarl in the Western Cape,  he said opinion polls had consistently shown that the ANC was  the most popular organisation in the country and that it would  win an outright victory if an election were held now.    ""The party that follows us in comparative strength is  nothing  more than a Mickey Mouse. But the greatest danger to democracy  is you, the supporters of the ANC."" Mr Mandela said the ANC had  to ensure that every one of its supporters would be able to vote  and to achieve that, activists had to work very hard.    Earlier the ANC leader praised Justice Minister Kobie  Coetsee, saying Mr Coetsee had had ""the courage and vision"" to  initiate discussions between himself and former President P W  Botha while Mr Mandela was still in Victor Verster Prison.    Mr Mandela also thanked the community of Paarl for their  support while he was held at Victor Verster and praised a number  of white warders who had treated him with sensitivity and  kindness.    The ANC leader was wildly applauded when he arrived at the  packed stadium and circled the track on the back of a bakkie  [pickup truck] waving to the crowd. Mr Mandela was presented  with a symbolic freedom torch which had been lit outside Victor  Verster prison on Wednesday morning and carried to the stadium  by runners.    Crowds lined the streets of Paarl and many shops were closed  as the ANC leader's entourage passed through the town on its way  to the stadium.     "

HE URGES  HOLLYWOOD TO USE TALENTS TO MAKE WORLD A BETTER PLACE.      By PATT MORRISON and JOCELYN STEWART, TIMES STAFF WRITERS      Nelson Mandela, who spoke earlier in the day of his youthful dreams of  Hollywood, met with nearly 1,000 of the entertainment capital's legends Friday  night in a star-studded dinner and reception that swelled the coffers of his  South African causes.    ""I feel humbled in this room,"" he told the crowd of celebrities, many of whom  had waited as long as four hours to hear him speak, ""and honored by your  presence.""    In an affectionate address that touched repeatedly on the films he saw as a  youth -- and later as a political prisoner -- Mandela told his audience that  ""you were our window on life outside.""    He urged them to fight against apartheid, saying: ""In this fight we would like  all of you to be on our side. With you on our side, we are certain of victory.  Let us use our creative talents, potential and influence to make our world a  better place to live in.""    And gently chiding the film industry for its early portrayals of black Africans  as savages, Mandela said he was encouraged by more recent cinematic attempts to  humanize the image and publicize the South African struggle.    ""As a young man,"" he said, ""I remember seeing the films of Tarzan, and being  uneasy and disturbed . . . . Fortunately over the past few years, a few films  have sought to partially redress this injustice.""    He added that ""it is a damning indictment of apartheid that so many years after  Sidney Poitier starred in the film, 'Cry the Beloved Country, our beloved  country is still crying.""    Poitier was among the 960 actors, film makers, entrepreneurs, politicians and  activists in attendance at perhaps the most ambitious fund-raising event in  Mandela's eight-city tour of the United States.    The ""take"" for the event was more than $1.2 million, organizers said. And most  of it came from the entertainment industry.    Music producer and composer Quincy Jones, who contributed $100,000 to the  cause, described the long years that Mandela spent in South African jails as a  harsh payment that most of those in attendance could never fully understand.    ""He's put his life and his soul on the line for what he believes in,"" Jones  said as he arrived several hours before Mandela's appearance. ""I don't know how  many -- even in this crowd -- would go to prison for 27 years for what they  believe in.""    Mandela strode into the armory of the Museum of Science and Industry at 9 a.m.,  proceeding down a red carpet with an entourage that included his wife, Winnie,  the Rev. Jesse Jackson and entertainers Jones and Lionel Richie. People in the  crowd -- among them, Jane Fonda, Kris Kristofferson, Muhammad Ali and dozens of  other celebrities -- sat back and tapped their feet to the strains of American  gospel hymns and the music of South Africa's ghettos for more than an hour  before Mandela spoke.    Despite the presence of hundreds of the famous, the South African leader paused  briefly to chat with one man without much of a portfolio. He was D. J. Riley, a  handicapped UCLA law student in a wheelchair. After Mandela continued on his  way, a beaming Riley said that ""I told him I loved him. He said it was very  nice to meet me and he said he loved me, too.""    Last week, it took New York 24 hours and two celebrity fests to drum up $1  million for Mandela; Los Angeles bested that with advance ticket sales for one  event, adding up five-figure tax-deductible checks signed by everyone from Arco  to Zomba Entertainment.    Organizers declined to reveal the cost of preparations, but sponsors were  pushing for low overhead decor in the high-ceilinged room. ""We'd like all the  money to go to the ANC,"" one said.    In fact, it goes to the Mandela Freedom Fund for education, business and  communications projects. Another group, Democracy for South Africa, is  political and contributions to that are not tax deductible.    The Friday night affair was a low-key dinner -- flattened chicken and Caesar  salad -- with high octane diners. Fitting more than 900 VIPS into the cavernous  armory required sometimes cramming a dozen people around tables meant for 10,  people who are not accustomed to being crammed.    ""This is the A-ticket crowd, this is the I-want-to-touch-the-hem-of-his-gown  crowd,"" bragged advance man Willis Edwards, who has insisted that there be only  one celebrity on this tour -- Mandela himself.

AFRICA: ANC LEADER SAYS THE GOVERNMENT IS UNWILLING TO ACT TO END BLACK  FACTIONAL VIOLENCE. HE WARNS OF POSSIBLE RETURN TO ARMED STRUGGLE.      By SCOTT KRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER      JOHANNESBURG, South Africa      As black factional fighting flared again near Johannesburg, Nelson Mandela met  President Frederik W. de Klerk on Tuesday and later declared the peace process  imperiled by government reluctance to move swiftly to end the township carnage.    ""It is dragging its feet, (and) the peace process is definitely threatened,""  Mandela told reporters after leading a 22-person African National Congress  delegation in three-hour talks with De Klerk in Pretoria.    Mandela added that the ANC might be forced by its supporters to consider a  return to the 29-year-old armed liberation struggle, which it formally  suspended last month.    ""If the government fails to take action, if violence continues to rise and the  people continue to demand to be armed, we will find it difficult to oppose that  demand, and, of course, the consequences would be very clear to everybody,""  Mandela said.    The fighting between factions, which pits mostly migrant Zulu workers from  Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom Party against Xhosas and other  supporters of Mandela's ANC, has thus far claimed nearly 700 lives in townships  surrounding Johannesburg since late July.    It appears to echo the three-year-old internecine war in the eastern province  of Natal, Buthelezi's home base. Battles between Zulu followers of Inkatha and  Zulu followers of the ANC have claimed nearly 4,000 lives in Natal.    Although both Mandela and De Klerk renewed their commitment to the process of a  peaceful, negotiated end to black oppression on Tuesday, they remained at odds  over the cause of the violence near Johannesburg and in Natal.    Top-level government officials delivered a rare public criticism of Mandela  this week, and chief government negotiator Gerrit Viljoen said that the ANC  ""must cease claiming total innocence for themselves and their followers, and  laying blame on their opponents, or the police.""    The ANC, the largest and most influential black political group in the country,  has accused the police of siding with Inkatha, a charge that the police deny.  Numerous accounts of witnesses to the violence in Johannesburg-area townships  suggest that some policemen may be assisting Inkatha against the ANC, the  government's old enemy.    On Tuesday, at least 24 people were hacked, shot or burned to death in battles  between migrant Zulus and township residents in Katlehong, Vosloorus and Tokoza  townships southeast of Johannesburg. Police officers and troops under white  commanders exchanged gunfire with black combatants in the townships, police  said.    Mandela has claimed that elements of the police who oppose De Klerk's peace  initiatives are stoking the black fighting to subvert the peace process.    ""I wish to state very clearly and very emphatically the government has the  capacity to put an end to this violence if it wants to, and I want them to use  that capacity,"" Mandela said Tuesday.    ""The amount of casualties suffered by our people and the failure of action by  the government threatens the peace process,"" he added.    The ANC delegation told De Klerk that it had launched a concerted effort to end  the violence in Natal, including several short-lived peace agreements with  Inkatha leaders in some areas. But it said that none of its strategies would  work unless the government security forces began acting impartially.    The ANC leaders said that the government could end the fighting in Natal only  if its security forces took over from the self-government Kwazulu homeland's  police force, which is under the command of Buthelezi. The ANC also recommended  that police commanders in Natal establish open lines of communication with ANC  leaders.    De Klerk, saying he was deeply concerned about the escalating violence,  promised to consider the ANC's recommendations. The president added that the  government already had taken steps to increase police patrols in Natal and  improve socioeconomic conditions there.    De Klerk also said ""the growing sense of urgency in the country . . . demands a  commitment by all representative leaders to peacefully work out the  constitutional future of the country."" The remarks were an apparent reference  to Mandela's refusal to meet Buthelezi.    Mandela said that the ANC would give De Klerk time to respond to its  suggestions.    ""Despite (the government's) past record of making statements they have not  carried out, let us give them a chance,"" he said. But ""the government cannot be  allowed to talk peace and negotiation and at the same time conduct war against  us.""

Let us heal  the wounds of the past.""    The African National Congress president, whose triumph in  the  majority-rule elections is expected to be confirmed this  weekend, placed emphasis on rule by multi-party consensus.    Interviewed in the Johannesburg hotel he is using as a  temporary headquarters, Mr Mandela looked relaxed and confident  as he outlined his approach to the presidency which will crown  his life-long battle against the last outpost of  institutionalised racism.    The ANC leader said both police and military commanders had  swung behind him, and he was confident of achieving the goal of  national reconciliation.    Mr Mandela said it would be an executive presidency,  dismissing speculation that he would go into semi-retirement as  a ceremonial head of state. But he said it was crucial that the  entrenched power-sharing government should not be an empty shell.    ""If we bring in a political party which has succeeded in  winning 5 per cent and more of the total votes cast in an  election, they must feel they are part of a government; they  must feel they are part and parcel of wielding power,"" he said.    ""Even if we emerge with a landslide victory, we have to be  very careful not to create the fear that the majority is going  to be used for the purpose of coercing the minorities.""    The intention, Mr Mandela said, was to maintain in  government  the tradition of consensus that had proved so successful in  constitutional negotiations. Policy had to be ""the collective  responsibility of every political party that is involved in the  government of national unity"".    He denied this would lead to governmental parallsis,  pointing  out that the negotiations had involved 26 political parties  ""pulling in different directions"", but had made ""extraordinary  achievements"".    ""I keep on warning against one organisation -- no matter how  strong -- taking unilateral decisions in regard to matters that  require the consultation of all political parties. We have made  progress since 1990 precisely because we have not forgotten the  principle that consensus in addressing major national issues is  critical.""    Whites, with their training and skills, were vital to the  future of the country, Mr Mandela said. ""That is why we are  saying to them: `South Africa is your country.'"" All South  Africans, bound together by ""a common loyalty and a common love  for their common fatherland"", had to be part of society's  transformation.    The process of consultation should apply even to such issues  as re-naming streets and landmarks, he said. Changes to symbols  should be subject to ""very intense and patient and serious  discussions with all the parties that are involved"", so as to  avoid frightening or antagonising minority communities.    Mr Mandela hinted that the world's longest-serving foreign  minister, Pik Botha, might keep his job, indicating which  members of the National Party would be welcomed into his cabinet.    He named Roelf Meyer, the minister of constitutional  development, Kobie Coetsee, the minister of justice and defence,  and Leon Wessels, the minister of manpower, as ""genuine South  Africans who want problems solved realistically"". He described  Mr Botha as one of the most enlightened members of the National  Party.    Showing a striking change of attitude towards the security  forces, Mr Mandela said their ""lack of credibility and  legitimacy is now being wiped out"". He said they should be seen  as representing ""the nation and the community"".    Mr Mandela disclosed that he had addressed the general staff  of both the police force and the South African Defence Force and  had held strategy discussions with the police commissioner,  General Johan van der Merwe, at his home.    Once branded a terrorist, Mr Mandela said the police and the  defence force, as well as the national intelligence service and  the civil service, would ""play an important, if not decisive  role""in this transformation, and anyone who wants to demonise  them is rendering a disservice to South Africa"".    On the question of indemnity, he confirmed that people who  had committed crimes in the defence of apartheid before October  1990 would be guaranteed a pardon on the same basis that it had  been granted to antiapartheid activists.    Indemnity for offences committed between October 1990 and  December 1993 would be subject to the discretion of the new  parliament. He said his own view on such offenders was that ""we  must consider granting them indemnity"". He added: ""But you must  appreciate, of course, that People have lost their families and  are feeling very bitter, and we will have to consider the  question case by case in so far as that category is concerned.""    ""But my approach is let bygones be bygones...And we will  adopt a solution in regard to each case that is influenced by  that principle.""    He said the ANC still wanted to set up a truth commission to  investigate civil rights abuses during the anti-apartheid  struggle. ""The truth commission (and I say we may change the  name if it creates concern on the part of the security forces)  is intended to collect evidence to deal with those people who  want to be indemnified -- not for the purpose of having a  Nuremberg trial, but for the purpose of granting an indemnity on  an individual basis.""    Asked whether this meant the commission would hear evidence  but keep it secret, Mr Mandela said: ""That is what happened when  we [ANC members] were granted an indemnity. There was no  disclosure that so-and-so committed this offence. The same  thing must happen to those who committed offences in defence of  apartheid.""    ""I don't think we should expose people,"" he added.  Confessions would be required only to identify the offence for  which the indemnity application was being made. ""That is the  end of the matter; he will be granted an indemnity. No [public]  indication is going to be made what crime he committed.""    Asked how he intended dealing with rightwing extremists, the  ANC leader said: ""We must never forget that the National Party  of Mr De Klerk was once in exactly the same position as the  right wing today.""    The most important weapon against the right wing, he said,  was the ""dialogue, persuasion, criticism, not coercion"", that  had proved successful against the Nationalists.    Mr Mandela disclosed that he had held talks with the  secretive Broederbond, conservative leaders of the main  agricultural organisations, and the guru of the right, Carel  Boshoff. He met the leader of the Freedom Front, General  Constand Viljoen, four times, the Conservative Party leader,  Ferdie Hartzenberg, three times, and the whole leadership of the  Dutch Reformed Church twice.    He had done this, he said, ""because I wanted this process to  be inclusive. And I have done well.""     "

Answering questions after his opening address to the  two-day World Economic Forum [WEF] conference in Cape Town, he  said a clause of the African National Congress' Freedom Charter  of 1955 had called for the nationalisation of a ""limited sector""  of the economy -- the mines, banks and monopolies.    That had been the correct strategy because history had shown  countries had not been able to escape nationalisation after a  trauma such as war.    However, he and the ANC had been ""so hammered"" on the  nationalisation issue at the 1992 WEF conference in Davos,  Switzerland, that it ""became clear that although we were correct  in this strategy, we had to do something if we wanted investment  in the country"", Mr Mandela said -- to applause and laughter  from the international and local delegates.    The ANC had, therefore, shifted its stance and its position  today was exactly the same as that of Germany, where the  constitution provided for nationalisation but where it had not  been implemented for decades.    ""Now our position is a pragmatic one,"" President Mandela  added.     "

And it emerged that Mandela is being seen by fellow African  heads of state as a key to mediating in the Rwandan and Angolan  wars. Mandela's spokesman, Joel Netshitenzhe, said yesterday  both Rwandan government and rebel representatives had asked to  meet Mandela to seek his help in resolving the bloody conflict.  He said Mandela would meet the two parties.    Addressing a press conference at the SA embassy in Tunis  yesterday, Mandela also revealed he had discussed the Angolan  war with President Eduardo dos Santos of Angola and President  Mobutu of Zaire during the Organisation of African Unity summit  in Tunis.    He reiterated his willingness to meet UNITA [Total  Independence for the Liberation of Angola] leader Jonas Savimbi  to help resolve the Angolan dispute.    On possible reparations by South Africa to African  countries,  he said no compensation would be offered to countries that had  helped in the liberation struggle because they had done it not  for reward but from a sense of duty.    Mandela was asked how the Government would respond to  requests for reparations in the light of indications that the  Angolan government might seek such payments.    ""We are prepared to discuss issues with the aim of resolving  past differences, and if we have the resources and there is a  demand that we should make reparations we will have to consider  that matter seriously"".    He said that if a complaint was made by a neighbouring  country about damage done by the previous government ""we cannot  take the attitude that, look this was a minority government, we  are not responsible for its crimes.    ""But the matter will have to be discussed very carefully.    ""We too were involved in the struggle as organisations and  as  people not affiliated to any particular organisation.    ""Now that we are free we are not going to give any material  resources to the people who took part in the struggle other than  to help to raise their living standards to ensure that they have  a secure future.    ""It was in that spirit that the continent of Africa helped  us.""    Asked whether Deputy President F.W. de Klerk's failure to  attend certain recent functions indicated a split between him  and the president, Mandela said both he and De Klerk at times  had to miss functions because of the pressure of other duties.

AFRICA GIVEN ANC ULTIMATUM;    APARTHEID: GUERRILLA WAR COULD BE RESUMED IF ALL OBSTACLES TO NEGOTIATIONS ARE  NOT REMOVED, THE DELEGATES WARN. MANDELA'S DEALINGS WITH THE REGIME ARE  CRITICIZED.      By SCOTT KRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER      SOWETO, South Africa      The African National Congress' first consultative conference in 31 years  concluded Sunday with a militant ultimatum to the government: remove all  obstacles to negotiations by the end of April or the ANC will consider  suspending talks and resuming its guerrilla war.    The hard-line ANC attitude was further reflected in the revelation that Deputy  President Nelson Mandela and other ANC leaders had been sharply criticized  during closed sessions of the three-day meeting for their conduct during talks  with the government thus far.    Mandela himself mentioned the criticism in his closing address to the 1,600  delegates, many of whom are clearly uneasy talking to a government that, in  their view, wants to maintain white domination of the black majority.    Mandela told delegates he welcomed the frank evaluation of the ANC leaders'  failings, but he also strongly defended his confidential discussions with the  government, his reference to President Frederik W. de Klerk as ""a man of  integrity"" and his contacts with leaders of the nominally independent black  homelands.    However, Mandela added, the ANC's ability to raise its complaints with the  leadership had been a healthy step for the once-revolutionary movement, which  has been legal in South Africa for only 10 months.    ""We have emerged from this congress stronger than we were before,"" Mandela said  to loud applause.    For several months, militant ANC members have expressed private concern that  the 72-year-old Mandela, the leader of talks with the government, has been  unaware of the growing distrust of the Pretoria government among rank-and-file  members.    Several resolutions passed by the conference over the weekend contained  specific demands that the ANC's 37-member national executive committee consult  more closely with members nationwide. And the conference resolutions indicated  a militancy that surprised many political analysts.    On Saturday, the ANC flatly rejected a proposal, advanced by the influential  foreign affairs chief, Thabo Mbeki, that it draw up a plan for a phased removal  of sanctions against Pretoria, even as worldwide sanctions are beginning to  crumble. Mbeki said Sunday that the proposal is still being studied, however.    Although the ANC decided to proceed with ""talks about talks"" with the  government, it expressed dissatisfaction with the government's pace of reform  and said the government must clear away several obstacles before formal  constitutional negotiations can begin. The government has said it hopes to  launch those negotiations early next year.    Among the obstacles cited by the ANC were the release of all political  prisoners, the return of exiles, the repeal of repressive legislation and the  end of political trials. The government agreed in August to begin granting  amnesty for prisoners and exiles, but the process has been slowed by delays and  administrative difficulties on both sides.    ""It was the clear view of the conference that in order to get the negotiation  process going, much, much more has to be done (by the government),"" said Joe  Slovo, a leading figure on the ANC executive. ""Until those steps are taken, we  don't see a prospect of beginning proper negotiations.""    The ANC also decided to launch a campaign of protests, marches and other forms  of mass action to pressure De Klerk to remove those obstacles and end black  factional fighting, which has claimed more than 3,000 lives in South African  townships this year. The ANC claims the township violence is being orchestrated  by government agencies, including the security forces, in an attempt to  undermine support for the ANC.    ""Our patience with this regime is running out,"" the conference said in its  closing declaration. ""The regime has its own agenda, that of retaining white  domination in a new form. It is violating and distorting all its undertakings  to the ANC and the people.""    The conference added that the ANC's military wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe (Spear of  the Nation), ""must play a facilitative role in the defense of our people.""    ""Our people are being butchered in their homes,"" said Joe Modise, the Umkhonto  we Sizwe commander. ""And it is the legitimate right of the people to defend  themselves.""    The ANC agreed in August to suspend its armed struggle against Pretoria, but  the two sides have yet to agree on terms of dismantling of the ANC's  underground guerrilla forces.    In a rare public assessment of the ANC's internal difficulties, Mandela  admitted that the organization has been slow to establish links of  communication between the leaders and its 300,000 members across the country.  However, he added that ""we are really now at the stage that we feel confident  we are in physical contact with our people.""    Mandela also responded in detail to delegates' criticisms of his handling of  talks with the government. He said suggestions that the ANC halt all  confidential discussions with the government ""are totally unreasonable.""    ""There would have been no . . . future prospect of negotiations if there were  no confidential meetings between the ANC and the government,"" he said. He added  that having confidential talks ""does not mean we are compromising our  position.""    Mandela rejected a suggestion that ANC leaders take no actions without  consulting the members, saying such a proposal could ""only be made by people  who have no idea of the problems that face the leadership on the ground."" And  he cited half a dozen instances in which his personal calls to President De  Klerk or Cabinet members had resolved urgent problems facing ANC members.    Mandela also responded to criticism that he was wrong to refer to De Klerk, as  he often has, as ""a man of integrity.""    ""The strategies of our organization are not determined by the integrity or  honesty of any particular individual,"" Mandela said. ""Our strategy is guided by  the fact that De Klerk represents apartheid.""    Some delegates had criticized ANC leaders for inviting chiefs of the black  homelands to join negotiations. Mandela defended that decision, saying that one  of the ways of isolating the government was ""to get at people upon whom they  (the government) have relied for support of apartheid.""    And Mandela noted that many African countries have been racked by civil wars  because the black governments refused to enter discussions with their enemies.    ""I hope our (ANC) comrades would take account of such experiences and ensure  such tragedies don't befall us,"" Mandela said.

""Our patience with this regime is running out,"" the conference said in its  closing declaration. ""The regime has its own agenda, that of retaining white  domination in a new form. It is violating and distorting all its undertakings  to the ANC and the people.""    The conference added that the ANC's military wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe (Spear of  the Nation), ""must play a facilitative role in the defense of our people.""    ""Our people are being butchered in their homes,"" said Joe Modise, the Umkhonto  we Sizwe commander. ""And it is the legitimate right of the people to defend  themselves.""    The ANC agreed in August to suspend its armed struggle against Pretoria, but  the two sides have yet to agree on terms of dismantling of the ANC's  underground guerrilla forces.    In a rare public assessment of the ANC's internal difficulties, Mandela  admitted that the organization has been slow to establish links of  communication between the leaders and its 300,000 members across the country.  However, he added that ""we are really now at the stage that we feel confident  we are in physical contact with our people.""    Mandela also responded in detail to delegates' criticisms of his handling of  talks with the government. He said suggestions that the ANC halt all  confidential discussions with the government ""are totally unreasonable.""    ""There would have been no . . . future prospect of negotiations if there were  no confidential meetings between the ANC and the government,"" he said. He added  that having confidential talks ""does not mean we are compromising our  position.""    Mandela rejected a suggestion that ANC leaders take no actions without  consulting the members, saying such a proposal could ""only be made by people  who have no idea of the problems that face the leadership on the ground."" And  he cited half a dozen instances in which his personal calls to President De  Klerk or Cabinet members had resolved urgent problems facing ANC members.    Mandela also responded to criticism that he was wrong to refer to De Klerk, as  he often has, as ""a man of integrity.""    ""The strategies of our organization are not determined by the integrity or  honesty of any particular individual,"" Mandela said. ""Our strategy is guided by  the fact that De Klerk represents apartheid.""    Some delegates had criticized ANC leaders for inviting chiefs of the black  homelands to join negotiations. Mandela defended that decision, saying that one  of the ways of isolating the government was ""to get at people upon whom they  (the government) have relied for support of apartheid.""    And Mandela noted that many African countries have been racked by civil wars  because the black governments refused to enter discussions with their enemies.    ""I hope our (ANC) comrades would take account of such experiences and ensure  such tragedies don't befall us,"" Mandela said.

Speaking at Potchefstroom's Ikageng Stadium, Mr Mandela said  some of ""our"" people wanted to kill every Zulu because they  thought incorrectly that all Zulus belonged to the Inkatha  Freedom Party. ""Even if they do support Inkatha, do not kill  them. Sit down and talk,"" he said.    Mr Mandela said all parties should be allowed to canvass  freely in townships, but this did not include Bophuthatswana's  President Lucas Mangope. ""I won't say to you you must allow  Mangope to canvass in the townships -- that I will not say,"" he  said.    Crime and violence had reached unacceptably high levels in  South Africa, which was now known as the most violent country in  the world, said Mr Mandela.    About 18,000 people had died in political violence since  1984, with as many as 12 people dying daily. There were 775  assaults every day and about 51 people were killed daily in  non-political violence. Fraud had increased by 80 percent in  the past few years and 1,058 people were raped daily, although  only 68 of these cases were reported to police.    Mr Mandela said the SA Police force was not sympathetic to  blacks and 64 percent of black adults felt hostile toward police.    Every South African had the right to live in safety, free  from crime and violence. The ANC planned to create social  justice and a democratic order which meant people would respect  the law of the country.    Mr Mandela stressed that community policing was the most  viable option to combat crime. ""The police must be visible and  in touch with the community."" Better training was needed, not  more police.    Much of the culture of violence had its roots in apartheid,  which had caused poverty and human degradation, said Mr Mandela.    There was no quick fix for the costly and complex process of  uplifting poor people. ""But if we develop human potential and  people are able to participate in the social and democratic  process, we will have responsible and productive people."" One of  the most important ways would be through education.    At present, 25 percent of annual expenditure was spent on  education. The ANC did not need more funds to implement its  ambitious youth and adult education programmes. ""Waste,  inefficiency and corruption must be stopped if we are to meet  out goals within budget. The ANC has budgeted R[rand]14 billion  for salaries, R1 billion for teacher training, R1 billion for  school supplies and R500 million on school buildings.""    Mr Mandela received a tumultuous welcome on his tour of the  Western Transvaal where thousands of people flocked to see their  hero during a hectic two-day schedule including seven mass  meetings in the scorching sun.    After speaking to a small group of farm workers at the  Boskop  Training Centre outside Potchefstroom on Monday morning, Mr  Mandela sped to the Ikageng Stadium to address the squatter and  poorer community.    He explained the ANC's Redevelopment and Construction  Programme and the ANC election manifesto which promised a  ""better future for all"".    His final stop on Monday is the Potchefstroom town centre's  banquet hall, where he will address businessmen and academics.    Security has been stepped up for fear of a rightwing  interference.

By CHARISSE JONES, TIMES STAFF WRITER      For many of the children of Los Angeles, these are times of guns in the  classroom, of gangs, drugs and disillusionment. A time of too few heroes. That  was why Harold Love was so excited Friday after seeing Nelson Mandela at City  Hall.    ""You sort of felt like you were in medieval times, seeing a king,"" said Love,  who at 15 was born too late to know Martin Luther King Jr., and other civil  rights giants as anything other than history book figures. ""In a way, he is: A  king for his people.""    While Mandela came to Los Angeles principally to meet with its movers and  shakers, moguls and movie stars, there were many in his audience who believed  his most important accomplishment was simply to stand before the city's  troubled youngsters as a real-life hero.    Specific visits with youngsters were not on Mandela's Los Angeles schedule, but  plans had been made to ensure they had opportunities to hear his message.  Community groups ferried gang members by bus to his speech at the L.A.  Coliseum. Schoolteachers took their young charges to City Hall. And students  organized a march on Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard to welcome Mandela.

Friday afternoon, hundreds of students from throughout Southern California  could be seen walking to the Coliseum from Rancho Cienega Park in Southwest Los  Angeles carrying banners and chanting slogans to the beat of an African drum  troop.    ""He has the strongest soul of any world leader,"" said Jacob Pinger, 19, a  member of the Los Angeles Student Coalition, which organized the nearly  four-mile youth march along with black, Asian and Latino student organizations  throughout Los Angeles. ""Kids are sick of seeing people elected and then  selling out as as soon as (the) people forget their promises.    ""Mandela,"" he said, ""is a leader that doesn't sell out.""    Motorists honked horns and saluted the marchers with upraised fists as they  moved slowly through the Crenshaw District.    Throughout South Los Angeles and other parts of the city, parents and teachers  had spent the last few weeks teaching their children about Mandela, to make  sure his message of hope and dignity was not lost.    At Marcus Garvey School, where black history is as much an educational staple  as reading and arithmetic, a little girl with auburn-colored corn rows had said  earlier in the week that she hoped Mandela would bring her a miracle.    ""I want Mandela to tell us people shouldn't be in gangs,"" said 11-year-old  Amber Mason, ""that they are killing up their own people. I hope Mandela would  change (it), that he'll make a difference.""    Mandela holds a special significance for many black children, who grew up on  stories of Selma and Montgomery, bus boycotts and freedom marches, but who were  born too late to experience them.    ""Most of them weren't around when King was living, so (they) don't understand  the significance of King and Malcolm X,"" said Louis Sheppard, a co-founder of a  manhood training program for young black men, who brought 42 students to see  Mandela speak at City Hall.    ""I believe by hearing Mandela they'll get a more international perspective and  realize that African-Americans are not an isolated people. They're getting to  see the problems affecting Africans all over the world.""    Sheppard, a history teacher at Palomar Junior High in Pomona, added: ""By being  here, they'll see the closest thing they're ever going to see to Martin Luther  King Jr. Twenty years from now, when their kids are talking about Mandela,  they'll be able to say, 'Oh yeah, I remember when.' And it'll make a  difference.""    But Mandela's message can transcend color. Young Mi Suh, a 19-year-old  Korean-American, said that Mandela is also her hero. Like King, she said, his  fight is for all victims of racism. ""And that includes me. That includes the  color yellow.""    She has read much about battles against oppression; of the civil rights  movement in America and of her own parents' struggles against the Japanese  occupation of their homeland. But history, she said, means little until you  feel it for yourself.    ""All the great things you hear (about) you have to make personal before it  means something to you,"" said Suh.    Not all youngsters were as convinced. Some said bluntly that they saw no  connection between South-Central and South Africa. They felt they would find  little inspiration in the words of an elderly man who lived half a world away.    A few did not even know who Mandela was.    ""I thought he was a rapper,"" admitted Marcus, a former gang member, who first  heard Mandela's name on a rap-oriented radio station last week. ""They were  saying 'Nelson Mandela will visit' and I said, 'Who is this guy? He must be  somebody.'

Marcus said he believed a long time  ago, when he thought supermen could leap buildings in a single bound. But they  couldn't help him get a job, or give him an alternative to gang life.

Leaders had a duty to point out to the people their basic  demands could not be met overnight. It could take up to five  years.    The government had raised R2.5 billion [rand] from its own  resources for reconstruction.    Past wastage of resources and distortion of priorities had  to  be borne in mind. For instance, R10 billion had been spent on  arms and ammunition while South Africa had been under no threat  from its neighbours, although only R2 billion had been spent on  housing in the same period.    Mr Mandela said the government proposed a more balanced and  effective tax collection system.    Once the country had addressed its internal problems,  especially violence, it would be on the way to creating a  climate for investment.    Mr Mandela said the development programme and the African  National Congress' manifesto also addressed the problems of  small business in South Africa.    He encouraged investors to form partnerships with black  businessmen and said the government was looking at the  difficulties black businessmen had in obtaining credit from  banks. It was considering the formation of a bank to finance  black business.     "

Addressing about 2,000 South African and Bophuthatswana  workers at a public forum in Pretoria, Mr Mandela said he was in  touch with State President F.

Answering questions atthe World Economic Forum's  southern African summit in Cape Town, he said in the past  opponents of apartheid who had applied for indemnity had had to  state what crimes they had committed.    ""Now we say we want to be even-handed."" Those who had  committed crimes in defence of apartheid would have to subscribe  to the same conditions. This was the only way in which the  wounds of the past could be healed.    Mr Mandela stressed the intention was not to institute  Nuremburg-style trials.    He added that the category of apartheid defenders being  referred to was those who had thought they were implementing  policies in which they believed, and not those who had planned  the murder of innocent people.    ""I hope all of you will accept our bona fides. We want to  say  we are committed to reconciliation.""    The ANC had said from its inception that South Africa  belonged to all its people, black and white -- and in the 1950's  152 leaders of the people had been charged with treason for this  principle.    ""We are the one organisation whose bona fides should not be  questioned,"" President Mandela said.     "

Mr de Klerk announced this at a news  conference at the Union Buildings after he met an ANC delegation  led by ANC President Nelson Mandela on Thursday [24 March].    Mr Mandela addressed a separate news conference at the Union  Buildings after they failed to fully agree on the measures to be  taken in kwaZulu. Mr de Klerk said while his government was  empowered to take over government functions in kwaZulu, as ANC  Secretary-General Cyril Ramaphosa had suggested earlier, this  was not what he intended doing.    Mr de Klerk briefed the ANC delegation which included Mac  Maharaj, Mr Ramaphosa and SA Communist Party Chairman Joe Slovo  on the government's security contingency plans for Natal. The  SADF [South African Defense Force] call-up would obviously  involve an increase in manpower levels, he said.    On a political level, Mr de Klerk said he would like to meet  Mr Buthelezi as soon as possible to discuss arrangements to  ensure free electioneering in kwaZulu, and to discuss the  possibility of another initiative to involve the region in an  inclusive political process.    He would see Mr Buthelezi to prevent the necessity for SA  Government intervention.    Mr Mandela told a separate news conference Mr de Klerk had  not reacted like a state president in his comments on Mr  Ramaphosa's suggestions, but like a petty politician. Mr  Mandela was ""completely disgusted"" by Mr de Klerk's response.  Mr de Klerk had failed to contact Mr Mandela on the matter as  he should have handled an issue of national concern.    Asked whether there was a rift between him and Mr de Klerk,  ?r Mandela said they had ""made progress"" during their  discussions on kwaZulu/Natal's political and security situation.  If there was progress, free and fair elections in Natal should  be possible.    Mr de Klerk had defended kwaZulu's and the IFP's actions,  and  ignored the fact that state resources were being used to  destabilise the political process, Mr Mandela said.    Mr de Klerk said he made it clear at the meeting that the  Transitional Executive Council [TEC] did not have the powers to  tamper with lawfully-elected institutions in kwaZulu. He  dismissed any notions that he was part of a strategy to topple  the kwaZulu government.    Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] Chairman Johan  Kriegler earlier briefed both leaders on meeting with the  kwaZulu Legislative Assembly on Wednesday. Mr de Klerk said the  IEC's information on the situation in kwaZulu was more negative  than initial interpretations had suggested.     "

Mr. Alioune Blondin Beye, special representative  of the UN secretary general in Angola, feels that talks are  dragging on. An agreement should have been reached long ago.    Before being sworn in as the president of South Africa, Dr.  Nelson Mandela expressed interest in assisting the Angolan  people in the best way possible.

President Nelson Mandela agreed to cooperate. He will not come  in with new diplomatic initiatives. He will only reinforce the  ongoing process. The ruling party is happy with Nelson Mandela's  readiness. His readiness was welcomed by the MPLA.    [Begin Lourenco recording] We welcomed his readiness to  assist. We think -- we have always said this -- every form of  assistance, every step that can truly contribute to the Angolan  people finding a lasting peace as soon as possible is welcome.

Mr Mandela played what  he hoped would be his ace. He offered King Goodwill powers as a  constitutional monarch with sway over the whole Natal province.  But Chief Buthelezi scuppered the proposal by insisting that  the offer could not be considered unless all Inkatha's other  concerns were handled at the same time.

Sources at the meeting said that the king then read out in  Zulu a hard-line, 12-page document which referred to perceived  past insults from the ANC and attacks on his supporters.

South Africa and the world have changed drastically since the days when Mandela  and his colleagues launched the armed struggle against apartheid.

Yet in all those years, Mandela's principled stands on the enduring problems  facing this wealthy, white minority-ruled country have remained steadfastly  unchanged.

Botha made world headlines when he offered to  release Mandela if the prisoner would renounce violence. Mandela's answer,  smuggled out by his daughter, Zindzi, and read to a rally that year, showed  that in more than two decades behind bars, he had not changed.    ""Only free men can negotiate,"" his statement bluntly responded. ""Prisoners  cannot enter into contracts.""    And a few months ago, at age 71, Mandela indicated that his years in prison  have not softened his stance on violence.

HE SAYS HE WANTS TO MEET 'HEROES' IN THE FIGHT AGAINST APARTHEID.      By SCOTT KRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER      LUSAKA, Zambia      Freed black nationalist Nelson R. Mandela, launching his first foreign journey  in a quarter century, arrived at African National Congress headquarters here  Tuesday to an emotional welcome from South African exiles, few of whom had ever  laid eyes on the man they consider their leader.    Lauding the thousands of ANC members who live and work in the southern African  country, Mandela said he was ""looking forward to meeting the heroes I have  looked to during my last 27 years in prison.""    The ANC, the primary guerrilla group fighting Pretoria, was banned in South  Africa two years before Mandela was jailed in 1962, and it has operated from  offices here for well over a decade. It now is making plans for a gradual  return home following President Frederik W. de Klerk's decision to legalize it.    Mandela's trip brought him into the fold of black-ruled nations in Africa who  have fought to maintain world pressure on Pretoria to end racial segregation  and give the black majority a vote in national affairs. Zambian President  Kenneth D. Kaunda and six other African heads of state greeted Mandela, his  wife, Winnie, and their delegation at the airport.    ""Viva, Mandela, Viva!"" cried hundreds of ANC supporters who gathered at the  airport and lined parts of the 15-mile road into town. The 71-year-old leader  waded into the crowd to greet groups of school children and women as they sang  songs praising him.    ""The people of Africa are waiting to hear from you,"" said Kaunda, who as a  leader of the so-called ""front-line states"" -- countries surrounding South  Africa -- has been one of the ANC's most outspoken supporters over the years.

HE SAYS HE WANTS TO MEET 'HEROES' IN THE FIGHT AGAINST APARTHEID.      By SCOTT KRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER      LUSAKA, Zambia      Freed black nationalist Nelson R. Mandela, launching his first foreign journey  in a quarter century, arrived at African National Congress headquarters here  Tuesday to an emotional welcome from South African exiles, few of whom had ever  laid eyes on the man they consider their leader.    Lauding the thousands of ANC members who live and work in the southern African  country, Mandela said he was ""looking forward to meeting the heroes I have  looked to during my last 27 years in prison.""    The ANC, the primary guerrilla group fighting Pretoria, was banned in South  Africa two years before Mandela was jailed in 1962, and it has operated from  offices here for well over a decade. It now is making plans for a gradual  return home following President Frederik W. de Klerk's decision to legalize it.    Mandela's trip brought him into the fold of black-ruled nations in Africa who  have fought to maintain world pressure on Pretoria to end racial segregation  and give the black majority a vote in national affairs. Zambian President  Kenneth D. Kaunda and six other African heads of state greeted Mandela, his  wife, Winnie, and their delegation at the airport.    ""Viva, Mandela, Viva!"" cried hundreds of ANC supporters who gathered at the  airport and lined parts of the 15-mile road into town. The 71-year-old leader  waded into the crowd to greet groups of school children and women as they sang  songs praising him.    ""The people of Africa are waiting to hear from you,"" said Kaunda, who as a  leader of the so-called ""front-line states"" -- countries surrounding South  Africa -- has been one of the ANC's most outspoken supporters over the years.    ""It's a special moment for all of us,"" added the president, meeting Mandela for  the first time. ""We love you. We respect you. We consider you a leader of the  ANC, a leader of the South African people (and also) our leader.""    Mandela thanked Kaunda for ""playing the role of peacemaker under difficult  conditions.""

0," LA062790-0015   239183    June 27, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition      Metro; Part B; Page 1; Column 2; Metro Desk      1372 words      RELATIVE FEW WILL GET TO SEE MANDELA;    U.S. TOUR: A MAXIMUM OF ABOUT 100,000 PEOPLE WILL SEE THE SOUTH AFRICAN LEADER  AT TWO PUBLIC EVENTS IN L.A. BUT FUND RAISING ON THIS STOP SHOULD BE A WINNER.      By ANDREA FORD and CHARISSE JONES, TIMES STAFF WRITERS      Nelson Mandela's planned visit to Los Angeles is considered one of the most  important stops on his U.S. tour, but the number of Angelenos who will get to  see the South African anti-apartheid leader may be no more than saw him at a  single street rally in New York City.    If 30,000 people show up as expected to hear Mandela speak outside City Hall at  noon Friday, and if the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum is sold out for an  evening rally, a maximum of about 100,000 people will see Mandela at the two  events, the only ones open to the general public.    By comparison, close to a million New Yorkers saw Mandela during his visit to  that city, 100,000 of them in Africa Square, a well-known intersection in  Harlem.    Los Angeles organizers concede that the numbers here will be small compared to  some of the other stops on Mandela's eight-city U.S. tour.    But they say that on another important measure -- fund raising -- the Los  Angeles stop should be a winner.    The Los Angeles committee organizing the Mandela visit hopes to raise at least  $1 million for the African National Congress, the organization of which Mandela  is the deputy president. Similar goals were set for New York and Washington.    Organizers point to several distinctions that separate Los Angeles from some of  the other big-city stops on the tour -- distinctions that help contribute to a  reduced crowd size.    They note, for example, that no venue larger than the Coliseum was available in  Los Angeles and that Mandela will be here for less than 24 hours, compared to  three days in New York and two in Washington.    They also noted that the largest crowd to date -- an estimated 750,000 people  -- saw Mandela during a ticker-tape parade. No parade is planned for Los  Angeles.    ""Sure we are a little disheartened. We wish 500,000 could see him in Los  Angeles,"" said Darlene Donloe, spokeswoman for the Los Angeles Nelson Mandela  Reception Committee. ""But we don't have a Popemobile and the Coliseum holds  only so many people.""    On Tuesday, comparative crowd size was of little concern to the local  organizers and city officials as they began putting final touches on  preparations for the Los Angeles stop -- the next to last for Mandela in the  United States.    Those preparations included getting ready for the huge numbers of out-of-town  and local journalists who will converge on the city to cover the event, making  arrangements and contingency plans for what could turn out to be a massive  traffic jam downtown during the City Hall speech and selling the remaining  20,000 tickets for the Coliseum rally and concert.    The rally will be preceded by a march down Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard by  thousands of college and high school students.    After an afternoon rest period, the 71-year-old ANC leader will attend a  fund-raising dinner and reception at the Armory in Exposition Park. He will  travel from there to the Coliseum rally. He leaves town the next morning,  heading for Oakland.    The all-volunteer reception committee, which was formed six weeks ago by  Assemblywoman Maxine Waters, will be Mandela's official host, but the city's  office of protocol and Mayor Tom Bradley's office are in charge of the first  half of Mandela's day in the city.    That includes his scheduled 10:30 a.m. arrival at Los Angeles International  Airport, his motorcade from the airport to City Hall, a brief welcoming  ceremony in City Council chambers and his first speech in the city on the 1st  Street steps of City Hall.    Mandela's plane will land in a remote part of LAX for security reasons, airport  manager Stephen Yee said. Only an official welcoming group and a limited number  of journalists will be allowed near the plane.    The cost of the police motorcade and the activities at City Hall will be  minimal, said Beatrice Canterbury Lavery of the office of protocol, and will  come out of the city's general fund.    The city is also providing police officers for traffic control and backup  security throughout Mandela's visit, but Los Angeles Police Department  spokesman Lt. Fred Nixon would not say exactly how many officers will be needed  and how much it will cost the city.    About 300 officers will be required for the Coliseum rally and the preceding  student march, according to other estimates.    Most of the LAPD's duties will involve handling traffic around City Hall and  providing backup security for the U.S. State Department, which is in charge of  Mandela's security while he is in this country.    Martin Ludlow, a union business agent who was tapped by the reception committee  to ""build"" a crowd for the City Hall speech, said he and his volunteers will  have passed out 300,000 flyers by the time Mandela arrives.    On the morning of Mandela's visit, Ludlow said, his volunteers will converge on  City Hall from several directions in sound trucks, urging downtown workers and  shoppers to go hear Mandela.    Nixon of the LAPD said handling a crowd of 30,000 around City Hall would  present no extraordinary problems for police. There are several contingency  plans to handle traffic congestion, he said.    ""If there are 30,000 extra cars downtown, then you have a problem, but if that  is not the case it shouldn't be too bad,"" he said. ""No worse than Dodger Day or  Laker Day.""    Vallee Bunting, a spokeswoman for Bradley, said 1st Street, Spring Street and  one lane of Main Street will be closed to traffic throughout the morning and  until after the City Hall speech ends.    Some traffic problems will also be created by the 3.7-mile student march from  Rancho Cienega Park, police said, but the scope will depend on the size of the  crowd. The march is being organized by the Los Angeles Student Coalition and  other groups. The park is in the 5000 block of Rodeo Road.    The march is scheduled to end at the Coliseum about the time doors open for the  rally. Because 20,000 seats will have to be removed for Mandela's security and  to build a stage, 70,000 of the arena's 90,000 seats will be available.    The crowd will be treated to a two- to three-hour concert featuring African,  Caribbean and African-American music.    As of Tuesday, the list of confirmed acts included South African trumpeter Hugh  Masekela, South African singer Letta Mbulu, and other gospel and rap  performers. The program is being directed by television, movie and stage  director Oz Scott and musician-composer Quincy Jones.    The committee has asked local grass-roots organizations and churches to charter  buses and buy blocks of tickets to be used by people who otherwise would not be  able to afford the $10 ticket price. As of Tuesday, 50,000 tickets had been  sold, Donloe said.    Brenda Shockley, coordinator of the reception committee, said she expected a  sellout for the rally.    The Southern California Rapid Transit District last Friday announced that it  will deploy 40 extra buses on five lines that run near the Coliseum to help  carry people to the rally.    Of the thousands who are expected to see Mandela during his Los Angeles visit,  few will have an opportunity for a close-up view.    Lavery will be the first city official to greet Mandela, joining him on the  plane as she would a head of state. Assemblywoman Waters and Mayor Bradley will  be at the head of the reception party greeting him on the Tarmac.    At City Hall, City Council President John Ferraro will be waiting on the curb  for the Mandelas to arrive. Inside City Hall, Mandela will meet briefly with  the mayor and then rest before going into council chambers, where an estimated  270 people are expected to gather.    Hollywood celebrities, Los Angeles politicians and religious leaders will be  among the chosen few to sit beside Mandela when he makes his speech outside  City Hall.    Gold-embossed invitations will admit 90 people to the VIP platform where  Mandela and his wife will accept keys to the city from Bradley, Lavery said.  Actor Gregory Peck will emcee a program featuring a gospel choir, Latino  dancers and a Japanese drum band.    There will be a limited number of seats for the public.    At the Coliseum, a block of seats will be set aside for about 100 reception  committee volunteers and about 1,000 big spenders who are expected to shell out  from $1,000 to $50,000 to attend the Exposition Park reception and dinner.

Organizers point to several distinctions that separate Los Angeles from some of  the other big-city stops on the tour -- distinctions that help contribute to a  reduced crowd size.    They note, for example, that no venue larger than the Coliseum was available in  Los Angeles and that Mandela will be here for less than 24 hours, compared to  three days in New York and two in Washington.    They also noted that the largest crowd to date -- an estimated 750,000 people  -- saw Mandela during a ticker-tape parade. No parade is planned for Los  Angeles.    ""Sure we are a little disheartened. We wish 500,000 could see him in Los  Angeles,"" said Darlene Donloe, spokeswoman for the Los Angeles Nelson Mandela  Reception Committee. ""But we don't have a Popemobile and the Coliseum holds  only so many people.""    On Tuesday, comparative crowd size was of little concern to the local  organizers and city officials as they began putting final touches on  preparations for the Los Angeles stop -- the next to last for Mandela in the  United States.    Those preparations included getting ready for the huge numbers of out-of-town  and local journalists who will converge on the city to cover the event, making  arrangements and contingency plans for what could turn out to be a massive  traffic jam downtown during the City Hall speech and selling the remaining  20,000 tickets for the Coliseum rally and concert.    The rally will be preceded by a march down Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard by  thousands of college and high school students.    After an afternoon rest period, the 71-year-old ANC leader will attend a  fund-raising dinner and reception at the Armory in Exposition Park. He will  travel from there to the Coliseum rally. He leaves town the next morning,  heading for Oakland.    The all-volunteer reception committee, which was formed six weeks ago by  Assemblywoman Maxine Waters, will be Mandela's official host, but the city's  office of protocol and Mayor Tom Bradley's office are in charge of the first  half of Mandela's day in the city.    That includes his scheduled 10:30 a.m. arrival at Los Angeles International  Airport, his motorcade from the airport to City Hall, a brief welcoming  ceremony in City Council chambers and his first speech in the city on the 1st  Street steps of City Hall.    Mandela's plane will land in a remote part of LAX for security reasons, airport  manager Stephen Yee said. Only an official welcoming group and a limited number  of journalists will be allowed near the plane.    The cost of the police motorcade and the activities at City Hall will be  minimal, said Beatrice Canterbury Lavery of the office of protocol, and will  come out of the city's general fund.    The city is also providing police officers for traffic control and backup  security throughout Mandela's visit, but Los Angeles Police Department  spokesman Lt. Fred Nixon would not say exactly how many officers will be needed  and how much it will cost the city.    About 300 officers will be required for the Coliseum rally and the preceding  student march, according to other estimates.    Most of the LAPD's duties will involve handling traffic around City Hall and  providing backup security for the U.S. State Department, which is in charge of  Mandela's security while he is in this country.    Martin Ludlow, a union business agent who was tapped by the reception committee  to ""build"" a crowd for the City Hall speech, said he and his volunteers will  have passed out 300,000 flyers by the time Mandela arrives.    On the morning of Mandela's visit, Ludlow said, his volunteers will converge on  City Hall from several directions in sound trucks, urging downtown workers and  shoppers to go hear Mandela.    Nixon of the LAPD said handling a crowd of 30,000 around City Hall would  present no extraordinary problems for police. There are several contingency  plans to handle traffic congestion, he said.    ""If there are 30,000 extra cars downtown, then you have a problem, but if that  is not the case it shouldn't be too bad,"" he said. ""No worse than Dodger Day or  Laker Day.""    Vallee Bunting, a spokeswoman for Bradley, said 1st Street, Spring Street and  one lane of Main Street will be closed to traffic throughout the morning and  until after the City Hall speech ends.    Some traffic problems will also be created by the 3.7-mile student march from  Rancho Cienega Park, police said, but the scope will depend on the size of the  crowd. The march is being organized by the Los Angeles Student Coalition and  other groups. The park is in the 5000 block of Rodeo Road.    The march is scheduled to end at the Coliseum about the time doors open for the  rally. Because 20,000 seats will have to be removed for Mandela's security and  to build a stage, 70,000 of the arena's 90,000 seats will be available.    The crowd will be treated to a two- to three-hour concert featuring African,  Caribbean and African-American music.    As of Tuesday, the list of confirmed acts included South African trumpeter Hugh  Masekela, South African singer Letta Mbulu, and other gospel and rap  performers. The program is being directed by television, movie and stage  director Oz Scott and musician-composer Quincy Jones.    The committee has asked local grass-roots organizations and churches to charter  buses and buy blocks of tickets to be used by people who otherwise would not be  able to afford the $10 ticket price. As of Tuesday, 50,000 tickets had been  sold, Donloe said.    Brenda Shockley, coordinator of the reception committee, said she expected a  sellout for the rally.    The Southern California Rapid Transit District last Friday announced that it  will deploy 40 extra buses on five lines that run near the Coliseum to help  carry people to the rally.    Of the thousands who are expected to see Mandela during his Los Angeles visit,  few will have an opportunity for a close-up view.    Lavery will be the first city official to greet Mandela, joining him on the  plane as she would a head of state. Assemblywoman Waters and Mayor Bradley will  be at the head of the reception party greeting him on the Tarmac.    At City Hall, City Council President John Ferraro will be waiting on the curb  for the Mandelas to arrive. Inside City Hall, Mandela will meet briefly with  the mayor and then rest before going into council chambers, where an estimated  270 people are expected to gather.    Hollywood celebrities, Los Angeles politicians and religious leaders will be  among the chosen few to sit beside Mandela when he makes his speech outside  City Hall.    Gold-embossed invitations will admit 90 people to the VIP platform where  Mandela and his wife will accept keys to the city from Bradley, Lavery said.  Actor Gregory Peck will emcee a program featuring a gospel choir, Latino  dancers and a Japanese drum band.    There will be a limited number of seats for the public.    At the Coliseum, a block of seats will be set aside for about 100 reception  committee volunteers and about 1,000 big spenders who are expected to shell out  from $1,000 to $50,000 to attend the Exposition Park reception and dinner.

The  government would spend the next few days working on the plan  following ""important inputs from the ANC's side"", said Mr de  Klerk.    The two sides will meet next week to discuss the composite  plan. The joint press conference was the first in South Africa  since the signing of the Pretoria Minute in August, 1990.    Tuesday's four-hour talks at Pretoria's Union Buildings were  attended by chief negotiators Roelf Meyer and Cyril Ramaphosa,  as well as Justice and Defence Minister Kobie Coetsee.    Mr Mandela noted the talks were conducted in a ""spirit of  reconciliation"". ""You will see that none of us has a blue [color  as received] eye,"" the ANC president quipped.    The leaders discussed more talks with the Freedom Alliance  to  try to persuade it to join negotiations.    Mr de Klerk said such an approach would be decided on ""in  the  next few days"". He reiterated the government and the ANC wanted  the Freedom Alliance to be part of the country's constitutional  settlement, adding that no effort would be spared ""even at this  stage"".    Mr Mandela said he had briefed the state president on his  Monday meeting with Conservative Party and Afrikaner Volksfront  [Afrikaner National Front] leader Dr Ferdi Hartzenberg,  whereafter Dr Hartzenberg said there was no point in continuing  talks with the anc on the Afrikaner demand for a ""volkstaat""  [Afrikaner homeland].    Mr de Klerk and Mr Mandela repeated their condemnation of  unacceptably high levels of violence, particularly on the East  Rand and in parts of Natal. ""(It) must come to an end,"" Mr de  Klerk said. He conceded the problem had been exacerbated by  Sunday's shooting during a tour of Katlehong by Mr Ramaphosa and  South African Communist Party leader Joe Slovo.    Mr Mandela said if violence was to be ended specific  proposals should not be publicised at present.    Mr de Klerk said he remained confident, however, that a free  and fair election was possible on April 27, but areas such as  the East Rand and Natal ""must be stabilised"".     "

Commenting on Sunday's massacre in Bhambayi,  in which 11 people were killed, he said the ANC's recommendation  that the police Internal Stability Division [ISD] be withdrawn  was being ""opposed at the highest level"". ""The government is  moving very slowly on this issue. That is because it is still a  white minority government which regards the lives of blacks as  cheap -- like that of flies, "" the ANC president said.    Mr Mandela, who is on a three-day electioneering visit to  the  Northern Transvaal, was speaking to reporters soon after  arriving by helicopter at Sekororo in rural Lebowa. He said  killings such as that at Bhambayi should be expected because of  the government's failure to maintain law and order. ""Until the  government decides to carry out our recommendations, the  violence will worsen. We are doing our best to address the  violence but we are not the government.""    Mr Mandela said the ISD was regarded by township communities  as ""carrying out war against the people."" He said violence had  subsided in East Rand townships after the deployment of the  Army, but the conflict had now shifted to areas such as  Bekkersdal and Bhambayi.    The ANC leader said his movement would ""be able to use the  capacity and resources of the state"" to end violence and  maintain law and order after the April elections.    Later, addressing a peoples' forum at the Sekororo  showgrounds, about 50km south of Tzaneen, Mr Mandela vowed there  would never be an Afrikaner ""volkstaat"" in South Africa as long  as he lived. Mr Mandela heard several complaints from residents  of the rural settlement about untarred roads, a shortage of  classrooms, a lack of running water and unemployment. He said  an ANC government would build houses, provide schools, tar roads  and act decisively to end the exploitation of farm workers.    He accused the National Party of spreading lies by claiming  an ANC government would seize pensions. ""Any government that  takes away pension benefits from old people is not fit to  govern. The ANC can never commit such cruelty.""    Mr Mandela is to address another peoples' forum in Sekhopo  before flying on to Venda on Monday night.     "

""We have guaranteed  investors against confiscation of their property and have  guaranteed their right to repatriate their profits and  dividends. Although the clause on mining is still in the  Freedom Charter, we have made the shift away from  nationalisation,"" he told delegates at the ANC Youth League  [ANCYL] conference in Soweto on Friday.    The ANCYL's annual conference is the last before the April  27  general election.    Mr Mandela said it was important to organise the economy to  enable it to deliver the goods in the face of high expectations  from the people. ""If the ANC government is unable to deliver  the goods, then you should overthrow it because it is not good,""  he said.    He said the ANC had also agreed to a code of conduct for  senior officials to avert the ""gravy train"" psychosis brought on  by apartheid. He said part of the code stated that any member  of the organisation receiving a donation of more than  R[rand]100,000 should immediately report it to the movement  because the organisation did not want its senior officials to be  unduly influenced.    He said salaries of government ministers after April 27  would  have to be commensurate with those of people in industry as  there was a tendency by state officials to live beyond the means  of ordinary people.    On violence, Mr Mandela said politically-inspired  disturbances had to be settled to ensure international  investment.    He said National Party [NP] leader Mr F W de Klerk was  convinced he would receive the support of most whites, coloureds  and Indians, and that violence would keep Africans away from  polling booths and so boost the NP's chances. This was in line  with NP strategy of using violence to prevent a decisive ANC  victory in the election, Mr Mandela claimed.    He said there was a time when the ANC was proud to proclaim  it was not involved in violence, but rogue elements within self  defence units [SDU] had changed this. ""We must admit that  discipline has broken down within some SDUs.""    Mr Mandela warned youths against complacency in the run-up  to  the elections. He said the challenge was to ensure the  organisation won 67 percent of votes as indicated in some  opinion polls.     "

Speaking to reporters before leaving for Barbados, the Cuban  leader considered it a political miracle that Mandela managed to  conciliate the different ethnic forces in his country in such a  way that the first interracial elections were successfully held  with the triumph of Mandela's party, the African National  Congress (ANC).

""They can derail any democratic  government in this country,"" he said, but added: ""It does not  mean that we are cowards. We will deal with that.""    South Africa was facing the Angolan and Mozambican scenario,  where civil wars that began at independence had raged for at  least 16 years, Mr Mandela told scores of SABC employees. ""We  are facing that situation,"" Mr Mandela said about the two  countries where warring sides are now seeking a negotiated  settlement.    While signalling further concessions to the rightwing groups  pressing for a separate state, the ANC leader said it was ironic  their demand was surfacing on the brink of black majority rule.  ""All the time they were happy to rule us. Now that the  challenge is from blacks, they want a separate state. We will  not concede,"" he said.    Without actually mentioned the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP],  Mr Mandela said blacks boycotting the elections were scared of  democracy and were hankering for white minority rule. ""What  they are saying is that: 'We don't want liberation, we don't  want to be free. We want to continue to be under the rule of  the white minority,'"" he said. The IFP Central Committee has  announced the party will not contest the election until its  demand for self- determination is granted. A national  conference later this month will take a final decision.    Afrikaner Volksfront [National Front] leader Gen Constand  Viljoen said on Wednesday ""limited violence"" could be used to  support the demand for an Afrikaner state and King Goodwill  Zwelithini said on Monday Zulus would resist threats to the Zulu  nation posed by the new constitution.    Reacting to questions on affirmative action in the SABC, Mr  Mandela said the ANC would redress the situation where currently  75 percent of staff at the corporation were whites. ""This is a  situation we can't tolerate. The problem of affirmative action  is one we must undertake. To fail to do so will be a betrayal  to all our predecessors who have sacrificed in order to ensure  that the day of liberation should come.""    But Mr Mandela also expressed concern about white skilled  staff leaving because of the changing situation in the country.  ""You must remain and fight with us,"" he said.     "

Addressing about 20,000 people at a rally to commemorate  International Women's Day at the Pietersburg Stadium on Sunday  [6 March], he said there would be no peace if some political  players remained outside the transitional process. ""I am still  prepared to talk to those who refuse to register. I have said I  am prepared to go down on my knees to ensure peace in the  country,"" he said.    Mr Mandela said he would urge the ANC, its allies and the  Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] to accept his proposal  that there should be no deadlines regarding registration for the  elections. ""Even after Friday night, absolute patience and the  ability to understand the fears of others.""    Earlier Mr Mandela said there were people who were prepared  to contribute to building a new South Africa, but whose efforts  had been rebuffed. ""These are temporary setbacks to such men of  integrity and vision and they should not be discouraged. The  future does not belong to a minority that wants to cling to  outdated policies, but belongs to those who have vision and  courage.""    Thousands of people from all over the Northern Transvaal  packed the stadium to hear the ANC leader's address. Mr Mandela  was applauded wildly when he arrived at the stadium on the back  of a bakkie [pickup] and briefly walked along the stands waving  and smiling at the crowd.    Later on Sunday he will travel to Magoebaskloof where he is  scheduled to meet Chief Samuel Nxumalo of Gazankulu's Ximoko  People's Progressive Party.     "
0,FT944-17906 ,"FT944-17906 _AN-EJFD1ABMFT 941006   FT  06 OCT 94 / Indian minister faces scandal inquiry      By STEFAN WAGSTYL and PAUL TAYLOR      NEW DELHI   India's criminal board of investigation (CBI) said yesterday it was continuing to investigate claims that a cabinet minister was involved in an Rs1.32bn (Pounds 26.7m) illegal financing scheme in a case arising from the 1992 Bombay securities market scandal. Mr B Shankaranand, the health and welfare minister, is accused of having authorised the diversion of funds from the state-owned oil industry development board (OIDB) to the syndicate bank, a banking institution, so that it could be, illegally, invested in the stock market. Mr Shankaranand was oil minister and OIDB chairman at the time of the alleged fund transfers in 1992. He denies any wrong-doing. The scandal centred on the illegal transfer of funds from banks into the stock market in order to try to make speculative profits, which were shared out among the banks, stockbrokers and bank clients, including private companies and state-owned enterprises. Details of OIDB's transactions were published in a report of a joint parliamentary committee into the scandal last year. It concluded Mr Shankaranand had violated prudential norms in his supervision of OIDB's financial investments. Mr Shankaranand's denials were included in a government report published in response to the parliamentary report. Paul Taylor adds: More than half the banks implicated in the Bombay securities scandal have paid their fines, according to the Reserve Bank of India. The Indian central bank, which earlier this week imposed new penalties on three more small banks, said 14 banks had so far paid the fines, which were imposed for alleged breaches of its rules on securities transactions. In July the central bank imposed fines totalling Rs1.47bn on 20 commercial banks, including foreign banks, which were severely criticised in a parliamentary report into the scandal published in December and were held liable for the bulk - Rs1.24bn - of the fines.

Mandela, facing pressure to end the growing black unrest in South  Africa's townships, returned home Saturday after a three-week foreign journey  and promised that his organization would devise a strategy to deal with the  problem and ""go into action"" soon.    But Mandela, 71-year-old deputy president of the African National Congress,  blamed the government for the escalating unrest, which has broken out  sporadically over a variety of issues and claimed 300 lives in the past month  in nominally independent ethnic homelands as well as in South African urban  townships.    ""Those who are worried about violence must talk to the government (and urge it)  to create conditions where peaceful forms of agitation are possible,"" Mandela,  flanked by his wife, Winnie, and colleague, Walter Sisulu, told a news  conference. He added that the trouble ""indicates the rejection by the masses of  the people"" of the government's policy of apartheid and its system of so-called  independent homelands for blacks.    Since Mandela left the country Feb. 27 for a trip to Zambia, Zimbabwe,  Tanzania, Ethiopia and Sweden, the autocratic leader of the Ciskei homeland has  been toppled by a popular military coup that prompted celebrations and two days  of rioting. A few days later, rioting in the homeland of Bophuthatswana erupted  during a march calling for the territory to be reintegrated into South Africa  in time for Bophuthatswanans to participate in the talks for a new South  African constitution.    Violence also has rocked black townships near Johannesburg. Warring black taxi  drivers in Katlehong have caused thousands to flee that township, and three  people died Thursday night when rumors swept the township of Sebokeng that  armed black attackers were poised to invade.    Mandela, who was appointed deputy president of the ANC during his stop in  Zambia, returned to South Africa from Sweden, where he spent a week thanking  the Stockholm government, the ANC's most generous overseas supporter, and  meeting with ailing ANC President Oliver R. Tambo. He was escorted from his  airport news conference here to a daylong concert by South African artists held  in his honor.    This week, Mandela is scheduled to attend independence celebrations in Namibia,  which formally ends 75 years of South African colonial rule Wednesday.    During the week, Secretary of State James A. Baker III is scheduled to meet  Mandela in Namibia and then call on South Africa President Frederik W. de Klerk  in Cape Town. Mandela acknowledged that the ANC had tried to discourage Baker  from visiting South Africa and that Mandela had refused to see him here.    ""If the secretary of state wants to see me, of course I'll see him,"" Mandela  said Saturday. ""But I will not see him in South Africa.""    ""A high-profile visit"" to South Africa ""can result in a lot of confusion,""  Mandela said. ""It would suggest that President De Klerk has done something  positive, something fundamental that requires the world to review sanctions.""  The ANC has welcomed De Klerk's initiatives but says they fall short of  creating a climate for negotiations.    Mandela also said Saturday that the ANC has chosen him to lead its delegation  for the first official meetings with De Klerk and his white minority-led  government in Cape Town on April 11.    He declined to discuss what might be on the agenda. But he reiterated the ANC's  position that its preconditions for negotiation -- amnesty for returning  exiles, release of political prisoners and ending the state of emergency --  ""are the minimum conditions"" for ANC participation in government-sponsored  talks on a new constitution that would give the black majority a vote in  national affairs.    The escalating unrest has complicated those talks by giving the government a  reason to retain its powers to quell violence under the state of emergency.  That violence, in which a white motorist was killed Thursday night near  Sebokeng township, also has hampered the ANC's attempts to reassure whites that  a black majority government would be orderly and fair.

This followed earlier  incidents at roadblocks in the small section of Bophuthatswana  around Thaba'nchu in the Orange Free State.    The roadblocks seemed to be set up to prevent Mr Mandela and  a large ANC and press contingent from laying a wreath on the  grave a former ANC president, Dr James Moroka, whose family  still farm in the Thaba'nchu District.    ANC NEC [National Executive Committee] member and the  organisation's Orange Free State presidential candidate, Patrick  ""Terror"" Lekota left his vehicle as Bophuthatswana defence force  soldiers ordered the 20 to 25 car caravan to stop. ""We were  told we would not be allowed through -- but went anyway,"" Mr  Lekota told SAPA after the wreath laying ceremony.    Mr Mandela told more than 30,000 cheering supporters at  Botshabelo, about 50km from Bloemfontein: ""As we entered  Thaba'nchu we came across a roadblock set out up by Mangope.  They were lucky they did not prevent us. I made it clear to my  men here, whether they liked it or not, we would go through.  Mangope on several occasions has said why does the president of  the ANC single me out from other homeland leaders. The question  is answered by him throwing up roadblocks preventing people  carrying on free political activity. This makes us loathe him  from the bottom of our hearts.""    Wearing a blue and grey blanket and Basotho hat Mr Mandela  added: ""We don't need permission from Mangope to move around our  country. You must understand that Mangope and his police force  are cowards. As we approached them his police were fiddling with  their guns. I was sure if I left the car and walked towards him  he would drop the gun and run away. In spite of all this, if  Mangope wants to settle we are prepared, for the good of our  country and the good of our people, to listen to what he has to  say to us.""    Mr Mandela is believed to have a meeting with Mr Mangope on  Monday morning before the Bophuthatswana leader goes into talks  with the government on the Freedom Alliance's [FA] participation  in the election.    Speaking about former FA members, Mr Mandela mentioned  Transkei and Ciskei leaders who had left the alliance. ""Now  (Ciskei leader Brig Oupa Gqozo), who was part of the Freedom  Alliance, has deserted them and come into the democratic  movement. We have accepted Brig Gqozo into the Transitional  Executive Council and some of his men are being trained as part  of the National Peacekeeping Force. These leaders from the  homelands have shown more vision than Mangope or Gqozo. And in  spite of all the unspeakable crimes he (Mangope) has committed  we are prepared to sit down and find a solution with him,"" Mr  Mandela said to deafening applause and drumbeats.    Mr Mandela then addressed the issues of the upcoming  election  and told his audience that many of them had been driven away  from the farms. ""Many of you are without jobs, houses and  security. Your problems are due to the fact that the National  Party [NP] government does not consider that your problems,  suffering and hardships are part of their responsibility. They  are interested in serving the needs of the white minority. The  majority of the farmers support the NP and that is why they do  not care for you. That is why you have low wages. That is why  they don't care.""    He then went on to tell the crowd their votes were secret  and  no one would know who they voted for.    On a lighter note he suggested when an employer offered a  worker money and transport to the polling station to vote for  the NP, ""you should take his R[rand]10, let him take you to the  voting station and then cast your vote for the ANC.    Speaking about NP claims the ANC did not have the resources  to implement its proposals, Mr Mandela pointed to large scale  government corruption and the selling off of state enterprises  that, he said, ""were only set up to benefit whites"". ""And then  they say we have no resources to carry out our reform  programmes."" ""Now that there is a possibility of a black  government taking over they have decided to get rid of those  state enterprises and privatise them. The effect of  privatisation is that wealth will remain in the hands of whites  in this country. The conspiracy between the government and the  mining houses by which the mining houses own the mineral  resources under the ground is another way of taking money away  from a new government. Up to two years ago the minerals were  the property of the state, and the mining houses only had  permission to remove them. Now as a black government is to take  over they have changed the rules.""    ""Dr Chris Stals, governor of the Reserve Bank stated that in  one year R10-billion had left this country. That money has left  the country because of the actions of the present government,""  Mr Mandela said.    ""The NP now argues after the corruption, privatisation and  its covert operations, we should not have a programme which will  ensure a better life for our people. What hypocrisy. We are  dealing with hypocrites, people with no vision, who are now  panicking.""    ""The number of people who have turned up during my election  campaign shows very clearly that the NP is detested by our  people like leprosy. And lepers they indeed are.""    He also called on the top levels of the civil service to  start thinking about programmes for a new government and to stop  behaving as custodians of apartheid. ""The public service  continues to behave as if apartheid was alive and well. The sad  truth is that the public service still behaves as if they are  servants of the National Party. It is time for the public  service to demonstrate its allegiance to South Africa. There is  no one in South Africa who does not know the ANC is going to be  the next government. President de Klerk still behaves as if the  public service is his, and the SADF [South African Defense  Force] is his private army.""     "

This emerged  after several hours of talks between ANC President Nelson  Mandela and his IFP counterpart, Mangosuthu Buthelezi, in Durban  on Tuesday [1 March].    ""We've laid a solid foundation for possible breakthroughs,""  said Mr Mandela at a press conference after the meeting. ""We  have laid the ground plan for future progress.""    On his party's stance on elections, Mr Buthelezi said:  ""Provisional (registration) means it leaves our options open.  If a solution is found, it makes it possible for us to  participate."" He said the IFP was determined to contest  elections, but he added that his party's demands, as contained  in the Freedom Alliance's proposals late last year, had to be  met. The Zulu king's demands also affected the IFP's  participation in elections: ""If we had a federal solution, the  issue of the king would not have come up. We can in no way  ignore it.""    The question of provisional registration had to be taken to  the IFP's Central Committee for ratification, he said.    Questioned on whether the IFP was closer to contesting  elections, he responded: ""Not at all.""    On his party's proposals to have the elections postponed, Mr  Buthelezi noted Mr Mandela and State President F W de Klerk had  made it clear this would not happen. But, he said, ""we have not  even started campaigning...It's only fair to give us a little  space to campaign"".    Asked about the Freedom Alliance, Mr Buthelezi said he  would have to consult his negotiation partners on IFP  participation in elections, but stressed the decision to  provisionally register for the poll was purely for the IFP. The  deadline for registration is Friday.    On international mediation, Mr Mandela said this was still  under consideration and had to be taken the party's principals.  [sentence as received]. Mr Mandela said later it was a  ""mistake"" to think the problems faced by the parties could have  been resolved overnight and he remained optimistic about future  meetings with the IFP president.    Both leaders said it was an ""absolute certainty"" they would  meet again soon to try to resolve their constitutional  differences. ""In discussions of this nature there can be no  deadline. Not even April 27 is a deadline,"" said Mr Mandela.  ""We'll continue searching for solutions even after April 27 if  we don't reach a solution now.""    The leaders resolved to redouble their efforts to encourage  their constituencies to participate in and support National  Peace Accord structures and all peace initiatives. Both parties  also agreed to establish a task group to strengthen peace  committees and to allow communication between themselves. But  the primary responsibility for law and order remained with the  government, Mr Mandela and Mr Buthelezi noted in a joint  statement.    The leaders said they would work together to try to ensure  canvassing for their respective views could take place.    Commenting on the relationship between the ANC and IFP  leaders, Mr Mandela said in spite of their political differences  they were ""very close friends...I came here in high spirits and  I'm leaving the meeting in higher spirits"".    ""It's sufficient for us to say we're satisfied with the  progress we've made,"" he added.     "

The commission, which was appointed by Mr Mandela, last week called on the ANC to punish those involved in the deaths of 22 detainees, and other cases of abuse and injury, and to pay compensation to victims or their families. Mr Mandela rejected these recommendations, calling instead for a 'Truth Commission' to investigate all cases of human rights abuse, including those involving government officials. Mt Cyril Ramaphosa, the ANC secretary general, drew a distinction between abuses carried out in defence of apartheid, and those committed in the fight for liberation. Asked whether the ANC believed that the ends justified the means in cases of human rights abuse, Mr Mandela replied: 'You can draw your own conclusions.' He said the ANC accepted 'collective responsibility' for what happened. He went on to excuse the abuses by saying that they were committed 'in an attempt to prevent violations of human rights by the other side'. Mr Mandela said any compensation to victims would have to be paid by a future government, not by the ANC. Meanwhile, he announced that Mr Thabo Mbeki, a leading moderate, had been elected national chairman of the ANC. This will boost Mr Mbeki's chances to succeed Mr Mandela as president. Mr Ramaphosa, another moderate, is the other possible successor, though he has come under increasing criticism for making too many concessions to whites.   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.

Money is very much a part of Mandela's 12-day, eight-city U.S. tour, which gets  under way Wednesday when he arrives in New York and ends in California on July  1.    The coast-to-coast trip will incur some mighty costs. But organizers hope  Mandela will inspire admirers -- from regular folks to Hollywood celebrities to  corporate giants -- to dish out some mighty donations for the cause.    Those who would market the Mandela name on souvenirs and trinkets have not been  forgotten. Hundred-dollar silk jackets and commemorative coins are on the list  of memorabilia under consideration.    Organizers say the money raised will pay for the trip, which carries a price  tag estimated at $300,000 to $400,000. The remainder will go to the African  National Congress, Mandela's organization that leads the fight against  apartheid, South Africa's system of racial separation.    The importance ""is not only that people be able to see and honor Mandela and  hear his message, but also have an opportunity to concretely donate to help the  struggle in South Africa,"" said Mae Ngai, deputy operations director for the  New York Anti-Apartheid Welcome Committee, which is overseeing preparations  there.    ""So even if that means just $5, we think most people will welcome that  opportunity to give to the ANC.""    In Los Angeles, New York and Detroit, $1-million fund-raising goals have been  set -- the money to be collected through elegant receptions and dinners,  rallies in sports stadiums and other events.    Whether such fund-raising goals are realistic remains to be seen. Some  donations are already in hand, but an accurate tally is difficult because the  fund-raising efforts are decentralized and sponsored by individual groups in  each city on Mandela's itinerary.    So far, the office of Detroit Mayor Coleman Young says $300,000 has been raised  there through donations from big business and others. In Los Angeles, movie  studios and production companies have pledged tens of thousands of dollars; in  New York, singer Billy Joel has booked Yankee Stadium and is lending it to  Mandela for a rally.    And one of the country's largest unions -- the American Federation of State,  County and Municipal Employees -- is asking affiliates to pass the hat.    But with preparations for Mandela's tour mired in what seems to be a constant  state of disarray, lofty fund-raising goals may be in jeopardy. Experts in  fund-raising caution that there has not been adequate time to gear up major  money collection projects.    Even if money comes pouring in, questions remain as to how much will be left  after the bills are paid. While some cities are donating services such as  police protection, organizers will still have to fork over big bucks for some  items, such as the Coliseum in Los Angeles -- a key venue for Mandela to reach  a large audience.    ""Events like this always cost more than you think,"" said a veteran fund-raiser  in Los Angeles. ""The big problem here is that they had to put it together in  such a short time. There hasn't been enough time to organize, find underwriters  and hit everybody up.""    The ANC, a financially strapped organization that is emerging from decades of  banishment, says it needs money to support and repatriate tens of thousands of  refugees, set up district and branch offices in 14 regions of South Africa,  launch literacy campaigns, and give job-training classes.    ""Our needs are enormous,"" Lindiwe Mabuza, the ANC's chief representative in the  United States, said in an impassioned plea for contributions during a news  conference last week in Washington. ""We have a grave need for financial and  material assistance,"" she said. ""And there is no other source of revenue.""    Mabuza said the ANC -- outlawed until shortly before Mandela's February release  after 27 years in prison -- needs everything it takes to convert from an  underground network to an openly active party: trucks, telephones, bicycles and  other ""instruments of democracy,"" such as fax machines, television and radio  stations and newspapers.    Money raised during the tour will be channeled into one of two funds: the  tax-exempt Mandela Freedom Fund, established for educational, business and  communications projects, and the nonprofit Democracy for South Africa, which is  dedicated to political work.    After New York, Mandela is scheduled to visit Boston and Washington (where he  will meet with President Bush), Atlanta, Miami and Detroit before he arrives in  Los Angeles on June 29. From Los Angeles, he travels to Oakland the next day  and then departs for Ireland.    Mandela and much of his entourage will travel from city to city on a private  jet furnished by a company that organizers refuse to identify. The U.S. State  Department is providing security, and many companies involved in preparations,  such as public relations firms, are cutting their rates for the tour in  sympathy to the cause.    Others are working free of charge, such as Roger Wilkins, the tour's national  coordinator. Wilkins is a senior fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies, a  Washington-based think tank.    In Los Angeles, where Mandela is scheduled to preside over a rally and concert  at the 90,000-seat Coliseum on June 29, sources involved in preparations expect  the sales of tickets -- at $10 apiece -- to cover all or most of the local  costs, assuming most tickets are sold.    ""When you are dealing with something like this, you have to make sure there are  no hidden costs (or) you can wind up sinking the same ship you came to sail,""  said Danny Bakewell, head of the Brotherhood Crusade. The Crusade, along with  several other organizations, donated $80,000 to the effort.    Only 12,000 tickets were sold as of Friday, according to Brenda Shockley,  project coordinator for the Los Angeles Mandela Reception Committee. But  Shockley noted that publicity for the event is just beginning. Groups are being  encouraged to buy blocks of tickets that can be given away to the poor.    If the Coliseum event does cover local costs, a $1,000-a-head reception at the  old armory building in Exposition Park, scheduled for the same night, would  generate pure profit, organizers said. Organizers hope to get 500 to 800 paying  guests.    The city of Los Angeles is absorbing the cost of police services, traffic  control and other logistics, a spokeswoman for Mayor Tom Bradley's office said.    Bills to be paid include use of the Coliseum, which will staff the event with  1,625 ushers, ticket-takers, concessionaires and security guards. Organizers  have budgeted an estimated $200,000 for that, though Coliseum sources put the  expected cost closer to $165,000. Another expense is 35 rooms for Mandela's  entourage at the Biltmore, at a discount rate of $106 a night. The hotel is  waiving the usual $1,800 charge for the presidential suite for Mandela and his  wife, Winnie, a Biltmore spokeswoman said.    Los Angeles is seen as a major source of funds because it is home to a number  of liberal politicians and wealthy entertainers.    Enthusiastic support is coming from ""every phase of the entertainment industry  because people understand what this man stands for,"" said Paula Weinstein, who  produced the movie ""Dry White Season"" and is helping to seek donations from  studios and production companies.    In Atlanta, a flap erupted over an offer by Coca-Cola to provide a plane for  Mandela and finance other parts of the trip. ANC leaders rejected the offer  because of Coca-Cola's holdings in South Africa.    The dispute underscored a strict condition that Mandela's followers have  imposed: No corporate donations are to be accepted from firms with investments  or franchises in South Africa.    ""A lot of companies who claim to have left South Africa, what they have done is  what we describe as a sham disinvestment,"" said Tandi Gcabashe of the American  Friends Service Committee in Atlanta.    Organizers say several corporations are coming on-board. Among them, Reebok is  helping to organize the tour, and Xerox Corp. has loaned office supplies.    Meanwhile, ""low-keyed"" marketing aimed at capitalizing on anticipated Mandela  mania is being planned to raise additional money.    Under consideration are items such as $100 silk jackets, all-cotton T-shirts  (no polyester blends allowed), posters, commemorative silver coins,  limited-edition bronze busts and coffee table books of photographs taken along  the tour.    ""It just dawned on a lot of people that, since this is America, there's going  to be T-shirts, posters, buttons -- whether authorized or not -- because that's  the American way,"" said Stephanie Vardavas, licensing director of ProServ, the  firm chosen to license and merchandise Mandela tour paraphernalia.    ""And it was best to harness that energy and turn it to the benefit of Mandela's  cause rather than let energy be dissipated without doing any long-term good.""    ProServ, based in Arlington, Va., manages the careers of 250 sports stars,  including basketball star Michael Jordan and tennis ace John McEnroe, and was  chosen because its founder and chairman, Donald L. Dell, formerly represented  black tennis player Arthur Ashe.    By the end of last week, few licensing contracts had been issued, and  manufacturers cautioned that time was running out.    An exception was Costacos Bros. Inc. of Seattle, commissioned to produce  Mandela posters. Bob Porter, director of production and licensing, said the  firm will print 50,000 posters initially, probably priced from $5.50 to $7.50  each.    In New York, Joel was booked into Yankee Stadium this week -- but instead  turned the facility over to Mandela's people for the night of their rally,  according to Kip Cohen of Bill Graham Presents, organizers of the event.    Carl McCaskill, a press spokesman for the Mandela committee in New York, said  the goal there is to net $1 million.    Private fund-raising events in the city will cost guests up to $2,500 each, and  will include a dinner hosted by actor Robert de Niro, director Spike Lee and  comedian/actor Eddie Murphy.    ""Creative fund-raising"" is being pursued by Little Steven Van Zandt, a rock  singer who heads Artists United Against Apartheid. He has asked club owners and  theaters around town either to donate their take for an evening or have their  artists perform as a special tribute to Mandela.    In Detroit, most tickets for a rally at the 49,000-seat Tiger Stadium on June  28 will be sold for $10 or $20 apiece, but a batch of 5,000 will sell for  prices ranging from $100 to $1,000.    In Boston, couples will pay $5,000 to attend a fund-raising reception at the  Copley Plaza.    In Miami, where Mandela will address the annual convention of the AFSCME,  members are being asked to contribute to show their ""continued support"" for the  ANC and the fight against racism, said Bob Harman, the union's public affairs  director.    Wilkinson reported from Los Angeles and Chen from Washington. Also contributing  were Times researchers Lisa Phillips in New York, Leslie Eringaard in Detroit,  Edith Stanley in Atlanta and Anna M.

The importance ""is not only that people be able to see and honor Mandela and  hear his message, but also have an opportunity to concretely donate to help the  struggle in South Africa,"" said Mae Ngai, deputy operations director for the  New York Anti-Apartheid Welcome Committee, which is overseeing preparations  there.    ""So even if that means just $5, we think most people will welcome that  opportunity to give to the ANC.""    In Los Angeles, New York and Detroit, $1-million fund-raising goals have been  set -- the money to be collected through elegant receptions and dinners,  rallies in sports stadiums and other events.    Whether such fund-raising goals are realistic remains to be seen. Some  donations are already in hand, but an accurate tally is difficult because the  fund-raising efforts are decentralized and sponsored by individual groups in  each city on Mandela's itinerary.    So far, the office of Detroit Mayor Coleman Young says $300,000 has been raised  there through donations from big business and others. In Los Angeles, movie  studios and production companies have pledged tens of thousands of dollars; in  New York, singer Billy Joel has booked Yankee Stadium and is lending it to  Mandela for a rally.    And one of the country's largest unions -- the American Federation of State,  County and Municipal Employees -- is asking affiliates to pass the hat.    But with preparations for Mandela's tour mired in what seems to be a constant  state of disarray, lofty fund-raising goals may be in jeopardy. Experts in  fund-raising caution that there has not been adequate time to gear up major  money collection projects.    Even if money comes pouring in, questions remain as to how much will be left  after the bills are paid. While some cities are donating services such as  police protection, organizers will still have to fork over big bucks for some  items, such as the Coliseum in Los Angeles -- a key venue for Mandela to reach  a large audience.    ""Events like this always cost more than you think,"" said a veteran fund-raiser  in Los Angeles. ""The big problem here is that they had to put it together in  such a short time. There hasn't been enough time to organize, find underwriters  and hit everybody up.""    The ANC, a financially strapped organization that is emerging from decades of  banishment, says it needs money to support and repatriate tens of thousands of  refugees, set up district and branch offices in 14 regions of South Africa,  launch literacy campaigns, and give job-training classes.    ""Our needs are enormous,"" Lindiwe Mabuza, the ANC's chief representative in the  United States, said in an impassioned plea for contributions during a news  conference last week in Washington. ""We have a grave need for financial and  material assistance,"" she said. ""And there is no other source of revenue.""    Mabuza said the ANC -- outlawed until shortly before Mandela's February release  after 27 years in prison -- needs everything it takes to convert from an  underground network to an openly active party: trucks, telephones, bicycles and  other ""instruments of democracy,"" such as fax machines, television and radio  stations and newspapers.    Money raised during the tour will be channeled into one of two funds: the  tax-exempt Mandela Freedom Fund, established for educational, business and  communications projects, and the nonprofit Democracy for South Africa, which is  dedicated to political work.    After New York, Mandela is scheduled to visit Boston and Washington (where he  will meet with President Bush), Atlanta, Miami and Detroit before he arrives in  Los Angeles on June 29. From Los Angeles, he travels to Oakland the next day  and then departs for Ireland.    Mandela and much of his entourage will travel from city to city on a private  jet furnished by a company that organizers refuse to identify. The U.S. State  Department is providing security, and many companies involved in preparations,  such as public relations firms, are cutting their rates for the tour in  sympathy to the cause.    Others are working free of charge, such as Roger Wilkins, the tour's national  coordinator. Wilkins is a senior fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies, a  Washington-based think tank.    In Los Angeles, where Mandela is scheduled to preside over a rally and concert  at the 90,000-seat Coliseum on June 29, sources involved in preparations expect  the sales of tickets -- at $10 apiece -- to cover all or most of the local  costs, assuming most tickets are sold.    ""When you are dealing with something like this, you have to make sure there are  no hidden costs (or) you can wind up sinking the same ship you came to sail,""  said Danny Bakewell, head of the Brotherhood Crusade. The Crusade, along with  several other organizations, donated $80,000 to the effort.    Only 12,000 tickets were sold as of Friday, according to Brenda Shockley,  project coordinator for the Los Angeles Mandela Reception Committee. But  Shockley noted that publicity for the event is just beginning. Groups are being  encouraged to buy blocks of tickets that can be given away to the poor.    If the Coliseum event does cover local costs, a $1,000-a-head reception at the  old armory building in Exposition Park, scheduled for the same night, would  generate pure profit, organizers said. Organizers hope to get 500 to 800 paying  guests.    The city of Los Angeles is absorbing the cost of police services, traffic  control and other logistics, a spokeswoman for Mayor Tom Bradley's office said.    Bills to be paid include use of the Coliseum, which will staff the event with  1,625 ushers, ticket-takers, concessionaires and security guards. Organizers  have budgeted an estimated $200,000 for that, though Coliseum sources put the  expected cost closer to $165,000. Another expense is 35 rooms for Mandela's  entourage at the Biltmore, at a discount rate of $106 a night. The hotel is  waiving the usual $1,800 charge for the presidential suite for Mandela and his  wife, Winnie, a Biltmore spokeswoman said.    Los Angeles is seen as a major source of funds because it is home to a number  of liberal politicians and wealthy entertainers.    Enthusiastic support is coming from ""every phase of the entertainment industry  because people understand what this man stands for,"" said Paula Weinstein, who  produced the movie ""Dry White Season"" and is helping to seek donations from  studios and production companies.    In Atlanta, a flap erupted over an offer by Coca-Cola to provide a plane for  Mandela and finance other parts of the trip. ANC leaders rejected the offer  because of Coca-Cola's holdings in South Africa.    The dispute underscored a strict condition that Mandela's followers have  imposed: No corporate donations are to be accepted from firms with investments  or franchises in South Africa.    ""A lot of companies who claim to have left South Africa, what they have done is  what we describe as a sham disinvestment,"" said Tandi Gcabashe of the American  Friends Service Committee in Atlanta.    Organizers say several corporations are coming on-board. Among them, Reebok is  helping to organize the tour, and Xerox Corp. has loaned office supplies.    Meanwhile, ""low-keyed"" marketing aimed at capitalizing on anticipated Mandela  mania is being planned to raise additional money.    Under consideration are items such as $100 silk jackets, all-cotton T-shirts  (no polyester blends allowed), posters, commemorative silver coins,  limited-edition bronze busts and coffee table books of photographs taken along  the tour.    ""It just dawned on a lot of people that, since this is America, there's going  to be T-shirts, posters, buttons -- whether authorized or not -- because that's  the American way,"" said Stephanie Vardavas, licensing director of ProServ, the  firm chosen to license and merchandise Mandela tour paraphernalia.    ""And it was best to harness that energy and turn it to the benefit of Mandela's  cause rather than let energy be dissipated without doing any long-term good.""    ProServ, based in Arlington, Va., manages the careers of 250 sports stars,  including basketball star Michael Jordan and tennis ace John McEnroe, and was  chosen because its founder and chairman, Donald L. Dell, formerly represented  black tennis player Arthur Ashe.    By the end of last week, few licensing contracts had been issued, and  manufacturers cautioned that time was running out.    An exception was Costacos Bros. Inc. of Seattle, commissioned to produce  Mandela posters. Bob Porter, director of production and licensing, said the  firm will print 50,000 posters initially, probably priced from $5.50 to $7.50  each.    In New York, Joel was booked into Yankee Stadium this week -- but instead  turned the facility over to Mandela's people for the night of their rally,  according to Kip Cohen of Bill Graham Presents, organizers of the event.    Carl McCaskill, a press spokesman for the Mandela committee in New York, said  the goal there is to net $1 million.    Private fund-raising events in the city will cost guests up to $2,500 each, and  will include a dinner hosted by actor Robert de Niro, director Spike Lee and  comedian/actor Eddie Murphy.    ""Creative fund-raising"" is being pursued by Little Steven Van Zandt, a rock  singer who heads Artists United Against Apartheid. He has asked club owners and  theaters around town either to donate their take for an evening or have their  artists perform as a special tribute to Mandela.    In Detroit, most tickets for a rally at the 49,000-seat Tiger Stadium on June  28 will be sold for $10 or $20 apiece, but a batch of 5,000 will sell for  prices ranging from $100 to $1,000.    In Boston, couples will pay $5,000 to attend a fund-raising reception at the  Copley Plaza.    In Miami, where Mandela will address the annual convention of the AFSCME,  members are being asked to contribute to show their ""continued support"" for the  ANC and the fight against racism, said Bob Harman, the union's public affairs  director.    Wilkinson reported from Los Angeles and Chen from Washington. Also contributing  were Times researchers Lisa Phillips in New York, Leslie Eringaard in Detroit,  Edith Stanley in Atlanta and Anna M. Virtue in Miami.      MANDELA, NELSON R; OFFICIAL VISITS; FUND RAISING; PEACE MOVEMENTS; AFRICAN  NATIONAL CONGRESS; APARTHEID; RACIAL RELATIONS -- SOUTH AFRICA; CONTRIBUTIONS;  CELEBRITIES    "
0,FT933-10055 ,"FT933-10055 _AN-DHFBQABIFT 930806   FT  06 AUG 93 / South African crisis talks end in stalemate      By PHILIP GAWITH   PRESIDENT F W de Klerk of South Africa and Mr Nelson Mandela, the ANC leader, failed to agree on ways to end the violence that has swept townships east of Johannesburg, in a four-hour crisis meeting yesterday. Government and African National Congress sources at the meeting said they reached no agreement on the causes of the violence or the best way to end it. Police Captain Wikus Weber said the death toll in six days of battles in townships had risen to 137. The meeting followed an announcement by Mr Mandela that arrangements were being made for a joint tour of the East Rand townships by the ANC leader and Mr Mangosuthu Buthelezi, leader of the mainly Zulu Inkatha Freedom party. It also came after the deployment of an extra 2,000 policemen, backed by the Defence Force, in an effort to restore peace. Before meeting Mr de Klerk, Mr Mandela had toured Katlehong, the township at the heart of the violence, where he struggled to convey a message of peace and reconciliation to angry supporters. Addressing a crowd of about 8,000, Mr Mandela said: 'We are building a nation. The answer has to be reconciliation, peace and political tolerance.' His call was met, however, with repeated cries for weapons and the presence of Umkhonto we Sizwe, the ANC's military wing. Mr Mandela also accused the police and security forces of not caring about black lives. 'To this government, to this police force, to the South African Defence Force, the lives of black people are cheap. It is as if flies had died.' Mr Mandela apportioned some blame to the ANC, admitting that ANC supporters had been involved in the violence. He said the violence was not only the responsibility of the government. 'Real leaders do not just point fingers.' This point is likely to be strongly argued by Mr de Klerk, who is also likely to stress that a considerable onus rests on Mr Mandela and on Chief Buthelezi to end the violence.

By SCOTT KRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER      SOWETO, South Africa      Nelson R. Mandela, submitting to dozens of interviews with television  journalists from around the world, said Wednesday the African National Congress  is willing to compromise and consider constitutional guarantees for South  Africa's white minority but will not budge on the issue of full black voting  rights.    ""Compromises must be made in respect to every issue, as long as that compromise  is in the interest not only of one population group, but the country as whole,""  the 71-year-old leader said as he sat in his back yard with an ANC flag behind  him.    Mandela also said he hopes a settlement to the country's long racial conflict  can be reached before President Frederik W. de Klerk's ruling National Party  faces elections in 1994.    ""I am convinced that, in discussions between the ANC and the government, we  will be able to find a solution which will be accepted by everybody, black and  white,"" Mandela said.    However, he added that the direction of the liberation struggle, including any  compromises, will be determined by the ANC leadership. It is meeting at its  headquarters in Lusaka, Zambia, to discuss Mandela's future role and to develop  a response to De Klerk's initiatives. Mandela said he will be traveling to  Lusaka soon.    The interviews were conducted at Mandela's home, a four-room brick house  surrounded by a tall fence in the Orlando West section of Soweto, where he  spent the night Tuesday for the first time since he went to prison in 1962.    Tens of thousands of blacks and whites have made the pilgrimage to Mandela's  house since he was released Sunday after serving 27 years of a life sentence  for sabotage. But things began to return to normal Wednesday, a day after he  addressed 120,000 people welcoming him home at a soccer stadium.    Foreign television crews lined up outside the Mandela home for 10-minute  interviews with the leader, who has become a unifying force among blacks during  his years in prison, and Mandela repeated again and again the themes that he  carried beyond the gates of Victor Verster Prison.    He defended the ANC guerrilla struggle, which he says should not be abandoned  until the government stops using force against blacks. He said government  installations are legitimate targets but added that ""you can't avoid people  getting caught up in the cross-fire when two people are shooting at each  other.""    ""People must not only worry about casualties"" caused by the ANC, he said. ""They  must worry about the series of casualties caused by the government over the  decades.""    However, Mandela stressed the ANC's commitment to peace and suggested that  whites who want an end to confrontation ""must support the government in its  effort to reach a peaceful settlement.""    De Klerk, who released Mandela on Sunday, told ABC-TV's ""Nightline"" on Tuesday  that he is not bothered by Mandela's continued support for the armed struggle.    ""It's a bit too early to judge"" Mandela's stand on the armed struggle, De Klerk  said, because the reasons Mandela launched the ANC's guerrilla war in 1960 are  no longer valid.    ""He said then that violence was justified"" because all the avenues to peaceful  political protest had been closed by the authorities, the president said. ""That  has changed.""    De Klerk has moved quickly in recent weeks to open up black political activity  by lifting 30-year bans on the ANC and the South African Communist Party and  rescinding restrictions on hundreds of anti-apartheid activists. The government  wants to create a climate in which it can lure black leaders, such as Mandela,  to the negotiating table to draw up a new constitution.    Government officials say they hope to have a new constitution with voting  rights for blacks within five years. A government elected under that  constitution, they say, is unlikely to be controlled by the ruling National  Party.    Although both the ANC and the government say they want to give blacks the vote,  they differ over what that future political system will look like. The ANC  insists on a one-person, one-vote system with a universal voters' roll. The  government wants a system that protects the white minority.    ""A simple majority-rule model is not the right system for South Africa,"" De  Klerk said on ""Nightline."" ""There must be equality, but checks and balances  have to be built in.""    Mandela has sought to reassure many of South Africa's 5 million whites who  worry about living under a government controlled by 27 million blacks.    ""We are aware of the fears of the whites of being dominated by blacks, and we  are addressing that very seriously and very earnestly,"" he said. And he added  that because of De Klerk's flexibility and integrity, ""the possibility of a  settlement is always there.""    Since his release, Mandela also has reiterated the ANC's commitment to  nationalizing mines, banks and other sectors of the economy, causing jitters in  markets here and worrying overseas investors.    De Klerk said such a policy does not make sense, especially in light of the  failure of state-controlled economies elsewhere in the world.    ""That will kill the goose that laid the golden egg,"" De Klerk said on  ""Nightline."" ""What is needed is a sound economic policy.""    Government officials said that their decision to legalize the ANC does not mean  they support its stand on nationalization.    The intent ""was to shift the fight against that policy from the field of  violence and suppressive measures to open political debate,"" said Gerrit  Viljoen, the government minister of constitutional development.

CHURCH JOINS MANDELA REVELRY;    REACTION: SOUTHLAND ACTIVISTS HOLD AN ALL-NIGHT VIGIL TO CELEBRATE THE EVENTS  IN SOUTH AFRICA.      By JOHN H. LEE and JOCELYN Y. STEWART, TIMES STAFF WRITERS      They had waited throughout the night and into the dawn Sunday at Los Angeles'  First African Methodist Episcopal Church. When the moment came, shortly after 6  a.m. here, it was as sweet as promised.    As the image of a freed Nelson R. Mandela flashed on TV screens in First AME's  crowded annex, the roomful of revelers surged. First came a deafening cheer,  then fists started pumping into the air.    A cappella strains of the black anthem ""Lift Every Voice and Sing"" were drowned  out by shouts of ""Free at last, Mandela!""    Half a world away, amid a similar throng of South African supporters, Mandela  looked up, smiled, then waved.    The image of the African National Congress leader walking away from his Cape  Town prison evoked tears from many of the 200 anti-apartheid activists who  huddled around television sets at the church in Los Angeles' West Adams  district.    At every glimpse of the 71-year-old man whose plight had become a symbol of  oppression suffered by black South Africa, the group cheered.    The room then slipped into a graceful sway that matched the rhythm of freedom  anthems led by organizers from more than a dozen student and activist groups.    Starting at 6 p.m. Saturday, the gathering had waited for the early-morning  release of Mandela. During the night, speakers from around the county and some  recently from South Africa described conditions under the government system  that kept Mandela imprisoned for more than 27 years.    Walimu Evans, 47, founder of the Nelson R. Mandela Educational Institute in  Compton, said she named her nursery and elementary school after the ANC leader  because she ""was impressed that Mandela stayed true to what he believed.""    ""I wanted the kids to learn about sticking with what they believe and that by  (doing so) they can eventually succeed.""    Mandela has made an impression on even her youngest students, including Nia  Ujamaa, 8, a fourth-grader at the institute who came to the vigil with her  godmother.    ""I know that he is a freedom fighter and that he was put in jail for trying to  help the people who are like slaves in South Africa,"" Nia said at about 2:30  a.m. Sunday.    As the girl picked up a sleeping bag and pillow and trooped upstairs to take a  nap, she added, ""I also know that his being free means the other people can be  free too.""    Between speakers during the vigil, an African traditional dance company from  Los Angeles provided impromptu performances.    ""The world needs a lot of healing,"" said Nzingha Camara, director of Le Ballet  de Kouman Kele, which specializes in a West African form of ""healing dance""  called lambda. ""Mandela is one who is trying to heal the ills of South Africa.  That's why we wanted to do lambda tonight.""    After the revelry that had surrounded Mandela's release began to subside, some  people voiced words of caution.    ""It's too premature to say that the system is really changing,"" said Sam  Phillips, 41, a performing arts teacher who left South Africa in 1987. ""What  (Mandela's release) does do is signify that a black man can fight to the end. I  see it as a sign that the struggle is intensifying.""    Lebo Morake, a member of the student group Themba (Hope), told the audience  that the apartheid system that separates its victims according to race must be  challenged by all those who are oppressed.    ""Unity is our number one weapon,"" Morake said. ""It is in fact our only weapon.""    After the vigil, celebrations over Mandela's release continued.    During two crowded church services at First AME, sermons by ministers were  sprinkled with references to his release. A choir member interrupted her solo  to praise Mandela. After the services, members of the congregation walked  through the neighborhood displaying a placard that read: ""Mandela Is Free.""    In the afternoon, 300 protesters marched in front of the South African  Consulate in Beverly Hills in a demonstration organized by the Southern  California chapter of the African National Congress. They covered the front of  the building with black, green and gold ANC flags.    Protesters demanded that the consulate vacate its offices and that the City of  Beverly Hills rename the building. As the demands were recited, protesters  unfurled a banner that read: ""Welcome to Nelson Mandela Square.""

The room then slipped into a graceful sway that matched the rhythm of freedom  anthems led by organizers from more than a dozen student and activist groups.    Starting at 6 p.m. Saturday, the gathering had waited for the early-morning  release of Mandela. During the night, speakers from around the county and some  recently from South Africa described conditions under the government system  that kept Mandela imprisoned for more than 27 years.    Walimu Evans, 47, founder of the Nelson R. Mandela Educational Institute in  Compton, said she named her nursery and elementary school after the ANC leader  because she ""was impressed that Mandela stayed true to what he believed.""    ""I wanted the kids to learn about sticking with what they believe and that by  (doing so) they can eventually succeed.""    Mandela has made an impression on even her youngest students, including Nia  Ujamaa, 8, a fourth-grader at the institute who came to the vigil with her  godmother.    ""I know that he is a freedom fighter and that he was put in jail for trying to  help the people who are like slaves in South Africa,"" Nia said at about 2:30  a.m. Sunday.    As the girl picked up a sleeping bag and pillow and trooped upstairs to take a  nap, she added, ""I also know that his being free means the other people can be  free too.""    Between speakers during the vigil, an African traditional dance company from  Los Angeles provided impromptu performances.    ""The world needs a lot of healing,"" said Nzingha Camara, director of Le Ballet  de Kouman Kele, which specializes in a West African form of ""healing dance""  called lambda. ""Mandela is one who is trying to heal the ills of South Africa.  That's why we wanted to do lambda tonight.""    After the revelry that had surrounded Mandela's release began to subside, some  people voiced words of caution.    ""It's too premature to say that the system is really changing,"" said Sam  Phillips, 41, a performing arts teacher who left South Africa in 1987. ""What  (Mandela's release) does do is signify that a black man can fight to the end. I  see it as a sign that the struggle is intensifying.""    Lebo Morake, a member of the student group Themba (Hope), told the audience  that the apartheid system that separates its victims according to race must be  challenged by all those who are oppressed.    ""Unity is our number one weapon,"" Morake said. ""It is in fact our only weapon.""    After the vigil, celebrations over Mandela's release continued.    During two crowded church services at First AME, sermons by ministers were  sprinkled with references to his release. A choir member interrupted her solo  to praise Mandela. After the services, members of the congregation walked  through the neighborhood displaying a placard that read: ""Mandela Is Free.""    In the afternoon, 300 protesters marched in front of the South African  Consulate in Beverly Hills in a demonstration organized by the Southern  California chapter of the African National Congress. They covered the front of  the building with black, green and gold ANC flags.    Protesters demanded that the consulate vacate its offices and that the City of  Beverly Hills rename the building. As the demands were recited, protesters  unfurled a banner that read: ""Welcome to Nelson Mandela Square.""

Mr Buthelezi said he wanted to talk only peace with Mr  Mandela. ""There is no question of me being persuaded by him or  anyone to ensure the IFP's participation in the elections,"" Mr  Buthelezi said in a memorandum prepared for delivery to National  Peace Secretariat Chairman Dr Antonie Gildenhuys in Ulundi on  Monday. ""I have nothing further to talk about on this issue,  particularly with Mr Mandela...I hope he does not waste his time  by trying to persuade me to accept this.""    Mr Buthelezi said Tuesday's meeting was a follow-up to their  peace summit in June last year when they agreed, among other  things, to address rallies together. But this had not happened,  he said, in spite of meeting ANC Chairman and Deputy  Secretary-General Thabo Mbeki and Jacob Zuma in September, 1993  when they discussed possible dates for the joint public  addresses. ""I gave them October 16 and 17 as being possible  dates...I have heard nothing further from them until last week  when Mr Zuma contacted me about tomorrow's (Tuesday's) meeting.""    Mr Buthelezi criticised Mr Mandela for what he described as  an offensive statement that he, Mr Mandela, was prepared to go  on his knees to the IFP president to prevent bloodshed. ""The  insinuation...that I am responsible for the bloodshed, I throw  at him with the contempt that it deserves.""    Mr Mandela was also reported as saying he wanted to persuade  Mr Buthelezi to participate in the April poll. ""I am prepared  to co-operate with Mr Mandela in any efforts that we agree can  end or reduce the levels of violence,"" Mr Buthelezi said.    On the election, the IFP leader said his party would not  participate because of the interim constitution which did not  allow regions to have exclusive powers. He said Mr Mandela had  also told him during their June meeting the ANC was opposed to a  federal system. ""We do not accept the constitution. We do not  intend entering the elections. And indeed we oppose the  constitution and the election with every democratic means at our  disposal.""    But, Mr Buthelezi said, he alone could not make a decision  to  participate in the elections. ""It is an IFP matter as much as  it is a Freedom Alliance issue. I want there to be no illusions  about this, and understanding this before our meeting tomorrow  will contribute a lot to making our meeting fruitful and  meaningful.""     "

Mr Mandela said he had also talked to Justice Minister Kobie  Coetsee and Police Commissioner Gen Johan van der Merwe. ""I was  convinced they want to put an end to the violence.""    Speaking at Hillbrow Hospital after visiting some of the  victims of Sunday's Johannesburg blast, Mr Mandela said the  proof of this would be in the implementation. ""I am convinced  tough measures if applied can bring these people to book. I  hope what we discussed will be implemented firmly. I hope the  government acts in a way to remove the impression it's a  government of weaklings.""    Nine people were killed and nearly 100 injured in Sunday's  car bomb explosion in Johannesburg. Twelve explosions in all  have occurred since Saturday, including another massive blast at  a Germiston black taxi rank on Monday morning which killed 10  people and injured 36.    The ANC president said the security forces were doing the  best they could in difficult circumstances and he hoped their  response following his latest talks with the government ""will  raise the confidence of the public"".    The forces of peace were far stronger than those who wished  to cause violence, he said. ""We are one country and one  people... I want you to look to the future with hope and  confidence."" People should turn up in large numbers to vote to  show their defiance to those who did not want the elections.    The country's first all-race election begins on Tuesday.    Inside the hospital, Mr Mandela spoke to some of the victims  of the Johannesburg blast including 29-year-old David Maimela,  who told SAPA he was visiting his girlfriend when it occured. ""I  think it's very bad. It's not right to try to stop the  elections. This is the first time we are going to vote."" Mr  Maimela's one ankle was fractured and his forehead was lacerated  by shrapnel.    Thirty-three-year-old Eric Ngxalose, short-order cook at a  Midtown fast food outlet, was coming to work when the bomb,  estimated to have comprised 70-90kg of explosives, went off. Mr  Ngxalose's leg was injured.    Mr Levy Khumalo, 51, was also hit by shrapnel. A resident of  Jeppe Hostel, he was in town on Sunday morning to visit his  children, who sell clothes in the city centre. Speaking through  a Zulu interpreter, Mr Khumalo told SAPA he was shocked by the  explosion. ""I was not expecting that."" He told nurses he did  not want to see Mr Mandela, and his bed was curtained off when  the ANC leader arrived.     "

Addressing the crowd outside the African  National Congress headquarters in Plein St, Mr Mandela said he  would not accept them acting like gangsters. He said he had  heard that bread had been stolen from a nearby bakery, and that  a police vehicle had been damaged. Mr Mandela said he did not  want an army of criminals, but a disciplined force.    The would-be army recruits camped outside the ANC  headquarters on Monday and vowed to stay there until the ANC  agreed to talk to them. They said they had been turned away from  the SA [South African] National Defence Force [SANDF] assembly  point at Wallmannstahl, near Pretoria, after being told they  were not on the ANC list of recruits.    They told SAPA: ""We registered. Now suddenly we are no  longer registered. Some of us left school and our jobs to join  the army. What are we supposed to do now? We have no money for  food or accommodation.""    Bags, luggage and personal belongings were strewn around the  entrance to the ANC head office.    ""We have been here since 4AM, and some have been sleeping  out  here for the past two weeks, living on handouts.""    A woman said some of them were Umkhonto We Sizwe (MK) [Spear  of the Nation, ANC armed wing] members, while others had left  work or school. ""We are not going anywhere until the ANC speaks  to us. We want to be part of the SANDF,"" she said.    ""We can't go back to school or tech because registration is  over. We left our schools and now we are just dumped,"" said a  young man.    MK Commissar Andrew Masondo said on Monday the crowd was  being ""impatient"". He said MK had submitted a list of its  members to be retrained at Wallmannstahl for integration into  the SANDF, which had to be thoroughly checked.    When it was pointed out to Mr Masondo that many of the crowd  were not MK members and had left school or jobs to join the  army, he said: ""The list is for MK members. If the others just  want to join the army, they should apply like everyone else  does. You don't have to join the army via MK.""    Officers said that of the 6,200 people who originally  reported to Wallmannstahl, nearly 3,000 had been turned away  because they were not on the ANC's list.    On Tuesday, Mr Mandela appeared and urged the crowd to  follow  proper induction procedures and to approach regional ANC  structures for inclusion in the armed forces.    More exiled soldiers are expected to arrive in South Africa  this week.     "

Speaking on  Thursday [3 March] after a meeting with Organisation of African  Unity Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim in Umtata in Transkei,  Mr Mandela said a Zulu homeland was a point raised during his  meeting with Inkatha Freedom Party President Mangosuthu  Buthelezi earlier this week. ""I indicated to Mr Buthelezi this  was a matter we were prepared to discuss directly with the king  and we requested Mr Buthelezi to arrange a meeting. We are  awaiting a response,"" Mr Mandela said.    The ANC had decided in principle to accept international  mediation, but it had not yet discussed the structure through  which this would take place. ""But the principle has been  formally accepted and we have conveyed this fact to Mr  Buthelezi,"" he said.    Mr Mandela said he had briefed Mr Salim on the latest  political developments during their hour-long meeting in the  offices of the Transkei Military Council in Umtata. Mr Salim  said he had been encouraged by the discussions he had had with  Mr Mandela, Mr Buthelezi, State President F W de Klerk, the Pan  Africanist Congress leadership and the Afrikaner Volksfront  [Afrikaner National Front]. ""What has encouraged me more is the  meeting the president of the ANC had with Mr Buthelezi. From  all indications, it was very constructive. I believe and I'm  hopeful that arising from the serious discussions and  understandings arrived at there, the prospects for the country  are certainly brightened,"" Mr Salim said.    The OAU looked forward to a peaceful election. A successful  outcome was vital not only to the people of South Africa, but to  the continent as a whole. The attention of the international  community was focused on this country, he said. ""We want to see  an emergent, stable South Africa which can play a central role  in Africa and can be an important factor of stability for our  continent,"" Mr Salim said.     "

Interviewed in Johannesburg today, he said  the political climate and not the election date should be  changed, and ANC President Nelson Mandela has supported this  saying he won't agree to a postponement of the election as this  would effectively be a postponement of freedom. Yesterday, a  joint IEC-kwaZulu and South African Government working committee  said an election couldn't be held in kwaZulu-Natal in the  current political climate.

[Mandela] There will be no postponement of the election.  [applause]    [Correspondent] On the possible postponement of regional  election in Natal-kwaZulu he kept the same strong stance. Later  at a news conference Mr. Mandela said the IEC report stated that  a final decision was still in the hands of political leaders.  He said Friday's summit meeting for him was an opportunity to  discuss the position of King Goodwill Zwelithini.    [Mandela] The main purpose is to see how I can address his  concerns and to allay his feeling that his position is  threatened by the government of national unity.    [Correspondent] Mr. Mandela said he believed the ongoing  violence in the province might be reduced if an agreement could  be reached with King Goodwill.

Speaking at the funeral service of his former co-accused and  fellow Robben Island prisoner Elias Motsoaledi in Soweto, Mr  Mandela said delivering on the ANC election promises was the  best tribute to the victims of apartheid and its stalwarts.    The RDP programme came under criticism this week, with  experts predicting it would cost between 80 and 90 billion rand,  more than twice the initial ANC costing of 39 billion rand over  five years. He said the ANC-led government of national unity was  constituted by people from different backgrounds, with genuine  and well-meaning white colleagues not used to huge expenditures  to meet the needs of African people.    Defending the RDP, Mr Mandela said the ANC leadership came  from a background of squalor and misery and understood the  deprivation of black South Africans better than their white  colleagues who had had a wealthy and comfortable upbringing.  ""Delivery on the RDP should not threaten the property of  minorities and their living standards, but have to meet the  expectations of people within a reasonable space of time.    ""There are minorities in this country who believe the  implementation of this programme will lead to falling living  standards.""    But he added that a balance had to be maintained between  uplifting the black majority and not destroying the wealth the  country already had.    While there was broad agreement, the ANC leadership would  have to take the initiative for delivering quality education,  electricity and water in urban and rural areas, he added.    Mr Mandela took off time from his tight schedule to share  his  experiences with Mr Motsoaledi during their long spell of  imprisonment on Robben Island. Paying tribute to a comrade and  their long friendship, he said Mr Motsoaledi had helped ordinary  people regain their pride and dignity and had inspired hope. ""We  are honouring a man who helped to end South Africa's isolation.""    ""Motsoaledi was a non-conformist. He did not agree with  ideas  unless he considered them carefully.    ""He was a founder of Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation]  (the ANC's armed wing) and was crucial in recruiting and sending  young people out the country for military training.""    He said Mr Motsoaledi's experiences should inspire young  people to know that an ordinary person without education could  pull himself up by his bootstraps to assume the stature of a  national figure.    Among those gathered at the stadium to pay their last  respects were former prison mates Pan Africanist Congress  President Clarence Makwetu, ANC stalwart Walter Sisulu, First  Deputy Preisdent Thabo Mbeki and human rights lawyer George  Bizos.

0,FT942-5013 ,"FT942-5013 _AN-EFHA0AC2FT 940607   FT  07 JUN 94 / Arts: Happy Days      By ALASTAIR MACAULAY   What do we mean by stasis in drama? Winnie, the heroine of Samuel Beckett's Happy Days is visually almost as immobile as any protagonist since Aeschylus's Prometheus Bound: embedded in a mound of earth - in Act One up to her waist, in Act Two up to her neck. Nor does she progress psychologically. What one recalls most are the phrases on which she harps - 'That is what I find so wonderful'; 'Ah yes, great mercies'; 'Another happy day' - time and again. And yet this is not, for us, a static play. All Winnie's repetitions help us to know her better, and to lead us more intimately into the vast tragicomic situation which is larger than her. For Happy Days is a mortal's contemplations of the gradual diminuendo ending of life: 'loss of spirits, lack of keenness,' loss of memory, of sexuality, of energy, of hope. Against which Winnie's repeated little optimisms, staving off despair, become heroic. Beckett achieves this often by working on the most trivial scale. Winnie re-examines her toothbrush until, after whole minutes, she discerns all the legend 'Fully guaranteed genuine pure hog's setae.' Whereupon she remarks 'That is what I find so wonderful, that not a day goes by - to speak in the old style - hardly a day, without some addition to one's knowledge however trifling, the addition I mean, provided one takes the pains. And if for some strange reasons no further pains are possible, why then just close the eyes  -and wait for the day to come - the happy day when flesh melts at so many degrees and the night of the moon has so many hundred hours . . . That is what I find so comforting when I lose heart and envy the brute beast.' So many of these phrases we have already heard from her lips, and will hear again, that the full impact of these sentences hardly hits us at the time. Yet it is the repetitions that matter most, for they represent Winnie's Canute-like efforts to defy the incoming waves of oblivion. I am, mind you, speaking here of Happy Days itself, and not of the specific performance it is currently receiving at the French Institute. Angela Pleasance gives Winnie an accent so precisely filled with lower-middle-class English nuance, that it is as if she took a Jane Clark view of Winnie. Her voice and face condescend to impersonate Winnie, tiptoeing quaintly below stairs for every separate inflection. Her director, the French Simone Benmussa, may well be tone-deaf to the English class connotations of Pleasance's performance. But Benmussa must be aware of some of the extensive artifice employed by Pleasance, and by Peter Bayliss in the small role of Willie. No doubt it is Benmussa who has encouraged Pleasance to speak the whole play on a near-inaudible thread of voice. This sustained pianissimo would be daring and compelling were Pleasance suggesting a larger-souled Winnie. Not so, however. As Pleasance delivers it, Happy Days is simply the slow extinction of what used to be called the soul of a housemaid. The play, however, is so much larger and more enthralling that you can listen to its words and imagine, so to speak, the play beyond this meagre performance. Happy Days remains one of the great plays of the century. At the French Institute   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P7929 Entertainers and Entertainment Groups.

Speaking on his  arrival in Tunis for the OAU summit meeting, Mr. Mandela said  South Africa's capabilities for meeting requests from other  African countries were limited. He pointed out that the new  government was still finding its feet.    Mr. Mandela's remarks coincided with reports that he is  expected to play a key role in attempts to end the slaughter in  Rwanda. The three-day summit meeting is expected to be  dominated by the Rwandan question. Other issues expected to be  discussed by the leaders of the 53 member states are Africa's  enormous debt, ethnic conflict, religious tension, the rise of  Islamic fundamentalism, and the failure of economic institutions  in some regions.    President Mandela held talks with King Hassan of Morocco on  his way to Tunis. He first visited Tunisia in 1962 to ask for  MK [Umkhonto we Sizwe -- Spear of the Nation; ANC military wing]  soldiers to be trained.

South Africa's minerals belonged to the State and mining  companies should lease the right to exploit these and pay  consideration to the State, he told mineworkers on the last day  of the National Union of Mineworkers' national congress in  Pretoria. The people would own the mineral rights, with the  State acting as a custodian, he said.    This idea was first mooted by the ANC in its Reconstruction  and Development Programme recently, and was met with widespread  concern. The gold index plunged 98 points, to 2060, in one  trading session, but recovered following Mandela's statement  that the initial announcement was ""unfortunate.""    He seems to have come full circle in response to changes in  legislation which became effective this year. Mandela accused  the Government of transferring ownership of mineral rights to  mining houses once aware that a new order would replace them.    ""This was a conspiracy between mining houses and the NP  [National Party]. But we will not allow that to happen. A  democratic government will change every agreement between the NP  and the mining houses."" And the right to mine should not be  exclusive to mining houses but should be extended to  individuals, he added.    In a wide-ranging speech, Mandela said an ANC government  would honour the right of workers to unionise and strike. ""It  will be the first duty of an ANC government. The right to  strike is a democratic right of workers through the country,"" he  said.    In a stinging attack on the NP, Mandela said the party did  not have a conception of how to serve all South Africans. ""They  don't know what it is to serve everyone.""    Mandela paid tribute to the police, from the upper echelons  to the Internal Stability Unit, especially in Natal. ""We have  men and women who are committed to the building of a new South  Africa. Their problem is politicians who do dishonourable  things.""     "

He told a  crowd of more than 100,000 squashed into a field outside Kings  Park Stadium that the ANC had taken precautions against chaos  after elections. He did not elaborate.    ""We have taken precautions in advance to ensure there is no  looting or interference in people's private property. We're  developing creative programmes in which people are taking part.    ""Nothing is going to happen to the property of any family,  black or white. We're taking precautions because we want a South  Africa of national reconciliation, peace and unity.""    The ANC president branded as ""prophets of doom"" those  predicting anarchy after the elections. In a direct appeal to  whites not to leave South Africa, Mr Mandela said: ""I appeal to  whites in particular not to fear the future."" The ANC  recognised the decisive role whites could play in rebuilding the  country, he said, adding that skills they had acquired had  become ""the most valuable asset in this country"".    Mr Mandela said he felt hurt by reports of whites leaving  South Africa and made an ""earnest appeal from a man who has  spent 27 year in jail"" for them to stay.""All of you in this  country: Africans, coloureds, whites and Indians, this is your  country. This is our country.    ""We appeal to those communities, who have benefited under  apartheid, do not leave us in the lurch at this critical moment.""    A confident Mr Mandela brushed aside the Johannesburg car  bomb and the Ulundi killings at the weekend, merely saying he  would take up these issues in discussions with State President F  W de Klerk on Sunday night. He told the cheering crowd he did  not want to concentrate on violence by those wanting to disrupt  elections.    ""We're going to deal with these issues. We've made enormous  progress despite the attempts of criminals.    ""Leave the task of dealing with law and order with the  security forces.""    The ANC president, however, criticised the security forces  for not confining the KwaZulu Police to barracks or weeding out  alleged hit-squads in that force, saying these issues had been  among the reasons for declaring a state of emergency in  KwaZulu/Natal. ""The SADF [South African Defense Force] and SAP  [South African Police] have done nothing of these things except  to run round in the streets.""    Addressing indemnity for elements of the security forces, he  said the ANC would consider indemnifying those members who had  committed politically-linked offences between October 1990 and  December last year, but would not pardon those responsible for  current violence.    ""I want to state very clearly that those people involved in  killing members of the ANC in Ulundi, no matter what position  they hold, will be dealt with according to the law,"" he told the  cheering crowd.    ""They must pay for those crimes and they are going to pay.""    Mr Mandela repeated that the National Party [NP] had no  chance of winning this week's election and slammed the NP for  emulating the ANC's election slogans and for claiming to be the  only party which could stop the ANC. The NP's statement came  while the whole world was ready to assist an ANC-led government  and amounted to stopping the ANC from ""bettering the lives of  all"".    The ANC was ready to govern and the people of South Africa  were ready to rid the country of minority rule, Mr Mandela told  a media conference after the rally. ""They are not bluffed by the  National Party.""    He said earlier the NP had used South Africa's cultural  diversity to divide people while the ANC regarded the cultural  mix as one of the country's strongest assets.    Reassuring minorities, the ANC leader said majority rule did  not mean ""black majority rule"". ""All of you must pledge to be  part of the majority, not the minority. The National Party is a  government of the minority and can never be a government of  majority in this country.    ""I would urge our white counterparts to have confidence in  the future. Stay here and help us.""    Questioned on his feelings on the dawn of democracy in South  Africa, he replied: ""I feel elated. At the same time, I feel  sad,"" explaining that many people who had made freedom possible  were not alive to see it happen.     "

Insofar as  Mandela is urging his about-to-be Cabinet partners to serve  reconstruction (small r) and go in for development (small d),  good and well. If he is insisting that they unquestioningly  imbibe a party programme with which they have major arithmetical  difficulty, not so. 'National Unity' cannot merely mean  permitting a token opposition presence in the Cabinet room. It  must mean two-way adjustment. Most adjusting, fair to say, must  come from the minority parties; but not all. Mandela seems to  see his partners as a set of voluntary hostages. He must revise  that view before it leads to tears.""    BUSINESS DAY    Mandela's `Curious' Cabinet Appointments -- The page-12  editorial in Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 9 May  comments on President Nelson Mandela's ""more curious provisional  Cabinet appointments."" The ""impending reappointment of Derek  Keys to the Finance portfolio is, from business's perspective, a  bonus. With Reserve Bank Governor Chris Stals's mid-year  reappointment already as good as confirmed, Mandela probably  need not have gone that far to convince business of his good  intentions."" However, Mandela should realize that Keys ""is not,  like some other NP [National Party] Cabinet possibilities, a yes  man. A discordant note was struck in Mandela's victory speech  on Monday, when he warned that Cabinet partners would have to  accept the ANC's reconstruction and development programme,  failing which there would be serious strains. Yes, the ANC has  a clear mandate to make the RDP the basis of the new  government's programme, but Keys will put his foot down if he  believes it necessary in the interest of good fiscal management.  Mandela should not take that as a sign of hostility to  reconstruction and development per se. And, if Keys felt  compelled to resign over such a dispute, the effects on investor  confidence could be dire."" BUSINESS DAY believes Alfred Nzo was  appointed foreign minister as ""a reward for past services, but  he is ""likely to be ineffectual in Foreign Affairs."" ""The two  main security portfolios -- Defence and Police -- are the most  worrying. Prospective Police Minister Sidney Mufamadi's  three-year reign as head of the ANC's peace desk was uninspired  as the country descended into violence. Proposed Defence  Minister Joe Modise is held in high esteem only by factions of  Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation; ANC military wing] and a  few others. Assuming the NP is still fighting for one of these  two posts, it would do Mandela no harm to concede the point.""  ""There are, in the end, two grounds for consolation regarding  Mandela's less-inspired choices. Weak ministers can be carried  if they have competent directors-general and other senior  officials. They can also be removed at the President's will.""     "

By SCOTT KRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER      CAPE TOWN, South Africa      The government said Thursday that the security concerns holding up the release  of jailed nationalist leader Nelson R. Mandela include threats against his life  from both radical left-wing blacks and right-wing whites.    ""We want him to get out of that prison and walk the streets of our country as a  free man . . . and alive,"" said Adriaan Vlok, the government minister of law  and order. He added that arrangements for Mandela's protection have not been  completed, but will be made in consultation with the prisoner.    President Frederik W. de Klerk said last week that Mandela's security and  unspecified ""personal circumstances"" were the main things delaying the  71-year-old African National Congress leader's release after more than 27 years  in prison. However, anti-apartheid activists say the government may also be  stalling while it studies reaction to De Klerk's reform package and considers  meeting more of the ANC's conditions for negotiations.    De Klerk and his Cabinet ministers are counting on Mandela to help them get  negotiations with the black majority under way. Mandela has used his position  from inside South Africa's prison system to play the role of facilitator for  talks between the government and the ANC.    But Mandela is said to have made it clear to the government that the ANC will  not sit at the table with De Klerk until he lifts the 3 1/2-year-old state of  emergency and releases political prisoners. Fifteen activists, including  Mandela, are serving life terms, and 2,500 are imprisoned for shorter terms for  politically inspired crimes.    Both the ANC and the government worry about Mandela's safety once he is freed.  The government is considering round-the-clock police protection for Mandela, if  he wants it, Vlok said. He added that allowing armed ANC members to protect  Mandela is also being studied.    Police declined to specify the threats against Mandela. But Vlok said that  threats from the right have increased in recent weeks and ""most of their  threats are centered around his release."" Militant right-wing groups, who are  few but well-armed, say Mandela is a terrorist whose freedom will incite  violence among blacks.    Over the last two years, Vlok said, police investigators have heard threats  from black factions who are upset that Mandela has been playing the role of  facilitator with the government.    That is one of the reasons the government has advanced for maintaining its  remaining emergency regulations.    Vlok told Parliament on Thursday that the emergency is still needed because of  the ""extremely explosive political situation in the country at present.""    ""There are too many irresponsible people who are only too eager to take  advantage of existing problem areas in a reckless way,"" Vlok said. ""The  revolutionary climate is still unnaturally high.""

The team is defying an international ban on sports contact with South  Africa.    Police said eight journalists covering the clash were briefly detained when  they refused to leave. De Klerk ended most restrictions on press coverage of  unrest last Friday, but the police said they were acting under other emergency  regulations that empower them to order anyone to leave any area.    Police later used clubs to break up a smaller protest involving about a hundred  people outside a Johannesburg building housing the British Consulate.

A working committee, comprising  representatives from the IEC and the South African and kwaZulu  governments, concluded on Tuesday that several factors, linked  to the politically charged climate in kwaZulu, would render free  and fair elections improbable.    These included high levels of political intolerance and  intimidation and the fact the kwaZulu civil service and tribal  structures were unable to assist the process for a free and fair  election.    ANC spokesman Ronnie Mamoepa said Wednesday's meeting with  Mr  Mandela would centre on the IEC announcement, and ""give full  consideration to the implication of that announcement and  provide a preliminary response"".    ""The present climate of violence makes it impossible for  free  and fair elections (in Natal and kwaZulu) but it is too early to  make a decision.""    Mr Mamoepa said a full statement will be issued after the  internal meeting.    Meanwhile, IEC Chairman Justice Johan Kriegler said a  decision on whether elections could be postponed in Natal or  not, was a political one, which lay outside of the IEC's ambit  of jurisdiction.    The matter is expected to be high on the agenda of Friday's  summit between F W de Klerk, Nelson Mandela, Mangosuthu  Buthelezi, and Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini.    Mr Mandela travelled to Durban on Wednesday to address a  youth conference at the University of Durban-Westville, and will  then meet with the leadership of Natal's three ANC regions.    ANC Midlands spokesman Dr Blade Nzimande said the meeting  would focus on elections in Natal and ""yesterday's (Tuesday)  development gives it an added significance"".    The SA Congress of Trade Unions and the SA Communist Party  will also attend the meeting, which comes amid spiralling  violence in the province.    Since the declaration of the state of emergency last  Thursday, about 100 people have died in political bloodletting  in Natal, and last month's toll reached nearly 300 -- the  highest recorded in several years.

After 10 hours of talks, Mr Mandela, leader of the African National Congress, emerged grim-faced to say that the two men had not been able to agree on an election date. The setting of a date, and the installation of a transitional executive to oversee government before elections, are preconditions for the lifting of international economic sanctions against South Africa. Mr Mandela had hoped to announce an election date when he visits the US next week with Mr F W de Klerk, the president. He said he believed a breakthrough on this issue could still be achieved in the 26-party constitutional talks, but this seemed unlikely without the agreement of Chief Buthelezi. Mr Mandela said the two men had made 'a great deal of progress' towards ending political violence between supporters of the ANC and of Chief Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom Party. They said they would address joint peace rallies to persuade their supporters to cease fighting which has left over 15,000 people dead since 1984. In Natal province alone, 45 people died in the three days before the talks. Both also committed themselves to banning dangerous weapons at political rallies, a leading demand of the ANC. However, it seems unlikely that the meeting will lead to an early cessation of hostilities. As South Africans prepare for their first-ever multi-racial elections, provisionally set for April next year, political violence seems likely to increase, notably in volatile Natal. Chief Buthelezi said the meeting would have great symbolic significance. He had, however, opened the talks with a lengthy memorandum listing personal grievances against Mr Mandela and the ANC. He said they had assassinated his character.   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.   Industries:-  P9199 General Government, NEC.     P8651 Political Organizations.

The emotional outpouring of support for the 71-year-old leader and his wife,  Winnie, began the moment they set foot on a red carpet at Kennedy International  Airport, where they were embraced by black and white political leaders from  three states and applauded by a crowd bathed in the black, green and gold  colors of Mandela's movement, the African National Congress.    ""You, the wonderful citizens of New York, have demonstrated in the most visible  manner that we, the oppressed people of South Africa and the ANC, are admired  and respected (and) that it is the dying apartheid system that is totally  isolated,"" Mandela told a crowd on the steps of City Hall, where he accepted  the key to the city from Mayor David N. Dinkins.    ""(We) are overwhelmed by the extraordinary reception that we have received,""  said Mandela, dressed in a blue suit. He was accompanied by his wife, who was  wrapped in a traditional red-and-white African dashiki. ""No . . . words can  ever express the deep emotions I feel at this moment.""    New York Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, who rode with the Mandelas on the parade route,  described the hero's welcome as ""the single most memorable thing I've ever  witnessed,"" and he attributed it to the couple's ""strength, their  indomitability. It is what they demonstrate that you can do when your heart is  filled with righteous passion.""    ""It was a colossal shout in one magnificent voice, to say to the world that  it's time for the chains to be thrown off. Put an end to apartheid in South  Africa. Put an end to the evil,"" Cuomo said.    Mandela's motorcade from the airport wound through neighborhoods of Brooklyn,  scene of some of New York's recent racial strife, where throngs lined the  roadway and pressed forward to touch the black limousine carrying the man  Dinkins later called a ""modern-day Moses"" for blacks worldwide.    Mandela then climbed into a special vehicle with large bulletproof windows and,  thickly surrounded by dozens of uniformed and plainclothes security officers,  moved up the narrow skyscraper canyon of lower Manhattan as it rained tons of  scraps of paper, including some authentic pre-computer age ticker tape imported  from Connecticut.    As Mandela and his wife waved to the noisy revelers, fists shot into the air  with the traditional salute of the ANC, the liberation movement that, until a  ban was lifted in February, had been outlawed by the white authorities in South  Africa for 30 years.    Construction workers waved their hats, schoolchildren carried signs reading:  ""Hooray You're Free!"" and black as well as white office workers in suits and  ties applauded from open windows. Some even ventured out onto narrow ledges  high above the street in New York's financial district.    Police estimated the crowds at 750,000 and said there were no major incidents.  A contingent of 12,000 police officers, some using bomb-sniffing dogs, was  deployed to guarantee Mandela's safety. The $2-million tab, mostly for  overtime, was being picked up by the federal government.    ""There's a nice, warm feeling of camaraderie here today,"" said Rabbi Gilbert S.  Rosenthal, executive vice president of the New York Board of Rabbis, as the  motorcade passed. ""It's a great welcome for a great hero.""    Another spectator, Lorenzo Grooms, 19, standing ankle-deep in shredded paper,  was exultant. ""It was incredible -- he looked right in our face,"" Grooms said.    Among the other dignitaries who crowded a platform erected in front of City  Hall were movie director Spike Lee, Dick Gregory, Harry Belafonte, the Rev.  Jesse Jackson and former New York Mayor Edward I. Koch.    Mandela's 12-day, 8-city visit to the United States, which includes a stop next  week in Los Angeles, has been heralded by ANC leaders as an opportunity to  thank Americans for their support and urge them to pressure President Bush and  Congress to maintain economic sanctions against Pretoria until the last  vestiges of apartheid are gone.    Mandela has meetings scheduled next week with Bush and will address a joint  session of Congress. Mandela's New York schedule includes an address at the  United Nations and several fund-raisers, from a $5-a-seat rally at Yankee  Stadium tonight to a $2,500-a-person dinner Friday.    After delivering three speeches during a whirlwind five hours, Mandela was  taken to the mayor's official residence, Gracie Mansion, where he spent the  night. Organizers of the journey, concerned about Mandela's health, canceled  several private evening meetings and a dinner party.    Roger Wilkins, national coordinator of the U.S. tour, said that, although  Mandela seemed well throughout the day, it had become clear after the last  speech at City Hall that ""he had reached a limit that shouldn't be pushed.""    And Wilkins said he has been urging local organizers in other cities to trim  Mandela's itinerary so that he will have more rest. ""We're probably going to  have to thin it out as we go,"" Wilkins said.    Mandela, who turns 72 on July 18, has traveled to dozens of countries since his  Feb. 11 release from a South African prison, where he had served 27 years of a  life sentence for founding the ANC's guerrilla campaign against the white  minority government in Pretoria. He underwent minor bladder surgery last month  and went on the road a day after his hospital discharge, beginning a six-week  trip that already has taken him through Europe and Canada.    The ANC leader, who suffers from high blood pressure, is traveling with a  doctor.    New York City came to a virtual standstill at midday when Mandela arrived,  about two hours late, aboard a Canadian government jet. Organizers blamed the  delay on the need to give Mandela more rest. New York television stations  broadcast continuous coverage of the ANC deputy president's every move,  preempting most of their daytime afternoon programming, and the city's tabloid  newspapers offered front-page headlines of welcome, with the Daily News saying:  ""Cry Freedom"" and New York Newsday announcing: ""It's Red Carpet Time.""    After being described in glowing terms by Dinkins and Cuomo, Mandela returned  the compliments, telling Dinkins that his election as the first black mayor of  New York ""filled me and our people with pride. We fully support your struggle  to heal the wounds of this city.""    Mandela said he had read about ""the powerful oratory and sharp analytical mind""  of Cuomo, ""and I must say now, having heard you speak, that what we heard is no  exaggeration.""    Mandela's 54-year-old wife, herself subjected to years of harassment, detention  and banishment by South Africa's authorities, addressed the crowd at City Hall  in one of her rare public speeches since her husband's release.    ""You have helped us go through the most difficult years in our struggle for  freedom,"" she said. And she thanked Americans ""for the solidarity you gave us  when we were in jail, when I was in (internal) exile and when I was in the  bigger prison called South Africa.""    Earlier, the Mandelas stopped in the heart of Brooklyn's predominantly black  Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood at a high school where an estimated 10,000  students and residents had turned out to see them -- and where their thoughts  were on the racial divisions in their own city.    ""Look at all my people!"" said Gloria Mingo Jackson, a Brooklyn schoolteacher.  ""We're together. We're not fighting. We're going to get it together as a  people. This is something I'm going to tell my grandchildren.""    Many of Mandela's fans said they especially admired him for his principled  stand in prison, where he had refused government offers of freedom in exchange  for a renunciation of the ANC's strategy of armed struggle.    ""He has given up his whole life"" for black liberation, said Erna Letemps, 21,  who had come from Orange, N.J., to see Mandela at the school. ""He knew what the  struggle was and he stuck to it.""    Among the crowd outside City Hall in Manhattan, 76-year-old James C. Campbell,  a sergeant in an all-black regiment during World War II, said he respected  Mandela for holding his ground over a principle.    Margaret Gadsden, a telephone operator, brought her four grandchildren ""to see  a hero."" She said: ""He's an important figure for us. I don't care what color  you are, we have to work together for equality. That's what this is all about.""    Mandela alternately urged continued sanctions against his country's government  and financial help for his organization, which is beginning the massive task of  re-establishing itself as a political entity inside South Africa. Although one  of many political organizations representing the voteless black majority in  South Africa, the ANC in the opinion of most analysts has the greatest support  among the 27 million blacks. The ANC supports one-person, one-vote rule on a  universal voters roll, and it has been slowly gaining support among the 5  million whites there.    ""We can see the light at the end of the tunnel,"" Mandela said Wednesday. ""We  are therefore appealing to you in all humility and in all sincerity that you  must join us"" by maintaining American sanctions against South Africa and  donating money to the ANC cause.    The ANC believes sanctions against Pretoria have forced President Frederik W.  de Klerk to initiate a series of rapid reforms in the past four months. De  Klerk's actions have freed up black political activity and lifted many of the  most onerous security measures used by the authorities to put down  anti-government protest. This week he also pushed through Parliament  legislation that eliminates one of the pillars of apartheid, the Separate  Amenities Act, which allows city councils in South Africa to segregate public  facilities such as libraries, recreation halls, parks and swimming pools.    However, other important apartheid laws, including those that mandate  segregated residential areas and schools, remain.    Zwelakhe Sisulu, one of Mandela's aides, predicted that ""a lot of black South  Africans are really going to feel good about what happened today, with black  and white people praising Mr. Mandela. And it's going to get a lot of white  people in South Africa thinking seriously about the future of their country.""    Staff writer Edwin Chen contributed to this story.

The Zulu monarch met Mr Mandela at an undisclosed venue before a  meeting between the king, Mr Mandela, President F W de Klerk and  Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi.    The king's presentation to Mr Mandela was released by Mr.  Buthelezi's office.    ""Until and unless you personally distance yourself from the  shedding of the innocent blood of my father's people by means of  your personal initiative leading to the conviction of those who  are guilty of this crime, our dialogue will remain difficult if  not impossible,"" King Zwelithini said.    King Zwelithini said immediate steps were required from Mr  Mandela to heal the wounds arising from the Shell House  massacre. He asked that Mr Mandela make available all  information related to the killings.    ""I ask that you do whatever is in your power as the  president  of the ANC to ensure that all those who plotted, organised and  executed the massacre are arrested and tried for their crime,""  he said.    The Zulu king also condemned ANC statements on the monarchy  and the kwaZulu government.    ""The insults that many spokespersons of the ANC, and  particularly the Natal leaders of the ANC, have hurled at me at  numerous times, that I am on the payroll of the kwaZulu  government or that my Prime Minister Prince Mangosuthu is my  paymaster, is something which is more than just offensive.""    He said any action taken against the kwaZulu legislative  assembly would be an action against him as reigning king.    He said Mr Mandela and the ANC had repeatedly flouted royal  protocol in their approaches to the institution of the Zulu  monarchy.    He detailed the failed attempts at arranging a meeting  between himself and Mr Mandela and said it would be wrong for  him not to get ""these things off my chest"".    However, he said he did not expect issues of protocol to  cloud the discussions. ""I put them down for the record without  expecting them to be the cause of any acrimony between us.""    King Zwelithini said he regarded the state of emergency in  Natal/kwaZulu as an invasion. ""I want to make it clear that I,  the king of the Zulu nation, consider the declaration of a state  of emergency in kwaZulu to be an act of foreign aggression, an  invasion of our territory and a rape of our national dignity and  pride.    ""I...shall never recognise the legitimacy of the actions  taken in terms of the declaration of the state of emergency.""    He said the stigmatisation of his uncle, Chief  Kwaphindangene  (Chief Minister Buthelezi) had also caused offence. ""It was he  who destroyed the South African Government's homeland policy,  and it was his refusal to accept so-called independence that  destroyed Mr John Vorster's and Mr P W Botha's dream of  establishing a confederation of South African states.""    King Zwelithini said the summit was taking place against the  background of two direct and intolerable attacks on the Zulu  nation -- the Shell House massacre and the state of emergency.    ""I have only done as much as is needed to clear things from  my heart so that we can talk openly and simply about the prime  purpose of our meeting"".    He said the purpose of the meeting was to discuss the  sovereignty of the Zulu kingdom. He said sovereignty could not  be negotiated or conferred upon kwaZulu by anybody.    ""Throughout the period of conquest and subjugation, it was  Zulu identity which kept the Zulus intact as a vibrant force  against colonialism and apartheid."" The Zulus had never been  crushed, he said.    He said sovereignty forged by history could not be undone  by political edict or by the passing of a law or by the forcing  of a constitution on the people of a sovereign kingdom. ""Now  that apartheid has been finally destroyed and a new South Africa  is being shaped, there shall emerge a sovereign Zulu kingdom.    ""I am not prepared to talk to you...about whether or not  there shall be a sovereign Zulu kingdom in the new South Africa.    ""The only thing to talk about are the modalities of bringing  the sovereignty of the Zulu kingdom into full recognitio and  relating the kingdom properly to the rest of South Africa.""    He said the kingdom would be bounded by the Transvaal in the  west, Mozambique and Swaziland in the north and Transkei and  Lesotho in the south and south-west.    He said the 1993 constitution, even as amended, extended the  ""greedy arm of Pretoria right across the Zulu kingdom"". He said  he rejected the constitution. He said the kingdom needed a  militia which the constitution did not provide.    King Zwelithini said he had been forced to act decisively by  the failure of negotiations to deliver a federal dispensation.  Nor was the negotiators' provision for traditional leaders  sufficient recognition of the Zulu monarchy.    ""As things stand now I cannot encourage my father's people  to  vote on April 26-28 and thereby lend legitimacy to what will be  the destruction of the very foundations on which the sovereignty  of the Zulu kingdom rests.""    He said Mr Mandela was rushing into an election rejected by  himself and the Zulu people.    King Zwelithini said a constitution had been written for the  state of kwaZulu/Natal in December, 1992. It set out the Zulu  nation's bottomline demands.    He said he had been hoping for a a federal system in which  the constitution would be recognised.    He called on all Zulus to unite and to defend kwaZulu  freedom  and sovereignty.    ""The road ahead is not going to be an easy one,"" he warned.    ""We the Zulu nation convene today on the battleground which  subjugated the freedom of our forefathers.    ""We here today proclaim before the world our freedom and  sovereignty and our unwavering will to defend it at all costs.    ""Whether we end up as part of one federal state of South  Africa or as a completely autonomous state will depend on what  you and others in South Africa do to me and my people. The key  thing is whether you are prepared to listen to our just  aspirations or whether, like those who conquered us, you think  you must trample with your feet on those just aspirations of my  nation.""

By SCOTT KRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER      CAPE TOWN, South Africa      Black nationalist Nelson R. Mandela and 22 leading anti-apartheid activists  discussed political strategy in a 5 1/2-hour session in his prison home near  here Friday, with participants quoting Mandela as saying he was optimistic that  the problems facing South Africa can be resolved peacefully.    But, in Johannesburg, a peaceful demonstration to celebrate President Frederik  W. de Klerk's week-old steps to open up political expression was marred when  police set upon activists departing the rally and beat some repeatedly with  batons.    The activists, dancing and singing liberation songs, were emerging from St.  Mary's Anglican Church onto downtown streets following a lunchtime service  beneath a church banner that read ""Let justice roll down like waters."" Police  gave them two minutes to disperse and then moved in, witnesses said.    The meeting with Mandela at Victor Verster prison farm reflected the unusual  dialogue that the imprisoned leader is conducting with black leaders and the  government behind prison walls.    ""He appears to be in total control"" of his discussions with the government,  said one of the delegates, Dullah Omar, a Mandela family lawyer and  anti-apartheid leader. But, the delegates said, the date of his release remains  in the hands of the government.    Mandela, who has served more than 27 years of a life term for sabotage, told  his visitors he stands ready to be released immediately and has set no  preconditions. But Mandela added that in discussions with De Klerk and other  government officials he has made it clear that his preconditions for  negotiations with the white minority-led government remain the same as those of  the African National Congress, the primary guerrilla group fighting Pretoria.  Among those conditions is a complete lifting of the 3 1/2-year state of  emergency and freedom for all prisoners convicted of politically motivated  crimes.    And, Mandela said that once he is released he will ""never obey any apartheid  laws,"" according to Omar.    It was the largest delegation Mandela has yet received at the sprawling,  three-bedroom home he occupies at the prison, and the visitors included most of  the national leaders of the 2-million-member United Democratic Front  anti-apartheid coalition, which is closely aligned with the ANC.    Another sign of the new era that De Klerk has opened in South Africa came on  state-run television Friday night, when South Africans saw an unedited  rebroadcast of ABC-TV's ""Nightline"" program featuring ANC foreign affairs chief  Thabo Mbeki, South African Foreign Minister Roelof F. (Pik) Botha, and moderate  Zulu leader Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi.    It was the first opportunity for most South Africans, both white and black, to  see and hear a leading ANC official since the organization was banned in 1960.  De Klerk lifted the ban on the ANC and about 60 other anti-apartheid groups  last week and removed ANC leaders' names from the list of people who cannot be  seen or quoted in South Africa.    In the broadcast, which was shown in the United States on Thursday night, Botha  acknowledged that the government should have begun talking with the ANC years  ago. Mbeki said the ANC welcomes De Klerk's new reform initiatives but said the  president has to take more steps before the ANC will call off its campaign to  encourage international sanctions against Pretoria and enter into negotiations.    So far, the ANC has refused to engage in any talks with the government,  although Mandela has been acting as a facilitator between the two parties by  setting out the ANC's stand in meetings with government officials.    Meanwhile, De Klerk defended his reforms to Parliament on Friday, saying he is  trying to create a climate in which black leaders will come to the table to  discuss power-sharing in a new constitution.    He accused his right-wing opponents of trying to stir up racial animosity in  the country. The pro-apartheid Conservative Party has criticized De Klerk,  saying he is giving in to the 27 million black majority, and it has threatened  boycotts and protest strikes to force him to call a new election before his  5-year term expires.    De Klerk said his ruling National Party ""talks renewal and courage, and they  (the Conservatives) talk racism and aggression.""    The Conservatives, who won 31% of the vote in last September's elections, ""will  plunge this country into a racial war,"" De Klerk told Parliament. But, he  added, the government ""will not allow anyone or any party to set fire to this  country.""    De Klerk has said he wants to bring blacks into the national government within  five years, but he opposes a one-man, one-vote system, which is the basic  demand of all leading anti-apartheid groups.    The United Democratic Front on Friday gave Mandela a new policy document that  conditionally supports negotiations with the government. But the UDF document  also calls for multiracial elections for a constituent assembly to draw up a  new constitution, an idea that De Klerk has rejected.    The president's reform moves have been hampered in recent days as police have  used force to disperse several peaceful protests. De Klerk has said he will  permit peaceful protest if permission is obtained from the authorities.    Anti-apartheid groups have welcomed his initiatives, including the lifting of  restrictions on several hundred political activists and a partial rescinding of  the state of emergency. But they are demanding more.    During Friday's rally in Johannesburg, the Rev. Godfrey Henhood told about  1,000 people packed into St. Mary's that ""a major breakthrough has been  achieved.

Mr Mandela arrived at the club and greeted staff before  telling his predominantly white audience his welcome at the club  was a sign of the times -- especially in light of the  relationship between the petrol from oil giant and the ANC's  armed wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation] (which has  attacked its installations in the past).    Asked to comment on this week's National Party federal  congress, the ANC leader said: ""What is there to say about a  party on its way out? The National Party is still a racist  party."" He requested business people to trust the ANC as its  policy mirrored the basic aspirations of all South Africans.    He added the ANC was not out to run a campaign of revenge  against the people who had jailed party leaders, but rather  wanted all South Africans to work together. The country's  economy had become stangnant due to years of apartheid and it  was up to the ANC and the people of South Africa to stimulate  growth.    ""We would like all of you, especially white businessmen, to  help achieve this. We all have a common loyalty to South Africa  and we all want to live in peace.""    Turning to the spate of sabotage attacks on the offices and  homes of ANC aligned people and organisations in the [Orange]  Free State, Mr Mandela told his audience: ""They (ANC homes and  offices) are being bombed by people who are demanding to cling  to apartheid...It is our people being killed by the right  wing...By security organisations and by other black groups...But  the whites in this country are totally silent. When there is  violence it is sparked off by the right wing and is tolerated by  the De Klerk government. Without peace we are not going to get  investment from abroad.""    Mr Mandela added money was being taken out of the country  because of the violence. If a right wing inspired civil war  broke out, it was not only blacks who would be killed. Whites  were destroying the future of their children by not acting  stongly enough on the violence sweeping the country.     "

The  delegation, led by the head of state, General Sani Abacha,  included two former heads of state. They are: General Yakubu  Gowon and Alhaji Shehu Shagari. Gen. Abacha held private talks  with Dr. Mandela and some other African leaders. He told Dr.  Mandela that Nigeria would cooperate with his administration in  ensuring that South Africa assumed its rightful position on the  continent. The head of state said that Nigeria looked forward  to fruitful economic, social, and diplomatic relations with  South Africa. Dr. Mandela expressed delight over the existing  relations between Gen. Abacha and Nigeria's former leaders,  stressing that such understanding will enhance nation-building.    Also yesterday, the head of state, Gen. Sani Abacha, held  talks in Pretoria with some eminent world leaders on the latest  political developments in the country. They include the vice  president of the United States, Mr. Al Gore; the British foreign  secretary, Mr. Douglas Hurd; and [word indistinct] African heads  of state and government. Gen. Abacha used the opportunity to  brief the leaders on the political and social programs initiated  by his administration, as well as the progress so far towards  the commencement of the Constitutional Conference. The British  foreign secretary, Mr. Douglas Hurd, who was at the head of his  country's delegation, told Gen. Abacha that Britain was  following with interest the efforts of the present government  and its leader to (?institute) a stable democratic process.

0,FT942-10559 ,"FT942-10559 _AN-EEJC9AEAFT 940510   FT  10 MAY 94 / Mandela ends journey from prison to power      By MICHAEL HOLMAN and PATTI WALDMEIR      CAPE TOWN   Mr Nelson Mandela yesterday completed his journey from prison to the presidency when South Africa's newly elected parliament chose him as the country's first black head of state. The characteristic sounds and symbols of Africa echoed through the legislative chamber. Women ululated with joy from the African National Congress benches and a traditional Thembu praise singer, clad in skins and beads, chanted the new president's honour. Erstwhile rivals embraced and apartheid's former defenders saluted their new chief. Men and women convicted of treason swore an oath of loyalty to the new state. Mr Mandela stood hand on heart as a military band played 'Die Stem' (The Voice), anthem of apartheid South Africa. A white policeman saluted as the same band played the liberation hymn, 'Nkosi sikele i'Afrika' (God bless Africa). Both are now official anthems. Mr Ronnie Kasrils, newly elected ANC member of parliament once known as the scarlet pimpernel for his efforts to elude the law, spoke for many when he said of the spectacle: 'I have to keep pinching myself.' Shares on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange rose 2.5 per cent as political euphoria dominated market sentiment. For the day at least, old enmities were set aside. Mr Mandela appeared delighted to spot Inkatha leader Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi in the chamber, and crossed the floor to embrace him. He also went out of his way to greet General Constand Viljoen, leader of the rightwing Freedom Front, and Pan Africanist Congress leader Mr Clarence Makwethu. The government of national unity neared completion with the announcement of six ministers from the outgoing National party government. Mr Pik Botha, former foreign minister, becomes minister of mineral and energy affairs, Mr Roelf Meyer, chief constitutional negotiator, was named minister of provincial affairs and constitutional development, and Dawie de Villiers, Cape NP leader, was appointed minister of environment. Mr Mandela made his first public address as president from the spot where in February 1990 he spoke after his release from 27 years in jail. He told thousands outside Cape Town city hall: 'Today we are entering a new era. Today we celebrate not the victory of a party but a victory for all the people of South Africa. 'We place our vision of a new constitutional order on the table not as conquerors, prescribing to the conquered. We speak as fellow citizens to heal the wounds of the past with the intent of constructing a new order based on justice for all."" Mr Mandela pledged a social order 'which respects completely the culture, language and religious rights of all sections of our society and the fundamental rights of the individual'.

""It is our concern to restore economic  stability in the country,"" he said in a 15 minute speech. ""We  have called on our people to end mass action.""    Mr Mandela said the ANC's Reconstruction and Development  Programme [RDP] would seek to meet the needs of the people, who  were forced in the past to resort to mass action to ensure their  demands were attended to. He said the RDP was a massive  programme but would go a long way towards securing stability.  Business had a vital role to play in this programme and  building the country's future strength economically. The  government would create a legislative environment based on free  enterprise so commerce could thrive. ""The JSE has an important  role to play in the reconstruction and development of our  country. We say the economy of the country must be built on  sound market principles. If you look at our programme there's  not a single sentence about nationalisation,"" he told the 300  brokers on the JSE floor.    Mr Mandela's speech was greeted by muted applause from the  traders, despite his assurance the market was vital to raising  new and substantial capital. However, on his way to the  executive offices of the JSE to meet with JSE President Roy  Andersen, the ANC leader was cheered by brokerage messengers and  other staff.     "

By SCOTT KRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER      SOWETO, South Africa      When Walter Sisulu was running the African National Congress offices almost  single-handedly 40 years ago, young black students would often drift by to  chat. And he always seemed to have time for them.    ""You wouldn't go to Nelson Mandela to just talk. He suffered fools very badly,""  remembers Dr. Nthato Motlana, one of those students and an early member of the  ANC. ""But you could always go to Sisulu and talk about the little things. He  was a real uncle.""    In those days, Sisulu was the ANC. He had encouraged a young Mandela, then  newly arrived in Johannesburg, to join the organization. He helped Mandela  enroll in law school, even paying his tuition, and welcomed him into his  mother's home as a lodger.    Sisulu, 77, freed on Sunday after spending the last 26 years in prison, was the  most effective grass-roots organizer of the ANC and, with Mandela and Oliver  Tambo, guided that organization away from its historic reliance on petitioning  the white government for black rights into an era of civil disobedience and  armed struggle.    ""He's a lovely man, jovial and easygoing,"" said Amina Cachalia, who fondly  remembers Sisulu's many visits to her home and that of her husband, Yusuf. ""I  never heard Walter raise his voice or get cross. He was always calm and  level-headed. And always persuasive.""    One of his closest friends in those days was Mandela, who had risen to the  forefront of the anti-apartheid fight by the early 1960s, and that bond grew  stronger during their years together, friends say.    Many former prisoners remember receiving visits from Mandela and Sisulu, and  the two trained several generations of ANC leaders at Robben Island and  Pollsmoor prisons in Cape Town. While Mandela was clearly the leader, Sisulu  was regarded as the thinker and philosophizer of the cause.    But the two men came from sharply different backgrounds. While Mandela was the  son of a tribal chief, Sisulu was the son of a black maid. His father, a white  construction worker, had left the family when Sisulu was young. At the age of  15, he was called on to support his mother and brother.    Although he would have been classified Colored (mixed-race) under South  Africa's race classification laws, he chose to be considered a black and was  initiated into the Xhosa tribe.    He worked in the gold mines, as a domestic worker -- and was fired from a job  in a bakery for organizing a strike to press for higher wages. In his spare  time, he took high school correspondence courses. He set up a small real estate  agency in 1940, and joined the ANC. A year later he met Mandela.    Sisulu had his first run-in with police in the 1940s, when he was imprisoned  for assaulting a white train conductor who had confiscated a black child's  season ticket.    He, Mandela and Tambo, now leader of the ANC in exile, formed the ANC Youth  League, which eventually took control of the ANC and made Sisulu the secretary  general from 1949 to 1954.    Although an early proponent of racial exclusiveness, he became one of the  leading forces in bridging the gap between the ANC and anti-apartheid activists  of other races. Sisulu and Cachalia, then a leading figure in the Transvaal  Indian Congress, organized the Defiance Campaign of 1952. Sisulu kicked it off  by leading activists into a Johannesburg suburb without a permit. Within  months, 8,500 people had been arrested for taking part in the campaign.    Sisulu left the country secretly in 1953 to seek support for the ANC. Upon his  return, he was banned by the government, but he continued working for the rebel  underground. After the government banned the ANC in 1960, Sisulu was detained,  released and placed under house arrest numerous times.    In 1963, he was convicted of furthering the aims of the ANC and placed under  24-hour house arrest while awaiting his appeal. But he escaped and joined the  high command of the ANC's military wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe, or Spear of the  Nation.    Sisulu and other ANC leaders were arrested in a 1963 police raid on a farm in a  Johannesburg suburb. Along with Mandela and eight others, he was convicted of  plotting sabotage and sentenced to life in prison. Since then, Mandela and  Sisulu have been considered the most important leaders in the ANC.    The Sisulus are one of the most prominent anti-apartheid families in South  African history. Walter's wife, Albertina, 71, a nurse, has been repeatedly  arrested, detained and banned during their 35 years of marriage. They have  seven children, two of them adopted, and 20 grandchildren.    The Sisulus' 38-year-old son, Zwelakhe, editor of the New Nation newspaper,  emerged from two years' detention last year and has been placed under severe  restrictions that prevent him from, among other things, leaving home at night  or writing articles for publication.    While in prison, Sisulu was a man without pretense. Small and thin, with heavy  black-rimmed glasses, he cared little about his dress, wearing his prison-issue  sweater until fellow inmates changed it for him, former prisoner Thami  Mkhwanazi wrote recently in the Weekly Mail.    Sisulu loves classical and choral music as well as films and board games. He is  an avid Scrabble player, and prisoners came to his cell after lunch each day to  play and watch the game.    One of his most prized possessions was his dictionary, which he regularly  loaned to the players. ""Half the pages were loose, and he would rearrange the  pages after the game at the end of the day,"" Mkhwanazi remembers.    Mkhwanazi says Sisulu is a walking encyclopedia of the ANC, and like many of  its leaders, Sisulu would occasionally compile political essays or teach  inmates the history and political ideology of the black liberation struggle.  Sisulu also is studying for a bachelor's degree in anthropology.    It was only in recent years that Sisulu and Mandela were allowed regular  visitors. Nevertheless, most of Sisulu's friends outside prison were denied  permission to see him. Until Sunday, the closest contact they had were the  messages Sisulu passed to them through his wife -- and an artist's rendering of  a younger Sisulu that hangs prominently in the living room of his home.      BACKGROUND    The African National Congress, the oldest surviving black political  organization in South Africa, was founded in 1912 as the South African Native  National Congress. The group took its current name in 1923. Initially a  moderate, even conservative organization, it opted for armed struggle against  the South African government after it was banned in 1960. Its president, Oliver  Tambo, heads an external wing operating from Zambia, while its president for  life, Nelson R. Mandela, remains imprisoned for life after being convicted of  sabotage.

In 1963, he was convicted of furthering the aims of the ANC and placed under  24-hour house arrest while awaiting his appeal. But he escaped and joined the  high command of the ANC's military wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe, or Spear of the  Nation.    Sisulu and other ANC leaders were arrested in a 1963 police raid on a farm in a  Johannesburg suburb. Along with Mandela and eight others, he was convicted of  plotting sabotage and sentenced to life in prison. Since then, Mandela and  Sisulu have been considered the most important leaders in the ANC.    The Sisulus are one of the most prominent anti-apartheid families in South  African history. Walter's wife, Albertina, 71, a nurse, has been repeatedly  arrested, detained and banned during their 35 years of marriage. They have  seven children, two of them adopted, and 20 grandchildren.    The Sisulus' 38-year-old son, Zwelakhe, editor of the New Nation newspaper,  emerged from two years' detention last year and has been placed under severe  restrictions that prevent him from, among other things, leaving home at night  or writing articles for publication.    While in prison, Sisulu was a man without pretense. Small and thin, with heavy  black-rimmed glasses, he cared little about his dress, wearing his prison-issue  sweater until fellow inmates changed it for him, former prisoner Thami  Mkhwanazi wrote recently in the Weekly Mail.    Sisulu loves classical and choral music as well as films and board games. He is  an avid Scrabble player, and prisoners came to his cell after lunch each day to  play and watch the game.    One of his most prized possessions was his dictionary, which he regularly  loaned to the players. ""Half the pages were loose, and he would rearrange the  pages after the game at the end of the day,"" Mkhwanazi remembers.    Mkhwanazi says Sisulu is a walking encyclopedia of the ANC, and like many of  its leaders, Sisulu would occasionally compile political essays or teach  inmates the history and political ideology of the black liberation struggle.  Sisulu also is studying for a bachelor's degree in anthropology.    It was only in recent years that Sisulu and Mandela were allowed regular  visitors. Nevertheless, most of Sisulu's friends outside prison were denied  permission to see him. Until Sunday, the closest contact they had were the  messages Sisulu passed to them through his wife -- and an artist's rendering of  a younger Sisulu that hangs prominently in the living room of his home.      BACKGROUND    The African National Congress, the oldest surviving black political  organization in South Africa, was founded in 1912 as the South African Native  National Congress. The group took its current name in 1923. Initially a  moderate, even conservative organization, it opted for armed struggle against  the South African government after it was banned in 1960. Its president, Oliver  Tambo, heads an external wing operating from Zambia, while its president for  life, Nelson R. Mandela, remains imprisoned for life after being convicted of  sabotage.

They sent it to the Organisation of African Unity, the  United  Nations Security Council and its secretary general, Butrus  Butrus-Ghali.    But in acknowledging the crimes being predominantly  committed  by Rwandan government soldiers and ruling party militiamen,  Mandela fails to acknowledge South Africa's role in arming them.  At least 3,000 of Rwanda's soldiers and some militiamen carry  South African R4 automatic rifles. Rwanda bought them in 1992,  along with 10,000 hand-grenades, 20,000 rifle grenades, 10,000  launching grenades, and more than one million rounds of  ammunition.    Rwanda's purchase of arms from South Africa was in violation  of a 1984 voluntary UN Security Council resolution. By 1977 it  had already imposed a binding resolution against any arms sales  to South Africa.    But the UN is expected to lift its arms embargo against  South  Africa soon. This would give Mandela the chance to demonstrate  that the new South Africa would not sell arms to countries like  Rwanda. Instead, Armscor [Armaments Corporation of South Africa]  executive Andre Buys told Defense News: ""We expect that by  1996 exports will at least    When Vaclav Havel became president of Czechoslovakia in  1989,  he promised to end armed exports. But last year, after the  country split into the Czech Republic and Slovakia, both renewed  exports. Unfortunately, Mandela and the African National  Congress seem likely to take the same road.    ""Once the new government is up and running, we will welcome  a  complete lifting of all remaining sanctions and embargoes  against South Africa,"" ANC spokesman Madala Mthembu told DEFENSE  NEWS. ""We also wish to state the new government will be in full  compliance with international standards governing exports of  technologies and materials that would threaten world security.""    Such standards would preclude arms sales, for example, to  states like Libya, which is also currently subject to a UN  embargo. But states like Rwanda before its present crisis would  still be able legally to buy arms.    No one expects Mandela to turn his back on what promises to  become one of the new South Africa's best earners of foreign  exchange. But few would expect, either, a man who has devoted  his life to his country's struggle for justice, equality and  human rights to turn his back on future victims of other abusive  regimes now.    He wouldn't necessarily need to. Because of the existing US  embargo, precise figures on South Africa's military exports are  unknown. But Denel, the state-owned manufacturing consortium  created out of part of Armscor and its subsidiaries in 1992, has  assets of $2.9-billion and has made about $175-million in arms  exports annually so far. Denel accounts for only about 60  percent of the country's total defence sales.    However lethal to its own citizens, Rwanda's purchase of  $5.9- million worth of grenades, mortars and ammunition from  Armscor made only a tiny addition to South Africa's balance  sheet. A leader in almost every weapons grouping, it expects to  make most of its profit from the sale of expensive, hi-tech  systems like laser-designated missiles, aircraft electronic  warfare systems, tactical radios, anti-radiation bombs and  battlefield mobility systems.    South Africa also has a technological edge in landmine  detection and sweeping equipment that countries like Cambodia,  especially, need. While South Africa has already begun to  market this equipment, it announced in March that it would not  sell landmines at the same time, and stopped exports.    Although motivated by appearance before principle, this is a  welcome sign.    But the ANC's present policy isn't good enough. While  exporting mine-sweeping equipment and hi-tech weapons to earn  foreign exchange rightfully, the new South Africa should  re-examine its small-arms export policy. International  prohibitions against arms sales to abusive regimes are at  present non-existent or low.    Rwanda, long documented for its grisly record, is a case in  point. Rather than sink to this standard, Mandela should lead  the world in raising it up.     "

Mr Mandela declined to give details of his proposal for military action, which he discussed yesterday afternoon with President F W de Klerk. Mr Mandela said political measures should be taken but added 'they must be co-ordinated with measures as far as the military situation is concerned.' It appeared last night that the two men had failed to agree on the details of such action. Mr de Klerk said after the meeting that 'contingency plans' had been prepared to increase the security force deployment in Natal. But he said he wanted to meet Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, the chief minister of KwaZulu black homeland and leader of the Inkatha Freedom Party, as soon as possible to seek a political solution to the crisis. 'The government is prepared, willing and able to ensure that law and order will be effectively maintained. Natal is a very difficult province to police . . . We will be here in greater numbers in the days and weeks to come to deal with the volatile and explosive situation here,' Mr de Klerk said. Military intervention in Natal could dramatically escalate violence in the region, where several thousand KwaZulu civil servants, yesterday marched in protest at the threat of military action. Some 6,000 civil servants marched through the KwaZulu capital Ulundi to demonstrate support for Chief Buthelezi. They were responding to statements from ANC leaders on Wednesday calling on the multiparty Transitional Executive Council to take over the administration of KwaZulu. Mr de Klerk said last night that the TEC did not have the power to remove Chief Buthelezi. The ANC will today hold an anti-Buthelezi civil servants' protest in the Natal town of Empangeni and a large march through Durban. Meanwhile, ANC leader Nelson Mandela invited Zulu King Goodwill Zwelethini to meet him at the home of a prominent Natal businessman to discuss the future of KwaZulu. He said the ANC was committed to the idea that 'his majesty takes his legitimate place in the new South Africa as the rightful monarch of the Zulu people.' However, Mr Mandela laid down a condition for the meeting - that it be private - which may be rejected by the king. The two men were to have met last week in Ulundi, but Mr Mandela cancelled the meeting after Chief Buthelezi invited thousands of the king's supporters to attend. ANC officials said they feared for Mr Mandela's safety at the meeting.   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.   Industries:-  P9229 Public Order and Safety, NEC.   Types:-  NEWS  General News.

Answering questions from his audience  at an ANC rally in Rustenburg on Sunday morning, Mr Mandela said  the TEC knew ANC supporters in the homeland were being harassed  and intimidated.    He said the TEC was addressing this problem and would take  appropriate action, saying he realised Bophuthatswana President  Lucas Mangope was persecuting the ANC. But he assured the crowd  President Mangope would be powerless after the April 27  elections.    ""He is fighting a losing battle. The TEC is now the  authoritative power in Bophuthatswana, and we are not without  teeth,"" Mandela said.    The crowd when ecstatic when they thought the ANC leader  said  President Mangope did not have long to ""live"". Realising he had  been misheard, Mr Mandela quickly clarified he had meant  President Mangope did not have long to ""lead"" as president of  the homeland.    Answering Bophuthatswana residents' fears of being harassed  if found with a South African identity document, he pointed out  voters could use their Bop [Bophuthatswana] ID documents.    Amplifying his leader, Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the  Nation  (MK); ANC military wing] chief Joe Modise said Bophuthatswana  was completely dependent on the South Africa for its survival.  However, if the situation did not improve, Mr Modise said they  might have to move troops into the homeland the elections to  allow political freedom.    Taking a dig at the National Party's campaigning tactics Mr  Mandela said it would cost tax payers nearly R[Rand]500,000 if  the NP had to pay people R10 each ""for food and transport"" to  get a crowd. ""If the national party offers you stew, potatoes  and an orange to go to the rally, I say go. And then vote for  the ANC,"" he said, smiling broadly.    He said the NP's electioneering tricks created hostility.  Reacting to accusations from the NP that campaigners were being  harassed by ANC supporters in the townships, Mr Mandela said ANC  offices in five rightwing towns and the homes of two ANC  officials had been bombed recently. The NP had not complained or  taken any action to prevent more attacks, he said.    It was in the interest of all ANC supporters to allow the NP  to campaign freely in the townships. ""I appeal to you all. I  don't want that party to say they lost the elections because  they were not allowed to put their views across to everyone.""    His American style of campaigning to meet the people and  mingle with supporters nearly came to grief on Sunday. As crowds  surged forward to shake Mr Mandela's hand at his car, a trapped  reporter nearly had her legs crushed when the bodyguards in the  car behind surged forward to close the gap.    She was forced to leap onto the bonnet of the car and spend  a  terrifying few moments while the bodyguards sped forward to try  and get her off the car. Only cries from the crowd persuaded  them to stop and allow her to be carried away.    A peace monitor was overheard commenting: ""There is no  proper  control here today. The marshals are ineffective and this  incident is a warning that someone could get seriously hurt soon  if security measures are not beefed up"".    A minute's silence was observed at the rally for former  Cosatu [Congress of South African Trade Unions] president and  mineworker, Elijah Barayi, who was buried in Carletonville on  Sunday.     "

Britain said it is time to resume contacts with internationally isolated South  Africa, but anti-apartheid campaigners warned against any reduction of pressure  on the white-led government.

Keith Kendall asked Marques Rodriques, councillor at  the Cuban Foreign Ministry and presently in Pretoria, why the  announcement was so late.    [Begin recording] [Rodriques] Well, I mean that depends on  the schedule of President Castro. You know that Cuba is a very  far country and the president of course has a lot of engagements  to attend, and that's why it's a normal procedure.    [Kendall] This was not for security reasons?    [Rodriques] Well, it's part of the procedures for the  president. (?They) take into consideration the distance between  Cuba and South Africa, and the engagements of the president.    [Kendall] How important for Cuba are ties with the new South  Africa?    [Rodriques] I think this is very important for Cuba. There  have been long historical relations between Cuba and the  patriotic forces, and the ANC in South Africa. That's why this  victory of the democratic forces in South Africa is of a great  importance for Cuba. We feel very satisfied, we feel a great joy  towards President Mandela and his post.    [Kendall] Are you hoping for close ties with South Africa  following the inauguration of President Mandela?    [Rodriques] Definitely. I mean, it's the express will of our  government to keep very close ties with the new Government of  South Africa, and these ties will go from the political field,  and we are hoping also that we can have very strong ties, from  the technical point of view, from the commercial point of view,  and many other fields. We feel very optimistic that this kind  of relations will become greater. [passage omitted] [end  recording]     "

Michael A. Peri's fantasies of espionage were fueled by a magazine  article he read about the Marine spy scandal in Moscow, leading him to give  military secrets to the East Germans, prosecutors suggested to a court-marital  jury in West Germany on Thursday.    Peri seemed fascinated by a Time magazine story he read on Feb. 17, friends  told military investigators, and bragged that his security clearance allowed  him access to top secret information of the type obtained by the Soviet agents.    ""The friends thought the death penalty would be warranted (for the Marine  guards who allowed Soviets to view U.S. Embassy documents), and Peri thought  prison was enough,"" Maj. Michael D. Graham, the Army prosecutor, told jurors.    Defense lawyers, however, described Peri as ""a very immature young man . . .  who acted out of despair, curiosity and fear.""    The Orange County soldier was isolated and childish, but no spy, defense  attorney Michael Christensen said during the first day of Peri's sentencing  hearing Thursday. Peri, 22, pleaded guilty to espionage charges Wednesday.    ""The U.S. didn't bring Michael to justice,"" Christensen told jurors, according  to a report by Stars and Stripes, the U.S. military's newspaper for its  personnel in Europe. ""He did it on his own. He brought himself back to face the  consequences of his immature, childlike actions. This is not a spy case.""    Peri, who testified Wednesday that his trip to East Germany on Feb. 20 was  prompted by frustration with his military intelligence job, faces a maximum  punishment of life in prison. He sat impassively through sentencing arguments  Thursday at the Army Community Center in Fulda, West Germany. His parents, Fred  and Winnie Peri of Laguna Niguel, attended the first day of court-martial  proceedings Wednesday, but left Thursday's hearing after selection of the jury.    Graham said that three days after Peri read the spy article, he crossed into  East Germany with a stolen laptop computer and four floppy discs that contained  secret information on how the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment, the Army's  front-line unit for defense of West Germany, would respond to a Soviet attack.  An analysis showed the information had been copied by the East German  officials, he said.    The military prosecutor read aloud a 17-page report that had been prepared by  military investigators and signed by Peri. The report revealed new details  about Peri's trip to East Germany and eventual surrender.    According to the document, Peri read the Time article during a four-day weekend  in the nearby city of Wildfeld, where he and a roommate visited a Peri family  friend. After returning on the 20th, Peri was seen at a Fulda bank where he  withdrew $120 from a savings account, leaving only $3.      Skipped Special Dessert    Peri then went out to dinner with two friends, but instead of meeting them at a  second restaurant, where Peri had suggested they all go for a special dessert,  he returned to his barracks in the 11th Armored Cavalry headquarters in Fulda,  the report states. Peri packed a sport bag with clothing and then breached  security by going unaccompanied into the double-locked vault of the military  intelligence unit and taking the computer and discs.    Witnesses told investigators they spotted Peri at several locations on the  military post that night, and one soldier reported that he saw Peri in a  laundry room, with his face wet as though he had been crying. Flares spotted by  West German customs officials at 11:15 that night are believed to have marked  Peri's discovery by East German soldiers, the document stated. Peri had checked  out a military vehicle and drove to a spot about a mile from the East German  border.    The report revealed little about Peri's whereabouts or activities in East  Germany, information that Peri gave to Army intelligence experts during  interviews June 6 to 9 on the condition that it not be used to prosecute him.  However, the report stated that while in East Berlin on March 1, Peri signed  two declarations, stating that he did not wish to contact U.S. authorities and  that he wanted to go to Austria, where he had attended high school when his  family lived in Europe in the early 1980s.    East German officials notified U.S. diplomats that Peri had been released to  the country of his choice on March 3. Later that day, Peri left the East German  capital and traveled by train to Salzburg, Austria, where, he told authorities,  he stayed in a 5-star hotel. He said he made no attempt to contact his parents  or U.S. officials while in Salzburg, and returned by train to Fulda the next  day.      Carried $200 on Return    Peri, who was missing for 12 days, walked through the gates of the post at  Fulda and surrendered to military police on March 4. When he was searched, Peri  carried the equivalent of about $200 in U.S. and West German currency. It was  not revealed where he obtained the additional money.    Although Peri's attorney, a civilian who is military legal officer for the Utah  National Guard, insisted that Peri ""did not divulge any important secrets"" to  East German officials, prosecutors said they will call intelligence experts to  testify on the damage caused by his disclosures.    In addition, testimony by Peri's supervising officer disputed Christensen's  claim that the soldier functions at the level of ""a 9- to 11-year-old.""    Capt. Timothy J. Quinn told jurors that he considered Peri ""a good,  above-average soldier; a smart and trusted kid."" Quinn said Peri had access to  ""higher than top secret documents"" and added that additional security  precautions are now taken in the intelligence unit because of the thefts by  Peri.    Another Army official testified Thursday that an intensive, three-day search  for Peri, begun on Feb. 23 when a military vehicle Peri signed out was found in  a shallow ditch just a mile from the East German border, cost $1 million to  $1.2 million in salaries, vehicles and aircraft hours.    The sentencing hearing is expected to continue through Saturday.

The ordinary reader  of these paragraphs would justifiably infer from what he said in  them that anybody opposing the constitution and the election  under it are `steeped in the politics of the past -- the  politics of racism, ethnic chauvinism and violence'.    I oppose the 1993 constitution because it is fatally flawed  as a democratic constitution and any election under it must be  rejected as undemocratic. We reject the constitution on  universally accepted constitutional principles.    No constitution which dictates that it be replaced by  another  constitution drawn up and piloted through a new constitution  making process by a ruling political party, would be accepted by  any democratic people in the world. Constitutions should be all  about limiting the power of the state and maximising the power  of the people. Dogs do not muzzle themselves and ruling parties  do not write constitutions which are designed to ensure frequent  changes of government through the electoral process.    Every democratic constitution relies on special majorities  before constitutions can be amended. Instead of this  universally accepted norm the 1993 constitution has in it  deadlock-breaking mechanisms which dictate that the only  constitution that will be put to a panel of experts and before  the electorate in a referendum could, and probably will, be  adopted by a 50.1 per cent majority -- the majority of a ruling  party. These are some of the fatal flaws in the constitution  which have nothing to do with racism.    As far as the rest of the document is concerned I comment as  follows:     -  Until we have a wording of the constitutional principle  which is different to the principle agreed to by the ANC but  rejected by the AVF [Afrikaner National Front] and the Freedom  Alliance, there is no way forward on this issue.    -  Mr Mandela refers to provisions for provincial finances which  were agreed to in negotiations with the Freedom Alliance. No  such agreement exists. Nor has it ever existed. It was one of  the issues on which there were repeated deadlocks.    -  Mr Mandela refers to a constitutional provision which allows  provinces to adopt their own legislative and executive  structures, but fails to tell the world that the new  constitutional text adopted by a constitutional assembly could  scrap the best that a region could produce in making these  determinations.    -  Mr Mandela says that in order to grant greater security to  newly elected democratic provincial governments, amendments  should be introduced which ensure that they will not suffer a  lessening of the powers granted to them under the 1993  constitution.       What earthly use is it to be guaranteed less than the powers  you have, when what is proposed you have is ridiculously  inadequate.    All Mr Mandela is doing is placing before the public  constitutional proposals which led to the deadlock in  negotiations, and introducing them as breakthrough proposals  which the ANC is prepared to make. What utter hypocrisy. Mr  Mandela's statement amounts to no more than cheap politicking on  life and death issues.    Mr Mandela concludes by warning of strong action against  those who 'use force to disrupt' elections and says that action  will be taken against them. I and the IFP [Inkatha Freedom  Party] and the kwaZulu government will oppose the constitution  and the proposed election under it and we will do so with every  available democratic means at our disposal. That is our  democratic right and we will do so.     "
0,FT942-10429 ,"FT942-10429 _AN-EEKC7AAKFT 940511   FT  11 MAY 94 / Mandela takes the reins of power: Ceremony ends 300 years of white rule in South Africa      By PATTI WALDMEIR and MICHAEL HOLMAN      PRETORIA   White South Africans handed over power to blacks, voluntarily and peacefully, yesterday when Mr Nelson Mandela was sworn in as president in a ceremony which formally ended more than three centuries of white rule. The reality of the transfer of power struck home when jets from the most powerful military machine on the continent paid homage to Africa's newest head of state. White South African generals joined black guerrilla leaders to escort their new president to the podium to take the oath of office, signalling an overnight shift in allegiance to the man they once hunted for terrorism. As princes and kings, prime ministers and presidents from more than 140 countries listened, Mr Mandela (pictured above) pledged his own allegiance to the South African state he once sought to overthrow. 'I do hereby swear to be faithful to the republic of South Africa and do solemnly and sincerely promise to promote that which will advance and to oppose all that may harm the republic . . . and to devote myself to the well-being of the republic and all its people.' As blacks struggled to sing Die Stem (The Voice), once the anthem of apartheid, white South Africans haltingly sang the words of Nkosi sikele i'Afrika (God bless Africa), the liberation hymn. Both are now official anthems. Mr Mandela praised the man who opened the chapter which closed with yesterday's ceremony - Mr FW de Klerk, the outgoing president and yesterday installed as Mr Mandela's second deputy president. 'He has made for himself a niche in history. He has turned out to be one of the greatest reformers, one of the greatest sons of our soil,' said Mr Mandela, speaking from a giant bulletproof cage, where he stood flanked by Mr de Klerk and first deputy president Mr Thabo Mbeki. Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, shared the fourth row of the impressive Union Buildings amphitheatre with US vice-president Al Gore, his wife Tipper and Mrs Hillary Clinton. Cuban president Fidel Castro, Palestine Liberation Organisation leader Yassir Arafat, Israeli president Ezer Weizman and United Nations secretary-general Boutros Boutros Ghali were also in the crowd. Zulu king Goodwill Zwelithini was moved to a place directly in front of Mr Mandela when ANC officials realised they had failed to accord the monarch a central seat. After the ceremony, President Mandela treated thousands of guests to lunch before dropping in, by helicopter, to a celebratory soccer match between South Africa and Zambia, home to the ANC in exile. Back at the Union Buildings, even the policemen and soldiers began to relax and join in; military policeman stuck new South African flags in their gun holsters and a soldier read a comic book atop an armoured car.

The minister made a brief statement to the media at the  conclusion of the main event that paid tribute to the Cuban  fighters who died in Africa and hailed the victory of the  African National Congress and its leader.    Raul Castro said Mandela was able to achieve victory because  of his great intelligence, which he demonstrated with his  successful performance in a multinational, multiracial, and  multireligious country that has witnessed great hatred because  of discriminatory practices.    Raul Castro concluded: We only wish him to continue  achieving  victories, as he has to this point, during his journey along the  lengthy and difficult road ahead of him.     "
0,FT942-11064 ,"FT942-11064 _AN-EEHA5AAWFT 940507   FT  07 MAY 94 / South African Elections: Mandela delights whites and investors      By PATTI WALDMEIR   Mr Nelson Mandela does not miss a trick. Despite opposition from within his own African National Congress, he yesterday delighted investors, businessmen and white South Africans by retaining Mr Derek Keys as the finance minister. Nothing else would have persuaded the outside world - not to mention sceptical South Africans - of his commitment to free market economics and political moderation. Again and again, Mr Mandela has stressed the need to restore business confidence and attract foreign investment. Yesterday he took the most concrete step possible toward achieving those goals. In the two years since he was appointed finance minister by outgoing President F W de Klerk, Mr Keys has proved a tough fiscal disciplinarian. He has halted the rise in government spending, and reined in the budget deficit. And best of all, he has amply demonstrated that he is his own man, and no politician's fool. He would not have accepted the post of finance minister in an ANC-led government without assurances from Mr Mandela that economic discipline would be maintained. He realises the importance of leaving the department, the portfolio, of finance as it is - without interference,' said the pragmatic Mr Mandela in Cape Town, flanked by his two new deputy presidents, Mr Thabo Mbeki of the ANC and Mr De Klerk. The other central economic post, governor of the Reserve Bank or central bank, will also be unchanged: monetary disciplinarian Mr Chris Stals will remain as governor when his term ends in July. The moderate tone established with the re-appointment of Mr Keys will be further strengthened by the news that Mr Thabo Mbeki is to be first deputy president, effectively Mr Mandela's prime minister and probably his political heir. Mr Mbeki has long represented the acceptable face of the ANC to the business community, at home and abroad; he has served as unofficial ambassador to white South Africa since the early 1980s, when secret contacts began between the ANC and liberal Afrikaners. Whites know and like him; articulate, well educated, urbane and charming, he soothes their fears. Few other candidates could have put such a conciliatory stamp on the cabinet. Mr Mbeki's chief rival for the post of deputy president, Cyril Ramaphosa, is a brilliant strategist and fearsome political negotiator. He would have been tougher, but perhaps not better. Mr Ramaphosa has opted to remain outside the cabinet, working to strengthen the ANC as party secretary general. This is exactly the post he always said he wanted; but no one believed him, suspecting he had higher political ambitions. Apart from these certainties, some posts remain unfilled. The ANC has said there will be six National Party ministers, but has named only one (Mr Keys); and it has not named the three Inkatha Freedom Party ministers due to be appointed to the government of national unity. Somehow, Inkatha Freedom Party leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi must be accommodated in a post which acknowledges his surprisingly strong electoral showing: 10.5 per cent of the national vote. Easily offended, his pride must be assuaged; this will not be an easy task. There are also some wildcards, and some weaknesses, in the remaining ANC appointments. Mr Jay Naidoo, appointed minister without portfolio, is expected to oversee the ANC's reconstruction and development programme, though it is not clear how much power he will have over finance minister Mr Keys. Mr Mandela has made abundantly clear that he will brook no opposition from anyone on implementing the programme - apparently including Mr Keys. There could yet be conflict, when the programme's goal of black uplift inevitably clashes with the need for fiscal discipline. One notable weakness is foreign minister Alfred Nzo, former ANC secretary general, who was replaced three years ago, partly because of poor performance. He will do little to raise South Africa's international profile. Both police and defence have gone to the ANC, leaving the National Party with no important security portfolio, although Mr Mandela has said he is prepared to amend the cabinet list after consultation with Mr De Klerk.

From the Baltimore Sun      LONDON      African National Congress leader Nelson R.

Speaking from the stage of a sellout concert before 72,000 people at London's  Wembley Stadium to celebrate his freedom, he told television viewers in 60  countries: ""Reject any suggestion that the campaign to isolate the apartheid  system should be wound down.""    But expressing surprising optimism at the pace of reforms, he predicted: ""It  will not be long now before we see an end to the apartheid system.

Calling for the transformation of South Africa from being ""the skunk of the  Earth"" to an ""exemplary oasis"" of democracy, good race relations and freedom  from poverty and human degradation, he said: ""It will be a proud day for  humanity when we are able to say that the apartheid crime against humanity is  no more.""    He reminded his audience that there are still political prisoners in South  African custody, saying: ""We should, therefore, treat this day of celebration  as one of re-dedication to the continuation and intensification of the struggle  for the emancipation of all the remaining political prisoners.""    The program was not televised in the United States, where it was deemed too  political, or in South Africa.    In a thinly veiled attack on British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who  eased sanctions on South Africa earlier this year in response to political  reforms there, Mandela said:    ""It is only those who support apartheid who can argue that the Pretoria  government should be rewarded for the small steps it has taken, such as our  release, and the unbanning of the ANC and the other organizations.""    Thatcher lifted a ban on new British investments, without waiting for the  approval of her partners in the 12-member European Community.    Before arriving here, Mandela called the British policy ""absolutely disastrous""  and spurned an open invitation to meet the prime minister during his two days  in London.    The concert was staged to celebrate Mandela's release in February from 27 years  in prison.    Among the entertainers were Bonnie Raitt, Neil Young, Simple Minds, Soul II  Soul, the Neville Brothers, Peter Gabriel, Anita Baker, Tracy Chapman, Jackson  Browne, Johnny Clegg and actor Denzel Washington.    In his speech, Mandela said: ""The transformation of our country into a  non-racial democracy . . . will only become reality as a result of struggle,  including the struggle represented by the international sanctions campaign. . .  . The apartheid crime against humanity remains in place. It continues to kill  and maim. It continues to oppress and exploit. . . .

He also is the elder brother of South Africa's National  Party leader Frederik W. de Klerk.      JOHANNESBURG      The reaction to the meeting between South African President Pieter W. Botha and  jailed black leader Nelson Mandela can be measured four ways -- suspicion,  reservation, hope and exaggerated expectation.    Some are suspicious of the meeting because they see it as Botha's revenge on  the National Party and its leader, Frederik W. de Klerk, a way to complicate  matters for them with white conservatives in the September national election.  These critics believe that Botha is on an ego trip to regain prestige before  his retirement.    The other suspicion is that the meeting is a political trick to win more  support from the left for Botha's National Party to appease the outside world,  to stop sanctions and to make a meeting possible between President Bush and De  Klerk.    There is also widespread suspicion that it is a trap for Mandela, designed to  estrange him from his support and thus cause discord in the ranks of the  African National Congress. Political agendas are always motivated by some  self-interest. But I am convinced that all of the ulterior motives that I have  summarized do not apply in this case.    The matter is too serious, Mandela is too strong and his position is so  internationalized that the meeting did not take place by happenstance. Botha  planned it with a positive purpose in mind.    The second reaction to the Mandela-Botha meeting is reservation. What was the  precise content of the discussion? Was it purely formal courtesy? Has  continuity been built into the discussion? Has progress really been made, and  did Botha and Mandela interpret each other correctly? What mandate did they  have? And what pressure can be expected from their respective power bases?    At this stage there are no precise answers. By all indications, however, the  answers will be positive.    The third reaction, which is the dominant one, is that this meeting has created  hope that a breakthrough can be achieved in the racial cul-de-sac in South  Africa.    The eventual possibilities are promising: Further discussions with Mandela;  contact with the ANC to discuss his release; inclusion of Mandela in  pre-negotiations directed toward a post-apartheid political system; the lift of  the ban on the ANC and the release of other political detainees; a lift of the  state of emergency, and finally, the assurance that discussions will include  leaders of all interested black factions.    The first step in the process has been taken, but exaggerated expectations are  not appropriate. Expectations that Mandela will be released within weeks are  euphoric and boil down to wishful thinking.    Dramatic movement will depend mainly on two things: The National Party's  purposefulness and the rate at which it moves ahead and stays on its course;  and the ANC's willingness to make compromises and participate in the process of  transitional politics.    I am not surprised that the meeting took place. It was an essential component  of the strategy to bring about negotiation. It was also a component of the new  spirit of reconciliation in southern Africa.    Progress has indeed been made. The meeting will have a moderating impact on the  national elections. The government now can hardly cite the ANC as enemy No. 1.  As a result of this meeting, rightist movements in politics have finally  received the cold shoulder from the government. The election agenda can now  revolve around important and essential issues instead of the siege mentality  once promoted by Botha.

Wrapping up the historic debate on his opening speech to  South Africa's first democratically elected Parliament, Mr  Mandela paid tribute to the central role played by the people  and their many organisations in gaining democracy.    Quoting the Freedom Charter, Mr Mandela traced the struggle  for democracy. ""Today, all the members of the house, no matter  which party you belong to, are here in the full knowledge that  you are the legitimate representative of the will of the  people,"" he said.    The ANC had resisted undemocratic attempts to shackle  majority rule. ""The plan for a government of democratic unity  we put forward -- and which is now operative -- is inclusive and  democratic,"" he said.    The ANC had expanded its primary Cosatu [Congress of South  African Trade Unions]/SACP [South African Communist Party]  alliance to include the patriotic front, with its commitment to  inclusivity for the sake of nation-building finding its latest  expression in the government of national unity. ""Admonitions  directed at our address about the dangers of a majority party  abusing its majority to stifle and swamp smaller parties are,  therefore, grossly misplaced. Our record in this regard should  certainly speak for itself.""    ""We are not expecting uncritical adulation and applause.""    The people's confidence in the future should not however be  undermined by constant insinuations that the ANC was indifferent  to the concerns of political minorities when it had consistently  demonstrated how seriously those concerns were taken. ""Our  objective is to continue operating in this balanced way, true to  the precept of the Freedom Charter that all national groups  shall have equal rights, the overriding obligation of course  being to meet the needs and improve the lives of the suffering  people.""    He was encouraged that this was generally agreed to by all  parties.    He said there had been moving moments in the debate as  speakers responded to the exciting, inspirational and liberating  possibilities and realities of new-found South Africanness.  ""Listening to our Afrikaner compatriots in this house hailing  the dawn of the new democratic South Africa as an event of  liberation for themselves rather than an experience of loss;  hearing the honourable leader of the Freedom Front (General  Constand Viljoen) publicly acknowledging and paying tribute to  the demonstrated desire of the majority party to create an  inclusive nation where there is place for all -- these were some  of the moments which captured the new spirit abroad in our land.""    These responses had demonstrated an encouraging generosity  of  spirit, reciprocating the generosity abundantly displayed by the  oppressed and suffering people who had mandated their leaders to  negotiate a future of peace, forgiveness and inclusivity.

Mr Niehaus said the ANC was especially concerned about  safety  on the election roadshows of ANC President Nelson Mandela.  Reports of Mr Mandela being conveyed from rally to rally at  high speed had also caused concern. He denied that Mr Mandela's  drivers were driving too fast and said journalists were creating  problems by trying to beat Mr Mandela to his destinations.    He said speeds were dictated by traffic authorities seeing  convoys through their areas. Journalists thronging around Mr  Mandela to get off-the-cuff comments also created problems.

0,FT941-3546 ,"FT941-3546 _AN-ECQAKAA1FT 940316   FT  16 MAR 94 / Mandela enters Bophuthatswana in triumph      By PATTI WALDMEIR      MMABATHO   Mr Nelson Mandela, leader of the African National Congress, yesterday made a triumphal entry to the Bophuthatswana capital, Mmabatho, congratulating the people of the black 'homeland' for ousting President Lucas Mangope, and issuing a veiled warning that the same might happen to Zulu Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi. Some 40,000 people cheered wildly as Mr Mandela entered the futuristic 'Independence Stadium' built to commemorate Bophuthatswana's granting of independence from South Africa in 1977, a sovereignty which only Pretoria recognised. He had harsh words for Chief Buthelezi, leader of the KwaZulu black homeland, saying last week's events in Bophuthatswana would 'send a signal' to him and to the white right-wing. 'The people have risen and tyrants have fallen. This message will not be lost on people living under other toy tyrants in this country,' he said, a comment which bordered on a direct invitation to the people of KwaZulu to revolt. His remarks will not improve the political situation in Natal, where at least nine people were killed yesterday in fighting between the ANC and Chief Buthelezi's Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom party. Nor do they improve prospects for the success of talks later this week between Mr Mandela and Zulu King Goodwill Zwelethini, aimed at ensuring Inkatha's participation in the first all-race elections in April. The king has strong links to Inkatha, through Chief Buthelezi, who is chief adviser to the monarchy. Mr Mandela denigrated the threat from Inkatha, saying he would suffer 'no sleepless nights' over its promise to disrupt elections. The right wing, and by implication Inkatha, were 'no more than those who bark without being able to bite,' he said. ANC leaders, who previously expressed grave concern at the right's ability to disrupt elections, have gained confidence since armed right-wing whites were chased out of Bophuthatswana on Friday, after briefly occupying the capital. This new confidence is likely to undermine the ANC's commitment to negotiate a deal to bring Inkatha, the only remaining party boycotting the poll, into a constitutional settlement. Mr Mandela arrived in Mmabatho yesterday morning to a low-key reception in the streets, with very few people turning out to greet his motorcade. Later in the day, the largest crowd ever seen for a public event in Bophuthatswana turned out at the Independence Stadium, but it remained about a third empty. The stadium, visible across many kilometres of the flat Bophuthatswana veld, is widely seen as a symbol of President Mangope's rule: the upper sets of seats are set at angles which form attractive silhouettes against the sky, but make it impossible to see the pitch from anywhere but the central stands. Mr Mandela condemned looting that destroyed Mmabatho's shopping district, but ANC officials made clear to business people an ANC government would not compensate them for what officials implied was a necessary part of the liberation struggle. Still, Indian business people, many of whom lost all their stock, turned out to greet and garland the ANC leader. One Asian businessman said after the meeting: 'The Indian community are jumping on the bandwagon. They used to support Mangope, now they support Mandela.'   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.

0,FT921-10274 ,"FT921-10274 _AN-CBGA3AAUFT 920207   FT  07 FEB 92 / Mandela to reconsider nationalisation      By PATTI WALDMEIR      JOHANNESBURG   MR Nelson Mandela, president of the African National Congress, said yesterday the organisation would reconsider its policy of nationalisation because of opposition from potential investors. 'Nationalisation is our policy,' Mr Mandela told businessmen during a visit to Denmark, 'but there is a shift in our thinking. We have observed the hostility and concern of businessmen towards nationalisation, and we can't ignore their perceptions,' he said. 'If we want to create a climate where investors will not fear losing their investments, their dividends, we have to take a decision on the question of nationalisation.' Mr Mandela for months has insisted that the ANC is not 'wedded' to the idea of nationalisation, but has threatened that the movement would resort to nationalisation unless businessmen came up with an alternative which would improve distribution of income and wealth in South Africa. He repeated this demand only four days ago and is likely to revert to threats of nationalisation if it is not met. The ANC leader's latest moderate line contradicts views of hardline members within the organisation, some of whom are very influential. His speech last weekend to the World Economic Forum in Davos had originally included a section obviously prepared by hardliners, in which he promised nationalisation of key enterprises as 'a major step towards overcoming the huge inequality in the ownership of our country's wealth' and accused South African business of illegally transferring huge sums abroad. Mr Mandela dropped these sections. A further sign of dissent came on Wednesday when the ANC repeated its threat to renege on foreign loans made to the current government, contradicting assurances made by Mr Mandela at Davos. Yesterday he said he had been struck by the concern over the ANC's nationalisation stand expressed by the 2,000 businessmen present at Davos. He had also been told that whereas countries emerging from war had previously been able to nationalise to provide jobs and stimulate economic growth, this was no longer feasible in a world of inter-linked economies.

At the Organisation of African unity summit in  Tunis this week, President Nelson Mandela was embraced by fellow  African leaders as the continent's miracle-maker, forcing his  aides to squash ""exaggerated"" hopes for financial aid and  intervention in conflicts and requests that the president take  sides in international disputes. In developments this week:    -- Mr Mandela resisted pressure to send SANDF [South African  National Defence Force] troops to Rwanda or to mediate between  the representatives of the warring government and rebel forces.  Instead, South Africa donated R1-million [rand] to the OAU peace  fund, and will support church efforts to deliver supplies to  Rwanda.    -- South Africa declined to send troops to Lesotho despite  three separate demands that it do so by the Frontline States,  led by Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe. Mr Mugabe argued for  military intervention at the OAU meeting, at the meeting of the  Frontline States in Harare, and at the World Economic Forum in  Cape Town last week.    -- Hopes that South Africa would mediate in the Angolan  conflict were also squashed when Mr Mandela declined a leading  role in this initiative.    -- South Africa rebuffed approaches to immediately cement  full diplomatic ties with North Korea after the Asian country  sent an urgent mission to the Tunisian capital. North Korea is  teetering towards a military clash with the U.S. over its  nuclear programme and is anxious to have South Africa on its  side.    -- Officials said reparation in cash, requested by the  Frontline States for their assistance in the war against  apartheid, would not be forthcoming. Instead, South Africa  would enter joint projects aimed at developing the region.    -- Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo tried to avoid a motion  backing Libya in its dispute with the U.S. and the United  Kingdom over the Lockerbie bombing being tabled at the OAU  meeting.    A presidential aide said that, apart from wanting to avoid  being drawn into energy-sapping disputes in Africa, the new  government was also aware that, as a ""newcomer"", it had to be  sensitive to other African leaders. The aide added the  government also had to be aware of is own domestic demands  before it committed huge resources to the rest of the continent.    In an interview this week, Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz  Pahad  outlined a pragmatic, interest-driven foreign policy with the  chief priority of securing resources for the country's  Reconstruction and Development Programme.    Addressing a press conference on the issues of Rwanda and  Angola on his return from the OAU, Mr Mandela said: ""It appears  that leaders of countries where there is conflict would like to  exploit the experience we have had, but I feel we will achieve  better results if we fit in with the strategies already started,  instead of starting our own independent initiatives.""    He said he was willing to consider a possible meeting with  the warring Rwandan parties -- but to listen, rather than to  mediate. There were three other ""perfectly competent"" African  leaders who were already involved in mediating the conflict, he  added.    On the Angolan issue, Mr Mandela said that, while he had  been  asked to meet President Eduardo dos Santos and Mobuto Sese Seko,  he would prefer to support an initiative started by Mozambique  President Joaquim Chissano.    After the joy at admitting South Africa as the 53rd member  of  the OAU subsided, disappointment surfaced that Mr Mandela had  not done more to bolster the finances of the OAU or the  economies of its members. However, Mr Mandela made it clear  that South Africa would not hand out material resources except  to help raise living standards.    On several occasions he was forced to remind journalists and  delegates that he was not the Messiah and that no individual  would solve Africa's economic and social problems.    Foreign Affairs director-general Rusty Evans said in an  interview in Tunis: ""Of course they (African countries) have  expectations...of course, in their misery, they look at South  Africa as something that might suddenly bring relief of sorts.    ""At the same time there is a sense of realism. The South  African delegation has been warning against expecting too much.""    OAU Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim said people were  being unfair to South Africa in questioning what it would to  strengthen the African economy. ""The best contribution South  Africa can give is to become stable and strong and it will then  gradually impact on the continent,"" he said.    However, leading Africa analyst John Coker was critical. He  said South Africa's R1-million contribution to the OAU peace  fund was insignificant, in dollar terms, compared to the amount  of funds the OAU and its members had spent aiding the struggle  against apartheid.

The talks underscored the progress De Klerk has made in eight months as  president toward easing South Africa's isolation and convincing Western leaders  that he is serious about ending apartheid.    Paris is the first stop for De Klerk on an 18-day European tour to seek support  for his reform initiatives and a lifting of economic sanctions. It is the most  extensive foreign mission by a South African head of state since the National  Party took power in 1948.    Mitterrand and other Western leaders agreed to receive De Klerk after he  ordered the release of Nelson Mandela in February and lifted a 30-year ban on  the African National Congress.    Mandela, the ANC deputy president, is expected to meet Mitterrand on June 7  when he visits France as part of his own European tour, Hubert Vedrine, the  Elysee Palace presidential spokesman announced Thursday.    Mandela and De Klerk agreed during talks last week to work together to end  political violence and clear the way for formal negotiations on a  post-apartheid constitution that would extend voting rights to the black  majority.    De Klerk is scheduled to leave Paris on Friday for Greece, with later stops  planned in Portugal, Belgium, Britain, West Germany, Switzerland, Spain and  Italy.

The talks underscored the progress De Klerk has made in eight months as  president toward easing South Africa's isolation and convincing Western leaders  that he is serious about ending apartheid.    Paris is the first stop for De Klerk on an 18-day European tour to seek support  for his reform initiatives and a lifting of economic sanctions. It is the most  extensive foreign mission by a South African head of state since the National  Party took power in 1948.    Mitterrand and other Western leaders agreed to receive De Klerk after he  ordered the release of Nelson Mandela in February and lifted a 30-year ban on  the African National Congress.    Mandela, the ANC deputy president, is expected to meet Mitterrand on June 7  when he visits France as part of his own European tour, Hubert Vedrine, the  Elysee Palace presidential spokesman announced Thursday.    Mandela and De Klerk agreed during talks last week to work together to end  political violence and clear the way for formal negotiations on a  post-apartheid constitution that would extend voting rights to the black  majority.    De Klerk is scheduled to leave Paris on Friday for Greece, with later stops  planned in Portugal, Belgium, Britain, West Germany, Switzerland, Spain and  Italy.

0,FT942-13663 ,"FT942-13663 _AN-EDXAFADFFT 940423   FT  23 APR 94 / Mandela woos old financial enemies: Johannesburg brokers applaud ANC president      By MARK SUZMAN   The faces of the affluent white males in the glass-enclosed trading floor of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange yesterday looked as relieved as if the Springbok rugby team had just scored a try. Bemused expressions became smiles as they broke into applause when Mr Nelson Mandela, president of the African National Congress, ended his maiden speech to the exchange. Mr Mandela at times struggled to make himself heard over the chants of 'Amandla' (power) coming from the black office workers and cleaners who had gathered in the large atrium outside to celebrate the presence of their leader. When he had finished, one broker voiced the feelings of most of the gathered businessmen. 'He was quite impressive, wasn't he?' The financial community might have been forgiven for fearing the worst from Mr Mandela. 'A casino', the ANC used to sniff dismissively about the institution not so long ago. Policy documents repeatedly called for 'state intervention and regulation' and highlighted the need to 'rationalise and restructure the financial sector'. But Mr Mandela came across as a technocrat pledging greater co-operation between government and the private sector. 'The stock exchange,' he said without a trace of irony, 'has an important role in the reconstruction and development of our country.' Stressing his faith in 'sound market principles', Mr Mandela was at pains to emphasise the 'critical role of business in building our economy'. He cited the ANC's proposed Reconstruction and Development Programme, worth R39bn (Pounds 7.27bn) over five years, which will fund black development projects, as an example of government trying to set a framework to help business. It may have taken four years of hard lobbying by the local and international business community, but Mr Mandela's speech was taken by nervous businessmen as final proof that the ANC seems to have learned that the local stock market, the 11th biggest in the world by capitalisation, will have to play a key role in developing a healthy economy and setting the tone for potential foreign investors. Demonstrating the ANC's new-found sensitivity to market sentiment, Mr Mandela was at pains to reassure dealers about the election itself next week, dismissing the 'prophets of doom' who suggested that blacks would run riot in celebration afterwards. Instead, he suggested, the prospect of a legitimate, democratic government would 'bring the stability needed for international investment'. His farewell waves to black workers showed he still knew who his natural political constituency was, but his audience was reassured. As another broker put it: 'I would be surprised if anyone here voted for him, but I'm a lot more relaxed about him being president.' And as Mr Mandela walked away clutching a memento of his first encounter with unchained capitalism - a set of gold cufflinks embossed with the JSE logo - the real reward for his visit was evident on the floor. Following his talk, the market began to rise on a healthy mix of foreign and domestic buying, and the industrial index finished the day 22 points up at 5,985.

0,FT944-71 ,"FT944-71 _AN-FAAACAC6FT 941231   FT  31 DEC 94 / On The Front Line: Mandela days - War and Peace (Warmongers and Peacemakers)      By MICHAEL HOLMAN   In the year in which southern Africa laid the foundations of a lasting peace, two images stand out. In the first, Nelson Mandela, right hand raised, is sworn in as president of the newly democratic South Africa, in a ceremony which formally ended more than three centuries of white rule. Six months later the same grey-haired septuagenarian is again in front of the cameras, this time posing proudly with a beautiful young woman, the hint of a tear in her eye, resting her head on his broad shoulders. With an enthusiasm for Whitney Houston's charms that belied his years, Mandela declared: 'I'm only here to shine her shoes. She is one of the unpolished jewels in the anti-apartheid struggle.' 'I love you Madiba,' replied Houston, a singer, her eyes glistening, using the clan name for Mandela. Clearly Mandela, now a sprightly 76, is enjoying the status that his personality and newly acquired power have brought, but that does not diminish speculation about his capacity to stand up to the demands of office. Indeed, some observers suggest that Mandela's reverence for Houston smacks of an infatuation that is a sign of approaching dotage, and point out that his aides and doctors have urged him to ease his punishing schedule. It seems unthinkable that Mandela should step down. Ideally, say senior ANC officials, they would like Mandela to see them through the five-year life of the current parliament - none, however, are prepared to suggest that it might already be time for Mandela to retire. Yet age eventually takes its toll - even of a man as resilient as the one who walked out of Cape Town's Pollsmoor prison nearly five years ago. Together with former president FW de Klerk, fellow recipient of the Nobel peace prize, Mandela went on to achieve the seeming impossible - a negotiated end to apartheid. In steering their country through one of history's most extraordinary political transformations, they also liberated southern Africa itself. White South Africa's defence of apartheid had been at the heart of conflicts that have devastated the region, beginning with wars for independence in the early 1960s, and the end of apartheid marked the end of Pretoria's destabilisation of its neighbours. Mandela has since made his influence felt beyond South Africa's borders, playing a leading role in southern Africa's informal grouping known as the front line states, intervening in Lesotho, Angola and Botswana to help secure peace and democracy in the region as a whole. Today, six months after being sworn in as president in Pretoria, Mandela's achievement remains no less remarkable, but a crisis of expectations is developing which will put all his skills to the test. Election euphoria is over, and young blacks are impatient for the fruits of victory. 'We in office, but not in power,' quips one senior official, pointing out that they are the inheritors of a white dominated economy, and dependent on the implementation of reform on a white-dominated civil service. Meanwhile the party itself is showing signs of division within its ranks, and there is a whiff of corruption in the air, as a growing black elite enjoys the benefits of office. South Africa is fortunate to have outstanding potential successors to Mandela, such as Thabo Mbeki, the deputy president, and Cyril Ramaphosa, the party's secretary general. African tradition, however, suggests that 'Madiba' will stay, like other partriarchs of the continent's liberation - Jomo Kenyatta, Houphoet-Boigny, Hastings Banda. Yet this tradition carries a warning. All three countries - Kenya, Ivory Coast, Malawi - initially thrived when these men were in their prime, but went into steep decline as aged, enfeebled, and increasingly autocratic, they kept their people and their parties in harmful thrall.

Addressing a joint news conference with  French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe in Pretoria, he said there  were minority groups which were not only concerned about their  future and values, but which were determined to arrest all  movement to a democratic future. It was the democratic  movement's duty to address the fears of all South Africans,  including those of minorities.    Mr Mandela said an holistic strategy should be applied to  solve the violence. The plan discussed with President F W de  Klerk could be jeopardised if details were published  prematurely, because it involved a number of parties. But Mr  Mandela said measures could include a region being declared a  disaster area, that the entire community be involved in  upgrading programmes, and that hostels be turned into family  units.    Tremendous progress had been made in building a new South  Africa, and there were many people who were determined to  contribute to this process. The ANC would continue trying to  involve the Freedom Alliance and other parties in the elections,  but would proceed without them if necessary.    Polls which indicated a landslide election victory for the  ANC were encouraging, said Mr Mandela but warned against  complacency. The ANC should be on its toes, for while the  government might be tagged as illegitimate, paralyzed by  corruption, and accused of orchestrating violence, it remained  devastatingly effective in elections.    The ANC's National Executive Committee would seriously and  sympathetically consider an invitation from France for South  Africa to join the Franco-African Conference, to be held in  Paris this year.    Mr Juppe announced France was prepared to assist in training  the national peacekeeping force. He added that few countries  were interested in improving links with Africa, and were looking  instead at the Pacific Rim or Latin America, but France would  not forget Africa, and this would ensure a basis for  co-operation.

The arrests mark an important step in a widening investigation by the Tokyo District Public Prosecutor into improprieties at the company. The scandal is expected to involve gangsters and could net politicians as well. The police arrested Mr Hiroyasu Watanabe, former president of Tokyo Sagawa and Mr Jun Saotome, former managing director of the company on charges of breach of trust. Also arrested were Mr Micho Ouchi, former chief accountant at Ichihara Kanko Kaihatsu, a golf course development company, and Mr Yasuo Matsuzawa, president of Heiwado, a medical equipment sales company. Improper loans and loan guarantees from Sagawa were allegedly funneled through the two companies with most of the funds eventually used for speculation in the stock market. This turned sour when the market turned down two years ago. Much of the money, however, is also alleged to have found its way into the hands of gangster-controlled companies associated with the Inagawakai, a large crime syndicate. It was alleged last night that Y5bn was funneled back to both ruling party and opposition politicians through the purchase of tickets for fund-raising events. It is unclear whether this type of political contribution would amount to impropriety on the part of the politicians, or whether Sagawa obtained any political favours as a result. Specific charges against the four men yesterday involved misappropriation of Y12.6bn in loans and loan guarantees. Prosecutors yesterday raided 15 more locations in an effort to assemble more evidence to support the charges. The raids have been well planned and publicised in advance and news of the unfolding scandal now occupies up to half of the 30-minute evening news on NHK, the state broadcasting system. The arrests were shown on television, although public prosectors refused to confirm news of the arrests to foreign journalists on the grounds that to do so would violate the civil rights of the accused. Public interest in the scandal has been heightened by the expectation that it may eventually bring down leading politicians.

By SCOTT KRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER      CAPE TOWN, South Africa      The South African government's negotiations chief said Tuesday that he is  looking for a more ""cooperative attitude"" from the African National Congress  now that President Frederik W. de Klerk has, at great political risk, freed the  guerrilla group to operate openly inside South Africa.    ""I think it is only fair that in answer to the considerable strides the state  president has taken, some steps should at least be taken on the other side to  lessen the gap between the two parties,"" said Gerrit Viljoen, De Klerk's  minister of constitutional development.    But, as Viljoen spoke in Cape Town, ANC leader Walter Sisulu arrived in  Johannesburg after consultations with the ANC executive committee in Europe and  told reporters that the ANC has no plans to open negotiations.    ""There is no question yet of direct discussions with the government,"" the  77-year-old Sisulu said. ""Nothing fundamentally has changed.""    The public sparring indicated the deep divisions, fostered by decades of  animosity and mistrust, that must be overcome by the government and the ANC  before the two leading forces in South African politics can sit down at a  negotiating table and begin discussing a new constitution.    Hopes for breaking the logjam rest largely with jailed nationalist Nelson R.  Mandela, the most widely respected black leader in the country.    The white minority-led government believes that a free Mandela will be able to  persuade the ANC to begin negotiations on power-sharing with the government,  and it wants to grant his wishes, insofar as it is able, to avoid later public  confrontations with Mandela that could scuttle the peace process.    Viljoen, a silver-haired former classics professor who has met Mandela dozens  of times in prison, said Tuesday that the 71-year-old ANC member serving a life  term for sabotage is ""a leader of stature . . . who will make a very important  contribution toward starting negotiations.""    But the Rev. Allan Boesak, who met Mandela on Tuesday, said that while the  black leader called De Klerk's speech ""bold, courageous and hopeful,"" he did  not believe it had cleared the way for talks between the government and the  ANC.    De Klerk says he has decided to release Mandela unconditionally, and Viljoen  says the release will come ""very soon."" But Foreign Minister Roelof F. (Pik)  Botha urged reporters Tuesday ""not to believe people who say the decision rests  solely with the South African government.""    Mandela's wife, Winnie, has said her husband is refusing to leave prison until  the government lifts the 3 1/2-year-old state of emergency and releases all  activists jailed for politically inspired crimes.    But Boesak said the world's most famous prisoner had set no such preconditions.    ""He will not hold onto the chairs and tables and kick and say, 'I won't come  out,' "" Boesak said after a three-hour meeting with Mandela at Victor Verster  prison farm near Cape Town. ""But he will warn them: 'If you do release me and  the conditions that we have put have not been met, then I will be obliged to  make a statement on those conditions.' ""    The government has declined to specify the factors delaying Mandela's release,  other than to cite the prisoner's own ""personal considerations"" and government  worries about his safety.    Botha, one of the architects of De Klerk's liberalization policies, said the  state of emergency, several key provisions of which were eliminated Friday,  will be ended ""as soon as possible."" But he suggested that it might not be  removed before Mandela's release.    ""South Africa has been going through an uneasy time,"" Botha said. ""If we  withdraw all the regulations and suddenly large-scale turbulence starts and  forces us to reintroduce these measures . . . I can assure you we will pay a  heavier price than (if we) just test the waters for awhile.""    In the meantime, the government is seeking an ANC response to its new policy  reforms. In his speech Friday, De Klerk lifted a ban on the ANC and about 60  other anti-apartheid groups, removed restrictions on nearly 400 activists and  rescinded provisions of the emergency decree that had not been comprehensively  enforced.    The moves went a long way toward meeting the pre-negotiation demands of the ANC  and other anti-apartheid groups. The ANC has said it welcomes De Klerk's  actions but has pointed out that several demands remain to be met, including  the release of Mandela and other political prisoners and an end to the  emergency decree.    However, Viljoen described the ANC response thus far as, ""to put it mildly,  rather ambiguous"" and he lamented statements by ANC leaders that included ""the  rumblings and echoes of continuing use of force and violence.""

0,FT922-8595 ,"FT922-8595 _AN-CELA7AF9FT 920512   FT  12 MAY 92 / Mandela warns of threat to S African constitution talks      By RICHARD LAMBERT      JOHANNESBURG   THE COMBINATION of political violence and Pretoria's efforts to retain a white veto was 'serious enough to destabilise' South Africa's constitutional negotiations, Mr Nelson Mandela, the African National Congress president, warned yesterday. In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Mandela repeated his intention to create a government of national unity should the ANC win a general election. He reassured white civil servants and invited foreign businessmen to prepare to invest once an interim government was in place. But while he said he was not seeking a confrontation at the second round of constitutional talks that begin on Friday, Mr Mandela made clear his concern at the wide gap between the ANC and the government. 'It takes more than one person to make a crisis,' he said, responding to reports of deadlock over efforts to pave the way for an interim government, the main objective of the forthcoming talks at the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (Codesa). 'We have no intention of staging any showdowns. We are going there with a spirit of reconciliation, wanting that something should come out of the meeting.' The government had moved its position on some key issues, Mr Mandela noted. 'They were against the idea of an interim government, and a constituent assembly to draw up a new constitution - now they've accepted it.' But he went on to accuse Mr de Klerk of 'clinging to the levers of power'. The ANC envisaged a bill of rights, a national assembly elected on the basis of proportional representation under a multi-party constitution that required a two-thirds majority for any fundamental change. 'We are very concerned that the first government should be seen to represent everybody, and should inspire confidence among all groups in the country,' Mr Mandela said. 'But what we are not prepared to do is to give a minority of less than 15 per cent of the population the right to veto decisions of the majority . . . that is what Mr de Klerk wants, and that we cannot accept.' Political violence was an attempt 'to destabilise the ANC', he said. 'It seems clear to us that the idea is to prevent (the election of) a democratic government dominated by the ANC.' Mr Mandela said of the Codesa talks that 'problems have arisen, some serious enough to destabilise the discussions'. 'For one reason or other, government was not acting' to curb the violence that has left 13,000 dead in the past four years. Government insistence on a white veto and the continuing political killings were 'two issues that threaten the whole negotiating process', he said. 'But we are determined that the process should proceed, and that is why we have demanded immediate installation of an interim government' which would become responsible for security. Asked about plans to reform the white-dominated civil service, Mr Mandela said: 'We do not intend to throw people on to the streets. We do need to democratise the civil service, but it will be done in a humane manner.'  The Financial Times   London Page 20  "

AFRICA      By DAVID LAUTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER      WASHINGTON      The Bush Administration has no plans to lift U.S. sanctions against South  Africa, President Bush indicated Monday, deflecting pressure from some  conservatives who argue that the Pretoria government deserves a concrete reward  for its racial policy reforms.    ""I'm bound by the law"" to maintain the sanctions until the South African  government meets additional conditions, Bush said in a press conference.  Although he could ask Congress to change the law and repeal some or all of the  sanctions, he showed no inclination to do so.    ""I think we ought to give Mr. De Klerk certain credit,"" Bush said, referring to  South African President Frederik W. de Klerk. The South African leader, Bush  said, has proven that he is able to ""look much more realistically about  political change.""    But, when asked if he thinks he needs to make a ""gesture"" to De Klerk to  respond to the release of activist Nelson R. Mandela, Bush said he believes his  invitation to De Klerk and Mandela to visit Washington will suffice.    Some Administration officials, as well as conservatives here and abroad, have  advocated a rapid removal of at least some sanctions. Monday morning, for  example, Herman Cohen, the assistant secretary of state who oversees policy  toward Africa, said the United States should ""make some gesture"" to reward De  Klerk.    ""What we really care about is encouraging further progress,"" said Cohen. ""If  that means relaxation of sanctions, fine.""    Over the weekend, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher sent a letter to  about two dozen world leaders advocating an end to international sanctions  against the De Klerk government.    ""When people are doing the right thing as boldly and courageously as President  De Klerk,"" Thatcher wrote, ""it seems quite absurd to still use sticks to beat  them with, however small those sticks may be.""    So far, Thatcher, who has long been the most outspoken Western leader in  resisting sanctions against the South African regime, appears to be alone in  her call.    Bush in the past has opposed the sanctions, which were adopted over  then-President Ronald Reagan's veto in 1986. He repeated that philosophical  leaning Monday, saying, ""Frankly, I think some (sanctions) are  counterproductive.""    For now, however, Bush seems disinclined to back his philosophy with action,  perhaps wary of the strong domestic opposition he would face. Democrats made  opposition to South Africa a popular issue when Reagan vetoed the sanctions  bill. An active campaign by Bush to remove sanctions would, at minimum,  undermine the efforts his Administration has made to improve relations with  black voters.    Bush said he would consult on the issue with Mandela, who supports continued  sanctions, when the black leader visits Washington. So far, no date has been  scheduled for the visits of either Mandela or De Klerk.    The President also seemed determined to minimize differences between Mandela  and the United States. He brushed aside questions about Mandela's statements  supporting continued armed struggle against the white minority-led government  and praising the South African Communist Party, a long-time ally of Mandela's  African National Congress in the anti-apartheid fight.    ""We've always advocated nonviolence,"" Bush said, but ""I read (Mandela's)  statement to be more on the defensive side"" -- an advocacy of self-defense,  rather than aggressive violence.    Mandela, in a press conference Monday in Johannesburg, defended in theory the  use of force, saying ""the armed struggle is a defensive act against apartheid.""    And on Sunday, in his first speech after his release from prison, Mandela had  said, ""I salute"" the Communist Party for ""its sterling contribution to the  struggle for democracy.""    ""The alliance between ourselves and the party remains as strong as it ever  was,"" Mandela added.    In the past, U.S. administrations have often raised concerns about ties between  the Communists and the African National Congress, the principal guerrilla group  in the struggle against apartheid. This time, however, Bush played down any  such worry.    ""I think these Communist parties are for the most part sliding down hill.  What's coming uphill is democracy and freedom,"" he said. If Mandela pushes  plans to nationalize privately held businesses, Bush said, ""if we have a  difference there, that's fine -- we'll discuss it with him.""    While Bush advocated maintaining the status quo on sanctions, several  congressional Democrats on Monday pushed ahead with plans for bills that would  strengthen the sanctions still further -- imposing what would amount to a  virtual trade ban with South Africa. The move drew support from a spokeswoman  for the ANC.    ""While we welcome Mandela's release with great concern, we note that 2,500  political prisoners remain in jail,"" Lindiwe Mabuza, the ANC's U.S.  representative, said at a Washington press conference. Until further changes  are made in South African government policy, Mandela and other anti-apartheid  activists cannot participate in political debate ""without fears of arrest,  detention, tear gas or clubs,"" she said.

Botha and Nelson Mandela, the imprisoned head  of the African National Congress, was of historic consequence. It recognized  the reality of the black majority, the need for negotiations, the inevitability  of change.    For Botha, 73, two months from retirement and already replaced as leader of the  ruling National Party, the meeting culminated a cautious relaxation of  apartheid that he has implemented. For Mandela, almost 71, perhaps close to  release from prison, it was almost certainly the beginning of formal  consultations in which the ANC will play a major role.    Both Botha and Mandela emphasized the importance of peaceful change in their  45-minute meeting. That is consistent with what the government in Pretoria has  been saying recently about the need for change and what the ANC has been saying  about the need to restrict the use of violence to avoid further acts of  terrorism against civilian populations. There is, of course, no guarantee that  peaceful change is possible at this late date, for neither Botha nor Mandela  can control what whites and blacks will do, and neither can promise an  equitable agreement on the future of the nation. But there is a hope that was  not there before the two men met.    If constructive negotiations do, in fact, result, they will coincide with moves  elsewhere in Africa to resolve a variety of disputes with talk, rather than  arms. There are new proposals for negotiations to end the rebellion in the  southern Sudan and the war between Eritrean liberation forces and Ethiopia.  South Africa has stopped sending arms to the UNITA guerrillas fighting the  government of Angola as part of a broader peace agreement to bring independence  to Namibia and end the Cuban intervention in Angola itself. Only the United  States is continuing to supply lethal equipment to the Angola rebels. And in  Mozambique, there are signs of progress in ending the murderous scorched-earth  warfare of the RENAMO rebels.    Most whites in South Africa apparently cling to the hope that they will be able  to contrive a formula for the future of their country that will guarantee  continued control by the white minority. However, the new Democratic Party,  claiming support of 24% of the white voters, has put forward a proposal for a  nonracial political system, with guarantees for minorities, that would emerge  through a lengthy transition. And the new leader of the National Party, F.W. De  Klerk, in line to succeed Botha as president after the Sept. 6, is expected to  accelerate efforts to eliminate apartheid and extend the vote to the black  majority.    The clandestine meeting between Mandela and Botha is no substitute for the  release of Mandela from prison, for amnesty, for recognition of the ANC, for  accepting the open negotiations. As Mandela explained in a press statement  Wednesday, a negotiated settlement is what the ANC has sought for 28 years.

Addressing the Johannesburg meeting of the Chamber of Mines, an umbrella body representing mining industry interests, Mr Mandela said such a forum could improve productivity and help mines develop education and training initiatives for workers, while improving health and safety measures. 'The mining industry's impressive technological achievements still confront archaic social conditions and a workforce built on a low skills base and largely confined by illiteracy.' While praising the achievements of the industry as 'truly remarkable,' Mr Mandela avoided addressing the question of mineral ownership, merely saying he hoped that 'under whatever form of ownership,' mining would seek 'to uplift the most disadvantaged of our society'. Since last year, a debate has been under way in Mr Mandela's African National Congress on whether the state should assume ownership of all mineral rights, to release under-used deposits for possible exploitation by foreign investors and small black-owned mines, or whether it should accept the private ownership system. Talks between the ANC, the mines and the Department of Mineral and Energy Affairs have been continuing since the April general elections, but the government has yet to make a definitive policy statement on the issue. For the moment, Mr Mandela's address appears to indicate the state's willingness to accept the status quo while encouraging further social responsibility programmes by the mines. Mr Jurie Geldenhuys, outgoing president of the chamber, responded by urging 'a synergistic and co-operative relationship' between government and mining, and praising the administration's non-interventionist approach to the private sector as a whole. But Mr Geldenhuys criticised planned alterations to labour laws, such as more public holidays and a 40-hour maximum work week, as well as tighter environmental controls, charging they constituted 'an anachronism' that could prove extremely costly to the industry.

Speaking briefly outside a private Houghton home where the  two mediators met African National Congress President Nelson  Mandela, Mr Kissinger said the election date had not been  included in the terms of reference the seven mediators received  on Sunday.    The mediators are in South Africa to help mediate in the  election impasse between the ANC and the Inkatha Freedom Party  [IFP]. Mediation is expected to begin on Wednesday (today).    Mr Kissinger said the election date, or what Mr Mandela  called the ""date of freedom for South Africa"", was clearly not a  subject of mediation. He said the mediators were prepared only  to mediate on constitutional issues, the implementation of which  would be left to South Africans. His statement is likely to  cause concern in the IFP camp, which insists that the mediators  also consider changing the election to a later date to allow the  IFP a fair chance to campaign in the event the party decides to  participate.    Mr Mandela said he welcomed the government taking part in  mediation. An agreement could not be effective without the  involvemement of the government. The amended terms of reference  were reasonable, he said.    Mr Mandela also said the election date was not on the  agenda for mediation. The ANC, IFP and government would meet at  2 PM on Wednesday to come to a final agreement on the terms of  reference, he said.    The draft was a good document and a basis from which to move  on the question of mediation. ""My own attitude is positive,"" Mr  Mandela said.    Lord Carrington said the mediators had come to South Africa  ""to do what we can to help"", but it would be up to South  Africans to find their own solutions. ""There has been a  positive attitude on behalf of those we have seen,"" he said.     "
0,FT941-9034 ,"FT941-9034 _AN-EBQDKAAGFT 940217   FT  17 FEB 94 / Mandela acts to avert poll boycott by S African right      By PATTI WALDMEIR      CAPE TOWN   Mr Nelson Mandela, leader of the African National Congress, yesterday announced constitutional concessions aimed at averting a rightwing boycott of South Africa's all-race elections and reducing the threat of violence. 'We must treat the threat of civil war seriously. That is why we have gone out of our way to make these concessions,' Mr Mandela said after an emergency meeting of the ANC's policymaking national executive committee. The concessions would strengthen the powers of provinces under the country's post-apartheid constitution, but they fall short of the demands of the Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom party for provincial autonomy. Mr Rowan Cronje, chairman of the Freedom Alliance which comprises Inkatha and rightwing whites, said he would ask for a meeting with the ANC today. Inkatha said it would study the concessions. However, before the ANC announcement, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, Inkatha leader, speaking in Cape Town, outlined a tougher stance. He said he believed the demand by Zulu king, Goodwill Zwelithini, for an independent Zulu homeland, which Mr Mandela ruled out, was probably 'irreversible'. Mr Mandela proposed constitutional changes are aimed at accommodating not only Inkatha, but also the white rightwing Afrikaner Volksfront, which demands a homeland for Afrikaners. The concessions include powers of taxation for provincial governments and a safeguard for the right to 'self-determination' - a key demand of the white right - as well as measures to protect the powers of provinces when the elected assembly writes a new constitution to replace the 1993 interim constitution. These concessions would probably not affect the basic nature of the current constitution, which provides for strong central government rather than the federal system demanded by Chief Buthelezi. But they would partly meet Chief Buthelezi's concerns, and demonstrate the ANC's willingness to consider compromise. On provincial powers, Mr Mandela said: 'The matter is on the agenda, and we are prepared to hammer out a solution.' He said the ANC approved amending the new constitution to allow consideration of an Afikaner homeland after the election. The ANC also dropped its demand for a single-ballot system in the April 26-28 election, and called for multi-party negotiations to be reconvened on Monday to approve the decision. Separate ballots would be cast in provincial and national elections, favouring the regional parties. President FW de Klerk said parliament would be recalled in March to incorporate the proposed amendments in the constitution and to extend the deadline for parties to register for elections. Government officials argue that this should be done, whether or not the right accepts the amendments, to undermine the right's moral position in boycotting elections.

The National Party  [NP, Nats] asks blacks if they could look a doe-eyed rape-victim  ""in the eye and tell her you're giving a rapist the vote?"" The  Democratic Party [DP] asks coloureds if they could look a  steely-eyed Helen Suzman ""in the eye and say you're voting for  the Nats?"" ""A better life for all""; ""Be sure of a better life"";  ""Jobs, peace, freedom"" -- hype, hype, hype.    Look beyond the pig in the hat, though, and you'll find  intricately devised campaigns. Millions have been spent by the  ANC, NP and DP on print and radio advertisement. If it's hype,  it's carefully managed. On the surface, the strategies  governing the campaigns are:     -  The ANC wishes to assure potential voters that it is well-  prepared to assume government, and that current NP policies have  bankrupted the country and plunged it into violence: ""We cannot  afford more of this.""    -  The NP wishes to make it clear that is has ""made the change""  to  being truly multiracial and that black voters, too, have made  the change and have come on board to support it.    -  The DP wishes to emphasise that it alone can be entrusted  with  providing effective opposition to an ANC-led government; that  the NP and the ANC, both corrupt, are in cahoots, and that only  the DP can protect South Africans ""from the abuse of power"".       You could call the ANC's campaign dry, the NP's campaign  dirty, and the DP's campaign elitist. But none of this is  unintentional. This is advertising -- applied psychology. The  parties are products that need to be sold. Behind these surface  images and words, there are a whole lot of subliminal messages  and unspoken assumptions. And there are mounds and mounds of  research. To begin with, both ANC and the NP have determined  that the other is the only serious contender. And so, even  though the DP's campaign is clever, witty and intentionally  strident to dispel the party's namby-pamby image, it has been  all but ignored by the two major players.    As in all ad campaigns, there are carefully-planned phases.  The ANC's first phase, last year, was the people's forums, to  give the impression of wide consultation. Then there was the  ""Our Plan"" phase, which laid out, in simple terms, the basic  tenets of the party's Reconstruction and Development Programme,  accompanied by poetic-images of roses growing out of barbed wire  or microphones attached to mops. Then there was the ""contrast""  phase, where the ANC compared its plan for the future with  current NP government policy, accompanied this time by gritty  snapshots of unemployed men and weeping women. The ANC is now  moving into a ""reassurance"" phase: expect to see many  comforting images of Nelson Mandela in the last week of the  campaign. Strikingly absent from the ANC campaign has been  hard-hitting negativity: no archival photos dredged up of  Sharpeville or Soweto, or forced removals from District Six or  Sophiatown. ""It would be patronising to tell black South  Africans that they've had a bad life under apartheid,"" says Ken  Modise, responsible for the ANC account at Applied Marketing and  Communications (AMC), a division of Hunt Lascaris. ""They  don't  need to be reminded.""    ANC media man Joel Netshitenzhe gives another reason: ""We  have to acknowledge that the National Party has been successful  in presenting itself as a transformed multiracial party. F.W.  is not P.W.. So rather than going back to the evils of  apartheid, we have to show that, even now, under the new  transformed F.W., policies still discriminate against black  people.""    Modise notes that ""everybody knows the ANC was a highly  effective liberation movement. But will it be an effective  government? South Africans look to the ANC as the incumbent.  We had to be substantial; we had to be serious, to show people  that we had the where-withal to govern.""    Eldad Louw is Modise's counterpart at the NP's ad agency,  Optimum (a division of Saatchi  Saatchi). He believes that  by  mounting ""a campaign of promises"", the ANC dug itself into a  difficult ditch. ""Our research showed that there came a point  when people could no longer believe all the ANC's promises; that  they said, ""that's very nice, but can they deliver?""    Enter the NP, setting out with the avowed intention of  proving to voters -- and particularly black voters -- that the  ANC is not capable of governing. ""What we would have liked to  say,"" says Paris Pitsilledes, a member of the Optimum team, ""is  the following: 'Look how good life was for the whites, now you  can take part in it as well.'"" As one NP ad puts it; ""South  Africa works, so why change it?""    From the very beginning of its campaign, the NP targeted  African voters. This presented the party -- and its advertisers  -- with a problem: ""We treat the party as a product,"" says  Pitsilledes. ""And in the eye of the consumer, this particular  product had a major fault. So we had to go about changing  perceptions of it."" This meant -- in blunt terms -- blackening  it up.    Given that the NP cannot organise effectively in black areas  because of intimidation, advertising has assumed an immense  significance. Just as De Klerk's staged events with traditional  leaders and cheering black NP supporters were calculated to beam  the message into the living-rooms of unsure black voters, that  there are black NP supporters, the NP's advertising campaign --  particularly its latest series of straight-talk endorsements  from black NP members -- is calculated, according to Louw, to  show potential supporters that ""they are not alone, that there  are others who feel the same way as they do.""    Pitsilledes says: ""We've been knocked for taking the  emotional approach, but advertising is not about logic, it's  about emotion"". Precisely because the ANC is making an  emotionally-charged call for the allegiance of black voters, ""we  have to take the emotional approach to negate this"". And so, in  an NP ad, one finds the textbook hear-tug image: the chubby  soft-focus shot of a cute beribboned girl: ""Vote ANC. And  break her heart."" Other NP ads, however, demand serious  attention and have come in for fiery criticism.    Like the ad, flighted last week, showing slain Inkatha  supporters outside ANC headquarters in Johannesburg, above a  quote from THE SOWETAN saying: ""We are sick and tired of the  cynical use of ordinary folk who are also misinformed about the  real causes for marches, for rallies and for the politics of  today."" Or like the series of ads attacking the ANC and the  DP's call to give prisoners the vote. Most controversial was  the ad featuring an identikit of the Station Strangler: ""Can  you imagine the Cape Strangler having the vote? The ANC and DP  can.""    The ANC and DP attacked it as playing on the racist fears of  coloured people, because the identikit is of a man more black  than brown, but NP executive director Olaus van Zyl rejects this  outright: ""It wouldn't matter if the strangler was blue or  white! He's a strangler! A murderer! The issue is, should he  have the vote?""    Racist or not, Pitsilledes said the ad had immense effect  among coloureds in the Western Cape, at whom it was targeted.  And he answers criticism that it was cynical and manipulative  by saying: ""So what? It worked.""    Therein lies a major difference of style between the two  teams doing the ANC and NP campaigns. While Pitsilledes talks  of selling a product, for example, AMC copywriter Steve Shaw  highmindedly explains why the ANC has not used catchy jingles --  as the NP has -- in its radio advertisements: ""We're not  selling dish-washing detergents, we're talking about the future  of this country.""    There's a moral righteousness to the team at AMC; talk  of  ""nation-building"" abounds. Down the road at Optimum, however,  the mood is hard-boiled: ""Sure, the ANC campaign is efficient,""  says Louw. ""But we're looking for effectiveness.""    Their respective attitudes reproduce, almost exactly, the  moods of the campaigns they are working for. Van Zyl goes out  of his way to show that the NP campaign is not a negative one,  citing research figures that show that black people do not go  for negative campaigning. According, to Van Zyl, the NP's  ""sheep in wolf's clothing"" ad, which hit the ANC on the number  of communists on its list, did not go down well among black  voters. Nevertheless, the reality is the NP is the challenger  in this campaign and, as the challenger, it has mounted a far  more robust and strident attack against the ANC than vice-versa.    Whether this tactic has worked will only be known after the  elections. One thing is certain, though: all three parties'  professional and fine-tuned campaigns will change South African  electoral politics for ever. For better or for worse, commerce  has become an integral and indivisible part of election  campaigning.     "

Addressing about  15,000 people at a rally in Wesselton outside Ermelo, he said he  had telephoned Mr de Klerk and Mr Justice Kriegler on Saturday  night after an ANC rally in Kimberley was prohibited in terms of  the declaration. Mr Mandela said Mr de Klerk told him he had  not known about the declaration and the subsequent banning of  the ANC rally. Mr Justice Kriegler, whose commission has to  ensure that the April election was free and fair, had also not  been consulted about the matter.    ""The amount of confusion and lack of consultation among  members of the government is frightening. One department does  not know what another is doing. There are times when even Mr de  Klerk does not know about matters of fundamental importance.""    The ANC leader said the declaration of unrest areas seemed  ""calculated to undermine free and fair elections"".    He said he had also discussed with Mr de Klerk the  controversy surrounding Housing Minister Louis Shill's  R90-billion [rand] housing scheme. He said it was wrong for a  government minister to make announcements on important issues  without prior consultation with other institutions and parties  involved in the transition process. ""These are the actions of a  government which is panicking because they see the writing on  the wall. They are abusing their position to do things which in  terms of the sane policies, they should not be doing.""    Mr Mandela received a thunderous welcome when he arrived at  the Wesselton stadium at about 3PM. Drum majorettes and  drummers led the procession as the ANC leader, on the back of an  open bakkie [pickup truck], waved and gave clenched fists  salutes. Mr Mandela, who was accompanied by the ANC's candidate  premier for the Eastern Transvaal, Matthew Phosa, and Prince  James Mahlangu of the Intando Yesizwe [Will of the Nation] party  of kwaNdebele, also inspected a company of Umkhonto We Sizwe  [Spear of the Nation, ANC armed wing] troops from the Chris Hani  detachment.

TED      By HOWARD ROSENBERG      This one you didn't see on the Fox series ""Cops.""    There he was on perhaps every newscast in the nation, as plain as a picture  taken through a dirty lens, getting busted and handcuffed in a Washington hotel  room by police and FBI agents who barged in as he prepared to leave.    These brief excerpts, showing Washington Mayor Marion Barry getting snared in a  Jan. 18 federal sting operation, were plucked from a videotape shown to jurors  last Thursday in Barry's drug and perjury trial and captured by the ABC News  pool camera in the courtroom. ABC provided the footage and sound to other  broadcasters.    Quite a show. The images, which also appear to show Barry lighting and smoking  a pipe -- allegedly containing crack cocaine -- in the presence of ex-model  Rasheeda Moore, were commanding and indicting. No matter how many qualifiers  anchors and reporters used, the pictures spoke for themselves, delivering a  verdict with a heavy gavel.    Guilty!    This illustrates the danger of drawing conclusions from fleeting excerpts, the  picture or word taken out of context.    That is not to say that the Barry excerpts aren't damning. However, only by  viewing the entire 90-minute videotape -- as shown Thursday and Sunday on  dependable C-SPAN -- can you fully understand why some legal experts have said  there's something in it for the defense as well as the prosecution.    Only then would you see and hear the entire lengthy conversational foreplay to  Barry's arrest, an intimate chattiness that captured the tone of the mayor and  Moore even though many of their words were as inaudible as the pictures were  blurry.    Only then would you probably get the impression that Barry was initially far  less interested in doing drugs than in having sex with the resistant Moore, his  former mistress who had set him up for this sting.    And only then would you hear Barry seemingly being coaxed by Moore to take  drugs.    It was a voyeur's view that the FBI's hidden camera provided, and C-SPAN, with  the luxury of time built into its format, let the tape run to its natural  conclusion. ""It's our philosophy to show you the whole thing when we can,""  senior vice president Susan Swain said from Washington.    In this case, to hear the whole thing, too. After being arrested, Barry aimed  some expletives at Moore. C-SPAN repeatedly ran a crawl alerting viewers to the  raw language punctuating the videotape, but unlike many newscasts, did not  speak over Barry and Moore at any time or run captions drawn from a government  transcript.    One particular sequence from the videotape lingers. It shows Barry, his hands  handcuffed behind his back, berating himself for falling for the sting. ""I  should have known better,"" he mutters, ""I should have known better.""    Following KNBC Channel 4's live coverage of Nelson Mandela's appearance in Los  Angeles Friday -- the best coverage in town thanks to Linda Douglass' reporting  from the field -- came Winnie Mandela's appearance on ""Donahue.""    Showing why, when he's of a mind, he's still the best daytime talk-show host in  the business, Donahue got Mandela to acknowledge that she's angrier than her  husband and more skeptical than he about the white South African government  that has loosened some of the binds of apartheid.    She vowed to return to the bush and ""take up the armed struggle"" should  negotiations fail between the government and African National Congress. That  earned her a standing ovation from the studio audience.    When the history of television in the 20th Century is written, Ted Koppel and  ""Nightline"" will surely loom larger than ""The Arsenio Hall Show.""    Except in St. Louis, perhaps.    In Missouri's largest city, ABC affiliate KTVI-TV has decided to expel  ""Nightline"" from its accustomed 10:30 p.m. (Central time) position to  accommodate Hall's talk-show hour in tandem with something called ""The Party  Machine With Nia Peeples.""    Something smells.    KTVI, which is owned by Times Mirror Broadcasting, is in business to make  money. Fine. Profits are the soul of commercial broadcasting. And you can just  bet that ""The Arsenio Hall Show"" -- which is one of TV's hottest items these  days -- will top ""Nightline"" ratings.    Something still smells.    There are those times when doing what's ""right"" should take precedence over  doing what's most profitable, and this is one of those times. Although Hall's  show adds energy to late-night, laughs and celebrities you can get elsewhere on  TV. ""Nightline"" you can't. If it's true, as a recent Times Mirror survey says,  that today's youth are turned off by world affairs, then undercutting  ""Nightline"" feeds the ignorance and apathy.    ABC has rejected KTVI's offer to delay ""Nightline"" until midnight, citing its  longstanding policy against 90-minute delays for the Koppel show, which emerged  in 1980 as a spinoff from coverage of the Iran hostage crisis.    The network correctly argues that allowing KTVI to delay ""Nightline"" 90 minutes  would set a precedent that other affiliates surely would seek to follow. Some  ABC stations already delay the program for as long as an hour. Moreover, ABC  does allow two of its stations to delay it 90 minutes, but only because they've  been doing so since its inception.    ABC reportedly has had no success finding a home for ""Nightline"" on another St.  Louis station, meaning that the city may lose this centerpiece of ABC News.    How are blockbuster movies made? This helps.    NBC's ""Today"" show followed its three-part series on ""RoboCop 2"" with an even  bigger orgy on behalf of ""Days of Thunder."" Four parts -- including separate  interviews with Tom Cruise and other cast members -- aired last week, with the  fifth scheduled for Tuesday.

TED      By HOWARD ROSENBERG      This one you didn't see on the Fox series ""Cops.""    There he was on perhaps every newscast in the nation, as plain as a picture  taken through a dirty lens, getting busted and handcuffed in a Washington hotel  room by police and FBI agents who barged in as he prepared to leave.    These brief excerpts, showing Washington Mayor Marion Barry getting snared in a  Jan. 18 federal sting operation, were plucked from a videotape shown to jurors  last Thursday in Barry's drug and perjury trial and captured by the ABC News  pool camera in the courtroom. ABC provided the footage and sound to other  broadcasters.    Quite a show. The images, which also appear to show Barry lighting and smoking  a pipe -- allegedly containing crack cocaine -- in the presence of ex-model  Rasheeda Moore, were commanding and indicting. No matter how many qualifiers  anchors and reporters used, the pictures spoke for themselves, delivering a  verdict with a heavy gavel.    Guilty!    This illustrates the danger of drawing conclusions from fleeting excerpts, the  picture or word taken out of context.    That is not to say that the Barry excerpts aren't damning. However, only by  viewing the entire 90-minute videotape -- as shown Thursday and Sunday on  dependable C-SPAN -- can you fully understand why some legal experts have said  there's something in it for the defense as well as the prosecution.    Only then would you see and hear the entire lengthy conversational foreplay to  Barry's arrest, an intimate chattiness that captured the tone of the mayor and  Moore even though many of their words were as inaudible as the pictures were  blurry.    Only then would you probably get the impression that Barry was initially far  less interested in doing drugs than in having sex with the resistant Moore, his  former mistress who had set him up for this sting.    And only then would you hear Barry seemingly being coaxed by Moore to take  drugs.    It was a voyeur's view that the FBI's hidden camera provided, and C-SPAN, with  the luxury of time built into its format, let the tape run to its natural  conclusion. ""It's our philosophy to show you the whole thing when we can,""  senior vice president Susan Swain said from Washington.    In this case, to hear the whole thing, too. After being arrested, Barry aimed  some expletives at Moore. C-SPAN repeatedly ran a crawl alerting viewers to the  raw language punctuating the videotape, but unlike many newscasts, did not  speak over Barry and Moore at any time or run captions drawn from a government  transcript.    One particular sequence from the videotape lingers. It shows Barry, his hands  handcuffed behind his back, berating himself for falling for the sting. ""I  should have known better,"" he mutters, ""I should have known better.""    Following KNBC Channel 4's live coverage of Nelson Mandela's appearance in Los  Angeles Friday -- the best coverage in town thanks to Linda Douglass' reporting  from the field -- came Winnie Mandela's appearance on ""Donahue.""    Showing why, when he's of a mind, he's still the best daytime talk-show host in  the business, Donahue got Mandela to acknowledge that she's angrier than her  husband and more skeptical than he about the white South African government  that has loosened some of the binds of apartheid.    She vowed to return to the bush and ""take up the armed struggle"" should  negotiations fail between the government and African National Congress. That  earned her a standing ovation from the studio audience.    When the history of television in the 20th Century is written, Ted Koppel and  ""Nightline"" will surely loom larger than ""The Arsenio Hall Show.""    Except in St. Louis, perhaps.    In Missouri's largest city, ABC affiliate KTVI-TV has decided to expel  ""Nightline"" from its accustomed 10:30 p.m. (Central time) position to  accommodate Hall's talk-show hour in tandem with something called ""The Party  Machine With Nia Peeples.""    Something smells.    KTVI, which is owned by Times Mirror Broadcasting, is in business to make  money. Fine. Profits are the soul of commercial broadcasting. And you can just  bet that ""The Arsenio Hall Show"" -- which is one of TV's hottest items these  days -- will top ""Nightline"" ratings.    Something still smells.    There are those times when doing what's ""right"" should take precedence over  doing what's most profitable, and this is one of those times. Although Hall's  show adds energy to late-night, laughs and celebrities you can get elsewhere on  TV. ""Nightline"" you can't. If it's true, as a recent Times Mirror survey says,  that today's youth are turned off by world affairs, then undercutting  ""Nightline"" feeds the ignorance and apathy.    ABC has rejected KTVI's offer to delay ""Nightline"" until midnight, citing its  longstanding policy against 90-minute delays for the Koppel show, which emerged  in 1980 as a spinoff from coverage of the Iran hostage crisis.    The network correctly argues that allowing KTVI to delay ""Nightline"" 90 minutes  would set a precedent that other affiliates surely would seek to follow. Some  ABC stations already delay the program for as long as an hour. Moreover, ABC  does allow two of its stations to delay it 90 minutes, but only because they've  been doing so since its inception.    ABC reportedly has had no success finding a home for ""Nightline"" on another St.  Louis station, meaning that the city may lose this centerpiece of ABC News.    How are blockbuster movies made? This helps.    NBC's ""Today"" show followed its three-part series on ""RoboCop 2"" with an even  bigger orgy on behalf of ""Days of Thunder."" Four parts -- including separate  interviews with Tom Cruise and other cast members -- aired last week, with the  fifth scheduled for Tuesday.    All this for a movie of such modest merit that the best thing ""Today"" critic  Gene Shalit could say in its behalf last week was that it should turn out to be  a blockbuster.

He was presenting the ANC's three-pillar  election manifesto at Nasrec, south-west of Johannesburg, which  promises good form of government, a better quality of life for  South Africans and end to crime and violence.    The document is moderate in tone and bases the promises it  makes on a growing economy. Mr Mandela conceded that  implementation and financing of the programme would not be easy.    ""Our objective is to use resources more efficiently and not  to increase the tax burden. Large sums of money already go to  education, health and other areas. But the results are poor,"" Mr  Mandela said.    The ANC would encourage an open and democratic society and  would respect a bill of rights. Government corruption and  dishonesty would not be tolerated.    Turning to the second pillar of the manifesto, Mr Mandela  warned that South Africa's economy would no longer be run for  the benefit of the white minority. The manifesto prioritises job  creation and better incomes in a growing economy, marked by  increased foreign investment, a public works programmes  providing 2.5-million jobs over the next 10 years and more  roads, schools, clininc and houses. Small business would be  encouraged and rural poverty eliminated through development  programmes.    Woman and those earning under R[Rand]4,000 a month are  promised a better tax deal.    The manifesto says the security forces will be refomed to  reflect the national gender and character of South Africa.  ""Criminal behaviour in these forces will not be tolerated. Those  serving today will be encouraged to continue in line with the  new culture,"" the manifesto said.    It promises that with the cooperation of commmunities, an  ANC-government will ensure criminals are dealt with to the full  extent of the law. ""The ANC recognises the depth of our  country's crisis. We are convinced that political will, an  environment of peace and stability and a technically sound  programme are a sure foundation for reconstruction and  development.    ""The ANC pledges to spare no effort to reach these ideals.  We  are ready to tackle the problems.""     "

Castro made the remark as he boarded an airplane in Accra,  the capital of Ghana, after a 12-hour stopover en route to  Pretoria, where the first black president in South African  history will take office on 10 May.    ""I am very pleased to have stopped over in Ghana and to have  met with the Ghanaian people,"" said the Cuban leader, whom  Ghanaian President Jerry John Rawlings welcomed last night at  Katoka Airport.    Concerning his meeting with Rawlings, a longtime friend,  Castro said he was very pleased, although the meeting was very  brief, because Rawlings was also traveling to South Africa.    Castro's trip to South Africa is an important, historic  event. Mandela was in jail just five years ago for trying to  eliminate the system of apartheid and when Cuban troops were  fighting in southern Angola against the South African Army.     "
0,FT922-1535 ,"FT922-1535 _AN-CFVA1AC3FT 920622   FT  22 JUN 92 / ANC halts talks after township massacre: South African power-sharing negotiations 'in tatters', says Mandela      By PHILIP GAWITH      JOHANNESBURG   SOUTH AFRICA'S peace process was in danger of collapse last night after Mr Nelson Mandela, president of the African National Congress (ANC), announced the suspension of bilateral talks with the government. Mr Mandela's decision follows the massacre last Wednesday of 42 people in Boipatong township. A further three people died on Saturday when police opened fire on a crowd which had gathered to protest at the killings. The ANC has blamed Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom party for Wednesday's tragedy, and accused the police of complicity, a charge which is denied by the government. 'I can no longer explain to our people why we continue to talk to a regime that is murdering our people and conducting war against us,' Mr Mandela said. He also said he would lead a campaign of defiance should the government reimpose a state of emergency, as suggested by President FW de Klerk after his abortive visit to Boipatong on Saturday when angry youths chased him out of the township. The negotiation process was 'completely in tatters', Mr Mandela told a rally yesterday of about 15,000 supporters in the township of Evaton, 50km south of Johannesburg. He said an emergency meeting of the National Executive Committee of the ANC would be held tomorrow to 'examine our options' in the light of the events at Boipatong. While militant elements within the ANC would favour calling off negotiations, this can, at best, be a short-term measure. With sanctions gone and the armed struggle suspended, the ANC lacks the means to force the government from power. It will probably show its displeasure by intensifying mass action while making its continued participation in negotiations contingent on a suitable government response to Boipatong. Mr Mandela's comments came at the end of a week which saw relations between the government and ANC sink to their lowest level since the unbanning of the ANC in February 1990. 'We are back to Sharpeville days and the gulf between the oppressor and the oppressed has overnight become unbridgeable.' Earlier Mr Mandela had visited Boipatong where the rapturous reception afforded him contrasted sharply with the hostility towards Mr de Klerk, whose visit lasted less than 15 minutes. The Vaal Triangle townships visited yesterday by Mr Mandela are among the most volatile and dangerous in the country. The road from Boipatong to Evaton, which passes through Sebokeng, resembles a war zone. Burnt tyres, rocks and tree-stumps are strewn across all the main streets to discourage police patrols and attacks launched from fast-moving cars. The mood of the crowd in the dusty football ground where Mr Mandela spoke was very militant. Posters read 'Mandela - give us permission to kill our enemies'. Mr Mandela reminded his audience that the infamous Sharpeville massacre in 1960 had occurred in the same vicinity as Boipatong. 'I come back today to this area where Sharpeville has been repeated with a ferocity that may completely put an end to negotiations with the regime.' He said he would request the secretary-general of the United Nations to call a special session of the Security Council to discuss the 'massacres committed by Mr de Klerk and his regime'.

The proclamation was published in a Government Gazette  Extraordinary the same night after the Minister of Justice  requested the President to extend the terms from yesterday until  May 17 1995.

The Cuban delegation, headed by Castro, was one of the most  eagerly awaited here. The African people believe that Cuba,  particularly Fidel, had to participate in the celebration of  Mandela's victory, according to opinions expressed yesterday  during Castro's brief stopover in Accra, the capital of Ghana.    During his brief visit, Castro had a friendly meeting that  lasted until the late hours with President Jerry John Rawlings,  who welcomed Castro at the international airport in this capital  and invited him to the presidential residence, where they  discussed matters of common interest, particularly within the  African context.    Tomorrow both Rawlings and Castro will participate in the  ceremony during which outgoing South African President Frederik  de Klerk will transfer the government to President-elect Nelson  Mandela. It will be a momentous ceremony not only in the  history of this country but for the entire black continent as it  marks the end of apartheid.

""Fidel Castro's presence at Mandela's inauguration is not  merely a matter of protocol,"" Foreign Minister Robaina told  PRENSA LATINA today. ""We want to show that Cuba's ties with the  people of South Africa and of this continent were forged in the  struggle for independence and strengthened by the blood shed by  hundreds of Cubans who fell fighting against the same forces  that the ANC now defeated at the polls,"" he added.    Mandela's ANC won the 27 April elections and will create a  government of national unity in which de Klerk will be the  second vice president.    In Fidel Castro's opinion, ""the most difficult task for  South  Africa begins now, but Mandela is the perfect man for the job  because he has the wisdom and talent that the political climate  demands.""

With joy and emotion, Mr Mandela proclaimed: 'Thank God almighty, we are free at last.' Jubilation broke out in black townships around the country as it became clear that the ANC was headed for control of the new parliament. Even the vanquished entered into the spirit of the moment, with President F. W. de Klerk conceding defeat with words of generosity and warmth for his new boss in the government of national unity. Mr de Klerk ended a nationally-televised address with the words 'God bless South Africa, Nkosi Sikele', African nationalism's hymn of liberation, now adopted as one of South Africa's two national anthems. Mr Mandela said it was 'a joyous night for the human spirit' and recounted the many phone calls of congratulation he had received from almost all of South Africa's political leaders, including Mr de Klerk and right-wing leader General Constand Viljoen. Only Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, leader of the Inkatha Freedom party and Mr Mandela's main black rival, failed to join in the national catharsis. Last night he warned of possible trouble because not everyone would accept a large national victory for the ANC. Earlier, Mr de Klerk had pledged his support for an ANC-led government of national unity. 'Mr Mandela has walked a long road and now stands at the top of the hill. A man of destiny knows that beyond this hill lies another and another. The journey is never complete. As he contemplates the next hill, I hold out my hand to Mr Mandela in friendship and in co-operation,' he told his party faithful. As results continued to trickle in, it became clear that the two men would be working together as the two largest parties in the new government. ANC information director Pallo Jordan predicted that the ANC would not gain the two-thirds majority needed to give it absolute power over the parliament in the writing of a new constitution, but would score between 58 and 62 per cent of the vote. With 43.9 per cent of the estimated 23m votes counted, the ANC had a commanding lead with 63.3 per cent of the national vote, with the National Party running at 23.3 per cent. No other party came close to these totals: the Inkatha Freedom Party scored 5.9 per cent of the vote, the rightwing Freedom Front of Gen Constand Viljoen 2.8 per cent, the liberal Democratic Party 1.8 per cent and the ultra-left Pan Africanist Congress 1.3 per cent. However, it is impossible to extrapolate from these figures, because results are being released without identifying the neighbourhoods from which they come. With residential areas so sharply divided by race, and with party support also following racial lines, a concentration of results from one racial area can substantially falsify projections. In the provincial elections, the ANC was the runaway leader in the Northern Transvaal, Eastern Transvaal, North-West, Orange Free State and Eastern Cape. It remains unclear whether it would win the Northern Cape, Natal and the Pretoria Witwatersrand and Vereeniging area. In one of the few clear outcomes, the ANC conceded it had lost the Western Cape province - one of only two provinces which do not have a majority of Africans - to the National party. Many uncertainties remain. In the disputed Natal province, only a fraction of votes have been counted, apparently from areas where Inkatha is strong. No accurate projections can be made from these early results.

Mr Nelson Mandela, president of the African National Congress, is on the right side of history, and that will put his party on the right side of victory as well. For neutral observers that has taken some of the excitement out of the election campaign. But partisan participants have had no trouble getting excited about the campaign. Certainly, Mr Mandela has loved it, and the crowds have loved him. 'Although I am 75 years of age, when I am among you I feel like a young man of 16. You are the people who inspire me every day of my life.' He has paid this tribute to countless crowds, and he has never sounded less than sincere, however often he has said it. 'I am humbled to represent the work and struggle of so many people who made democracy a reality in our country.' No one is tempted to disbelieve him. Mr Mandela is a natural, with his radiant smile and his obvious love for his people. Unlike President FW de Klerk, the National party leader - who arrives at rallies surrounded by a phalanx of security men and only smiles on cue - Mr Mandela's smile is straight from the soul (and his security is too often ignored). He spends as much time as possible shaking hands and displaying his regal physique to adoring crowds, whether standing on the back of a truck to make a circuit of a football field, or sticking his torso through the sun roof of his car to tour townships waving like royalty. But there is another side to the septuagenarian leader: he is one of South Africa's most boring speakers. By the time he finishes, he has often lost half the crowd. But he is not deterred. With his forefinger wagging in a style first popularised by former President PW Botha, Mr Mandela delivers headmasterly lectures condemning mass protest action (pioneered by the ANC, but no longer welcome now it is assuming power), urging co-operation with the police and tribal chiefs (hated symbols of apartheid), even extolling the virtues of punctuality. Mr Mandela persists with his stern lectures, oblivious of the reaction of his supporters. And that fact tells the real truth about the campaign: that it is not a contest at all. There are almost no 'swing voters'. It is inconceivable that many of those viewing a recent televised debate between Mr Mandela and Mr de Klerk were trying to decide between the two contestants. South Africa simply does not work like that; people do not leave the ANC camp to join the NP, or vice versa. The gulf is too wide. Mr Mandela's greatness lies in his efforts to bridge that gap.

0,FT934-14533 ,"FT934-14533 _AN-DJQAAAALFT 931016   FT  16 OCT 93 / Nobel prize for Mandela and de Klerk      By KAREN FOSSLI      OSLO   MR Nelson Mandela, president of the African National Congress, and President F. W. de Klerk yesterday shared the 1993 Nobel Peace Prize for working to dismantle South Africa's apartheid regime and for laying the foundations for peace and democracy in the violence-torn country. The five-member Norwegian Nobel Committee said that from their different points of departure, Mr Mandela and Mr de Klerk were being lauded for reaching agreement on the principles for a transition to a new political order based on the tenet of one man, one vote. 'By looking ahead to South African reconciliation instead of back at the deep wounds of the past, they have shown personal integrity and great political courage,' it said. In an interview with Norwegian radio soon after the award was announced, Mr de Klerk said he was overwhelmed by the decision: 'It's a great honour and I accept it with great humility. I accept it on behalf of all other leaders who have contributed towards the dynamic process in South Africa.' He stressed that economic development of South Africa was needed to help end violence there. 'We are glad to be back in the international community and that sanctions have been lifted. We hope that investment can come to South Africa so jobs can be created.' Mr Mandela described the honour as a 'challenge to us all as co-equal compatriots to so conduct ourselves that those who seek to foster racial and ethnic hatred and war are isolated and cauterised'. The Nobel committee said South Africa had been the symbol of racially conditioned suppression. 'Mandela's and de Klerk's constructive policy of peace and reconciliation also points the way to the peaceful resolution of similar deep- rooted conflicts elsewhere in the world,' where ethnic disparities cause the bitterest conflicts, it said. The committee said that while previous Nobel laureates Albert Lutuli and Desmond Tutu made important contributions to progress towards racial equality in South Africa, Mr Mandela and Mr de Klerk have taken the process a big step further. Professor Francis Sejersted, chairman of the committee, said the South African duo had bound their political fate to achieving peace. He said the committee's reasons for yesterday's decision were similar to those behind the awards to former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev in 1990 and to Ms Rigoberta Menchu' Tum, the Guatemalan human rights campaigner, last year. 'Similar political peace processes are also under way in those laureates' countries,' he said. The Nobel Peace Prize, named after Mr Alfred Nobel, the Swedish inventor of dynamite, comprises a gold medal, a diploma and a cheque for SKr6.7m (Pounds 550,000). Prof Sejersted believed Mr Mandela and Mr de Klerk would come to Oslo on December 10 to receive the prize.   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.   Industries:-  P9721 International Affairs.

In a message released in Pretoria by the Caribbean  delegation, Castro told the South African president-elect of the  Cuban people's joy over the establishment of a multiracial and  democratic government in South Africa.    The Cuban head of state said in brief statements to PRENSA  LATINA he wishes Mandela peace, harmony, and unity in the great  task he must fulfill as of tomorrow when, during a solemn  ceremony, he takes the oath as president of South Africa.    Castro had earlier expressed joy at being in South Africa  for  Mandela's inauguration. The two men will meet for the first  time in Pretoria tomorrow, during the solemn ceremony.    Castro added this is an important day: ""It is an opportunity  to experience an event of historic importance for the peoples of  Cuba and the world,"" he said.    The Cuban president is one of 42 heads of state who have  announced they would attend the event, which will also be  attended by many well-known figures.    The Caribbean statesman arrived in Pretoria by highway from  Johannesburg, where he arrived on Monday on a flight from Accra,  where he spent a 12-hour technical stopover en route from  Barbados.    Castro was welcomed in Ghana by his friend Ghanaian  President  Jerry John Rawlings, who within the past few hours also traveled  to South Africa where the presidents of Nigeria, Angola,  Zimbabwe, Sudan, and Palestine have already arrived.    A source close to the Cuban delegation disclosed Castro has  already received several requests for interviews and meetings  from heads of state and government, and from journalists who are  in South Africa.    Among the earliest requests were those from the presidents  of  Sudan, Nigeria, the PLO, and South African television stations.    It is expected the period following Mandela's inauguration  will be one of intense work for Castro, the source added.    The Cuban high-level delegation is lodged at the Arcadia  Hotel and consists of Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina, Ricardo  Alarcon, president of parliament, and Environment, Science, and  Technology Minister Rosa Elena Simeon.

To be called the National  Intelligence Agency, the new service will operate for an interim  period prior to a fundamental reorganisation of the intelligence  services.    The high-level political tug of war comes amid reports that  President Nelson Mandela has agreed to cede control of  intelligence matters to his deputy, F.W. de Klerk, in an  apparent barter for ANC control of the police and the South  African National Defence Force. Senior sources say ""De Klerk is  attempting to grab control of intelligence,"" with Mandela -- who  is officially minister of intelligence -- still studying the  implications of delegating his authority.    Intelligence officials familiar with the integration debate  are understood to have advised Mandela against including  intelligence in the national unity trade-off. They fear that  unless the intelligence services report to the president, they  could continue to function in a partisan manner. Inclined  towards the NP [National Party] by tradition, they could become  a powerful weapon in De Klerk's hands in the run-up to the next  election.    Senior ANC officials have indicated that structures  currently  being finalised will ensure presidential control of the shadow  services. The new intelligence dispensation is likely to  include four agencies.    Military Intelligence will return to its classic role of  information gathering and analysis on potential threats to the  sovereignty and integrity of the country. Police intelligence  could be restricted to information gathering on criminals,  including international gun runners and drug dealers.    The current premier political intelligence service, the  National Intelligence Service, is to be divided into two  agencies, one responsible for domestic surveillance and  analysis, the other involved in international work. It is  unclear whether any or all of the agencies will have police  powers such as the right of arrest, or whether the German model  of a strict separation of powers will be followed.    A national intelligence co-ordinating mechanism, most  probably a committee made up of the heads of all the agencies,  will report to a state secretary for intelligence in the  president's office. This is likely to be a political appointee,  possibly ANC security chief Joe Nhlanhla if Mandela holds on to  intelligence.     "

By SCOTT KRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER      JOHANNESBURG, South Africa      The African National Congress' decision to suspend planned talks with Pretoria,  imperiling the South African peace process even before it begins, is a clear  sign that ANC leaders and their supporters remain deeply divided over the idea  of negotiating with the white-led government, analysts said Sunday.    ""The ANC leadership is out of touch with the kind of passions and concerns on  the ground, where many still find it very difficult to talk to 'the oppressor  (the government),' "" said Robert Shrire, a professor of African studies at the  University of Cape Town.    Suddenly backing away from a promise to meet with the government is the  ""politically inept way in which a fairly leaderless movement is responding  opportunistically to grass-roots pressure,"" Shrire added.    The extent of the turmoil in the ANC's leadership ranks was evident at a news  conference Sunday when Nelson R. Mandela, the new ANC deputy president,  acknowledged differences of opinion with his colleagues.    Earlier Sunday, Mandela told an estimated 300,000 people at an ANC rally near  Port Elizabeth that he is prepared to meet with President Frederik W. de Klerk  soon to discuss ways of ending renewed violence in the country. But he said he  will not lead an official delegation for talks with De Klerk's government until  Pretoria responds to ANC complaints about police killings of peaceful  demonstrators. Only then, Mandela said, will the ANC and the government work  out a new date for formal talks.    Most political analysts believe that the ANC has the most to lose by delaying  its first face-to-face meeting with the government, which had been scheduled  for April 11 in Cape Town. The two sides were to discuss obstacles to  black-white talks, which include ANC demands that the 45-month-old state of  emergency be lifted and that political prisoners be freed.    The ANC, in a telephone call from Mandela to De Klerk on Friday, called off  those historic talks to protest police shootings in Sebokeng that touched off a  day of violence and left at least 15 black protesters dead.    De Klerk has won worldwide praise for his efforts to get negotiations with the  black majority under way and his willingness to talk to the ANC -- the first  white South African leader in 40 years to open his door to the movement. The  ANC, by refusing to at least talk with De Klerk, risks being branded an  extremist organization and losing support internationally as well as from the  South African whites it is trying to woo.    De Klerk has promised to look into the police shootings, but he said such  incidents are the key reason that the government and the ANC need to begin  talking. ""I told Mandela my door remained open and he was welcome to meet with  me,"" De Klerk said.    The ANC, the primary anti-apartheid movement in the country, has been rocked by  the rapid reforms introduced by De Klerk. Since De Klerk legalized the ANC and  freed Mandela last month, the ANC has been trying to reformulate its policies  while re-establishing itself inside the country.    Several generations of ANC leaders inside the country now are free from prison,  but the final decisions are made by the ANC's 35-member national executive  committee, which has yet to return from exile in Zambia.    ANC support inside the country over the years has been spread broadly across  the spectrum of black politics, from radical young activists to older  moderates. Now, disagreement among ANC leaders over how to respond to De  Klerk's initiatives has robbed the group of the powerful voice it needs to  bring its supporters in line, analysts say.    ""They're having serious problems on the ground,"" says a leader of the rival  Pan-Africanist Congress (PAC). Support already appears to be growing for more  radical black groups such as the PAC, which has flatly refused to negotiate  with the government until it dismantles apartheid and agrees to hand over power  to the black majority.    De Klerk supports a one-person, one-vote system but wants whites protected from  black domination. Blacks, who have no vote in national affairs, outnumber  whites 4 to 1 in South Africa.    De Klerk has taken considerable political risks in loosening restrictions on  political expression to lure black leaders to his negotiating table. So far he  has managed to maintain white support for those reforms, but many whites are  worried about the upsurge of violence, and analysts think the president needs  to make rapid progress toward a peaceful resolution.    The desire of older ANC leaders, especially the 71-year-old Mandela, to talk  with De Klerk has divided ANC supporters.    ""The ANC leadership has gone the celebrity route rather than the organizational  route,"" Shrire said. ""While they've been acting as international stars, no one  has been at home minding the store.""    Disarray in the ANC hierarchy has been evident for weeks. Last week, the ANC  suddenly backed out of a joint rally in which political rivals Mandela and Zulu  Chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi would have shared a podium in a bold attempt  to end the bloody factional fighting between their supporters in Natal  province.

A few minutes after 1300 in Cuba --  1900 in South Africa -- the plane carrying Fidel and his  delegation landed at Jan Smuts International Airport,  Johannesburg, the first stop in South Africa.    We traveled approximately 45 km by road to Pretoria where  workers are putting the finishing touches on the site of the  ceremony that will end the apartheid regime by placing Mandela  at the nation's helm. Mandela received an absolute majority of  the votes in the first multiracial elections ever held in South  Africa.    At the Arcadia Hotel where the Cuban delegation headed by  Fidel is staying, numerous requests for interviews and contacts  have been received from heads of states and journalists here to  attend the inauguration. We can therefore assume that Fidel will  be extremely busy after the inauguration. Among those who have  asked to meet with Fidel are South African television, the PLO,  and the heads of state of Sudan and Nigeria.    Before leaving Ghana for South Africa, Fidel spoke with the  reporters accompanying him and discussed his presence at the  inauguration of the African National Congress's leader.    [Begin recording] [Bel] How do you feel about going to the  inauguration ceremony?    [Castro] I feel very good in every sense of the word. I am  in  great health. I slept well and am very happy to be on my way to  the inauguration.    [Bel] What does attending Mandela's inauguration mean to  you?    [Castro] It represents an opportunity to participate in an  historic event such as this, which the peoples of Africa and the  world are experiencing.    [Bel] Thank you.    [Castro] And also, we cannot waste a single minute, so we  get  there on time.    [Unidentified reporter] What can you tell us about your  meeting with Rawlings?

Mr Mandela, on a four-day visit to Britain, said an ANC-led government would offer fiscal incentives to persuade investors to set up plants and joint-venture companies in deprived areas of South Africa. Addressing business leaders in Birmingham, ahead of a conference on the South African economy in London today, he highlighted the northern Cape and black homelands such as Transkei as areas where international companies should launch subsidiary operations. 'There will be tax incentives for the next five years and other strategies to ensure we spread the benefits of investment to the poorest areas,' he said. Mr Mandela said the incentives, part of an investment code drawn up by the ANC, did not involve an obligation on companies to invest only in areas of high unemployment and social deprivation. They would form the centrepiece of an appeal to foreign investors to help equalise economic disparities between black and white communities. The investment code also guaranteed that overseas companies could repatriate profits and dividends on earnings made in South Africa. Acknowledging that the ANC's commitment to nationalisation could prove a disincentive to overseas investors, Mr Mandela said the emphasis on state ownership had been diluted by the party's policy makers. But he warned large-scale state intervention was unavoidable to overcome structural problems in the South African economy. Areas the ANC plans to address include 'the 98 per cent of industrial property controlled by whites and the 86 per cent of shares on the Johannesburg stock exchange held by just five corporations'. In London today, Mr Mandela is expected to reaffirm his appeal for economic aid during meetings with Mr John Major, UK premier, and the Confederation of British Industry. He will address the CBI along with Mr Derek Keys, South African trade minister, and Mr Richard Needham, Mr Keys' British counterpart.   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.

He  may only have got 20.5 per cent of the 19m votes cast in last  month's elections, but for a party that carries the stigma and  apartheid burden of the National party, it was an astonishingly  high figure.    Far from consigning himself to the political graveyard and a  life of retirement in his Cape Town cottage, de Klerk is already  planning a political comeback. ""I believe my party is poised as  the party with the greatest growth potential,"" he says, without  a flicker of a smile. ""We look at the future and in the party  political sense -- while fully co-operating with the government  of national unity -- we will be looking for a win in the next  election.""    It is a statement which, coming lrom the leader of the  National party, the same internationally reviled party that for  more than 40 years deprived blacks of their civil rights and  stripped the coloureds (mixed-race people) of their right to  vote, seems bizarre, even absurd. Yet is it? In last month's  election de Klerk's party won almost 4m votes, possibly as many  as 1m of them black votes. Fewer than 60 per cent of whites  voted for him, but probably as many as 70 per cent of coloureds  and 63 per cent of Indians preferred the new, apartheid cleansed  National party to any of the other 18 parties that sought their  vote.    I last interviewed de Klerk in his office in Pretoria a week  before the election when his staff were hoping to achieve  between 25 per cent and 30 per cent of the vote, and some even  talked about 35 per cent. Against that, his party's showing  might be viewed as a disappointment. But it was still, he  points out, the highest figure any opinion poll ever accorded  them -- and with the national party machine he is now building,  it can do better next time.    ""The National party has become the leading non-racial party  in South Africa,"" he says, and it is true: the African National  Congress's support was almost entire black, and Chief Mangosuthu  Buthelezi's support came from the Zulus of Natal and a number of  disaffected whites.    As such, insists de Klerk, the ""Nats"" should regain not only  the white votes that went to the Democratic party as well as to  Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom party, keep control of the coloureds  and Indians who are mostly Afrikaans speakers (and more  anti-black than they were ever anti-white), and attract a  growing number of aspiring middle-class blacks. For the moment,  however, de Klerk, in London last week to deliver The Sunday  Times Nobel Laureate Peace lecture to nearly 3,000 people at the  Albert Hall, has the more immediate task of making the new  government of national unity work. In the past fortnight he has  handed over officially to Nelson Mandela and moved out of the  state president's office suite once occupied by Smuts, Malan,  Verwoerd and Botha.    His new office will be a mirror suite on the other side of  the same building, on the same floor as Mandela and only a short  walk to the office of his fellow ""executive"" deputy president,  Thabo Mbeki.    The ""executive"" bit of the title, he says, has been recently  added to emphasise the fact that the two deputies will play key  roles in managing the new government. After the election  Mandela took a brief holiday, leaving de Klerk and Mbeki in  joint charge, and so far they have not come to blows.    ""We've already struck a very good working relationship,""  says  de Klerk, and most observers believe that to be true, the two  men forming a respect for each other in the months of tough  negotiation that led up to the election. The two deputy  presidents are now effectively the joint chief executives of  South Africa, with Mandela assuming the role of non-executive  chairman. They have not yet settled into a work routine, but  have spent the hours and days since the election trying to  thrash out a system of cabinet committees through which their  powers will be exercised.    Mbeki, like all the ANC, has no experience of government and  seems prepared to be guided by his more seasoned partner. How  long the smooth partnership will last under the strains that lie  just around the corner is another matter, but de Klerk is  putting an optimistic gloss on it.    One of the key points, he insists, is that he is not a  Mandela appointee. ""I'm not there because I've been invited to  be there. I'm there because the constitution says I've a right  to be there. because 4m voters said they wanted me there. Even  if President Mandela disliked me intensely, he would have had to  accept me."" Mandela, in fact, seems to hold him in even greater  respect than Mbeki does, and although there have been some signs  of friction between them over several of the cabinet  appointments, all three of them seem determined to work together.    The constitution, says de Klerk, insists that the president  must consult his deputies on a whole series of important issues,  notably appointments, and he will make sure that happens to the  letter. ""I see us being involved in the totality.""    The first real cabinet session takes place tomorrow with  Mandela in the chair, flanked by his two deputies, and down the  table the brooding figure of Buthelezi, who has been seen  striding the floors of the Ministry of Home Affairs where he is  in charge. This is where the first real tensions could surface.    De Klerk has gone out of his way to keep Buthelezi informed  about the way in which the cabinet committees are developing,  seeking his support not as a minister but as the head of one of  the three political parties that make up the government.  Mandela, he indicates, has done the same and so far Buthelezi  seems to be settling down to his life as a national minister, as  opposed to his years of being chief minister in his own little  fiefdom of KwaZulu.    If Buthelezi, says de Klerk, is not drawn into the process  of  government, there would be a real danger that the cooperation of  the parties within the cabinet would falter. ""There is a  commitment from me and from Mandela to make that work."" On the  other hand, de Klerk and Buthelezi are allies against what could  be the overpowering might of the ANC. ""We are not there, and  Buthelezi isn't there, to implement to the letter ANC policy,""  he says. ""That would make a farce of the concept of a  government of national unity.""     "

In the first speech by a secretary of state exclusively devoted to Africa policy since the end of the cold war, Mr Warren Christopher said the US-led effort, in which it expected co-operation from others in the Group of Seven leading industrial nations, would begin once a transitional executive council has been put in place and a firm date for elections set. Before that, Mr Christopher went on: 'We have urged the World Bank and the parties in South Africa to begin planning now the projects that will lead to economic growth.' He hoped US businesses would be in the vanguard of investment in South Africa. He had special praise for both Mr Nelson Mandela and President F W de Klerk for the 'monumental achievement' of making free and fair elections possible. 'That election will echo around the African continent and across the world as a roaring triumph of human rights,' he said. Mr Christopher placed his commitment to assist the South African economy firmly in the context of the promotion of democracy throughout the continent. 'That is why President Clinton chose to invite the first president of a democratic Namibia, Sam Nujoma, as the first African head of state to be recognised at his White House.' Elsewhere in his speech, he bluntly referred to President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire as an example of 'corrupt dictators' but he singled out no other African autocrat, preferring instead to praise unnamed 'courageous democrats' from Senegal to Benin and Madagascar to Mali, and to warn that 'the US will take human rights into account as we determine how to allocate our scarce resources for foreign assistance'. The Christopher speech, commemorating the 40th anniversary of the Africa-America Institute, was to have been the stage for announcing US recognition of the former Marxist government of Angola. That, however, was pre-empted by Mr Clinton earlier last week.  ANC leader Nelson Mandela ended a two-day visit to Natal province yesterday, urging an end to conflict between supporters of the ANC and the Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom party, Reuter reports. At least 8,000 people have been killed in clashes between the groups in Natal since 1986. Mr Mandela's plea came a day after at least 13 people were killed in clashes between ANC supporters, Inkatha hostel dwellers and police in Thokoza township, east of Johannesburg. The ANC and Inkatha both demanded a judicial inquest into the killings. Mr Mandela also said the date for the first all-race elections would be announced before the end of this month. The 26 parties to multi-party talks have already agreed the poll will take place no later than April next year and have been debating a precise date. ANC activists devised a plan to rescue Mr Mandela from Robben Island prison in 1981 in a basket dangling from a helicopter, but the attempt was called off by ANC leaders in exile because it was too risky, Reuter reports. Mr Mandela was freed in February 1990 after 27 years' detention.   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.     USZ  United States of America.

In an interview outside a small  rural church near the kwaZulu capital Ulundi, where he attended  a Good Friday service, the IFP president said if the summit went  ahead it would take place in a ""sour atmosphere"", following  Thursday's declaration of a state of emergency in Natal/kwaZulu.    There was uncertainty after the declaration whether the  meeting would go ahead but Mr Buthelezi indicated it appeared to  be on and said he held out hope ""otherwise I wouldn't be going"".  However, threats by Mr Mandela to confine the kwaZulu Police to  barracks and Mr de Klerk's ""appalling and shameful"" decision to  declare an emergency were not conducive to good negotiations, he  said.    The summit was to have taken place last week, but King  Zwelithini pulled out because of the killing of his subjects in  Johannesburg on Monday.    Mr Buthelezi said on Friday he had begun to doubt the state  president's integrity. While commending Mr de Klerk for his  reforms, he said ""the extent to which he has capitulated to the  ANC worries me"". ""I've begun to question his integrity. He's  disappointed me."" Mr de Klerk was supposed to make a decision  on an emergency from security information but instead he had  been compelled to do so by the Transitional Executive Council  [TEC], charged the IFP leader. ""For TEC, you must read ANC.""    Mr Buthelezi alleged Mr de Klerk was handling the situation  unfairly, because he had said nothing about the ANC's hidden  arms caches but was worried about Zulu traditional weapons. Mr  Buthelezi repeated that it was ""not normal"" for elections to be  held under a state of emergency.

From Reuters      CAPE TOWN, South Africa      South Africa's white minority government, announcing a major political  breakthrough, said today that it will hold its first official meeting with the  long-outlawed African National Congress on April 11.    President Frederik W. de Klerk said he will meet ANC leaders including Nelson  R. Mandela, the movement's newly appointed deputy president, whom he freed last  month after 27 years in prison for plotting to overthrow white rule.    The meeting is a first step toward negotiations on a new constitution to  enfranchise South Africa's black majority.    ""The state president, assisted by members of the Cabinet, will discuss with Mr.  Mandela and the ANC leaders from outside and from within the country the  obstacles perceived to obstruct the process toward negotiations,"" De Klerk said  in a statement.    Mandela is due back in South Africa on Saturday after a tour of African and  European countries that reunited him with ANC leaders exiled since the  guerrilla movement was banned in 1960.    De Klerk lifted the ban in February in one of a series of sweeping reforms of  four decades of apartheid race segregation.    Speaking in Stockholm, where he was visiting ailing ANC President Oliver Tambo,  Mandela said the meeting with the South African government will have to be more  than a formality if negotiations are to go ahead.    ""Our strategy is going to be that the very first meeting between the ANC and  the government must produce a result if we are going to continue talking,"" he  said in a radio interview.    Fears for the future of negotiations have been fueled by a wave of unrest which  has swept black townships and tribal homelands in the past month and cost more  than 200 lives.    Some of the worst violence has been in the 10 self-governing homelands created  under apartheid, where millions of blacks forced by Pretoria to give up South  African citizenship fear that they will miss out on De Klerk's promised  reforms.    Government officials say they cannot lift a 3-year-old state of emergency until  the unrest subsides. An end to the state of emergency is one of the ANC's key  conditions to negotiations.    Mandela and other anti-apartheid leaders have repeatedly called for an end to  the violence, and the need for black unity before negotiations began was a  major theme of Mandela's speeches at rallies in all four provinces after his  release.

0,FT932-6779 ,"FT932-6779 _AN-DE0B8ABFFT 930527   FT  27 MAY 93 / Mandela plea after radicals quit talks      By PATTI WALDMEIR      JOHANNESBURG   MR Nelson Mandela, president of the African National Congress, yesterday sought to maintain the momentum of the country's democracy negotiations after the ultra-radical Pan Africanist Congress said it was suspending participation in the talks. PAC President Clarence Makwethu announced the PAC would boycott constitutional negotiations until police released all members of the PAC and its armed wing, the Azanian People's Liberation Army, detained since Tuesday. Police said 73 people had been arrested, with 15 released yesterday. Mr Makwethu also called for the return of documents and computers seized in raids on PAC offices throughout South Africa. But Mr Mandela urged South Africans not to panic over the issue, saying: 'Since we began the negotiating process in 1990, we have had a number of problems. This is one of them. 'I'm sure that the democratic forces are strong enough to overcome this crisis.' The PAC's decision to boycott talks could make it difficult for the 26 negotiating parties to meet their self-imposed deadline of June 3 for agreement on a date for the first multi-racial elections. But on its own the PAC, believed to have only limited electoral support, cannot block progress. Controversy has arisen over the fact that the government's chief negotiator, Mr Roelf Meyer, was not informed about the arrests, which have come at a critical stage in the negotiating process. The PAC responded angrily to the arrests, saying it would act 'brutally and ruthlessly' against white South Africans unless police immediately freed their members. Government officials said racist rhetoric such as this prompted police to act against members of the PAC, whose followers have adopted the slogan 'one settler, one bullet'. Although the military strength of the PAC armed wing, APLA, is minimal, individuals claiming to be APLA members have carried out numerous murders of white farmers and holidaymakers in recent months, seriously damaging white morale. The PAC leadership has been ambivalent at best when asked to condemn such attacks. Police say they expect to charge many of those held for various crimes, including murder. Meanwhile, the ANC distanced itself from a demand made last weekend by Mr Mandela for the official voting age to be lowered to 14. Mr Mandela shocked politicians across South Africa's spectrum when he made the call in an apparent bid to win support from militant township youths.   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.

The people of Uganda, the statement says, are proud to have  been associated with the liberation struggle in South Africa  through their moral, political, and material support. The  statement adds that the people of Uganda salute president de  Klerk for his steadfastness and courage amid threats, not only  in organizing and ensuring free and fair elections but conceding  defeat in a statesmanlike manner and agreeing to hand over power  to the winner. We are deeply confident, the statement goes on,  that the new South Africa under the leadership of the  president-elect, Nelson Mandela, his ANC, and all other  peace-loving people in that country will erect an unshakeable  foundation on which peace, freedom, and unity will be built.  Uganda, the statement concludes, welcomes the new nation of  South Africa to its rightful place among the international  community and looks forward to many years of mutual and friendly  cooperation in all fields of common endeavor in order to make  the world a safer and more prosperous place to live in.

0,FT942-11079 ,"FT942-11079 _AN-EEHA5AAHFT 940507   FT  07 MAY 94 / Mandela creates cabinet for unity: Thabo Mbeki chosen as first deputy but finance ministry left unchanged as ANC fails to win two-thirds majority      By MICHAEL HOLMAN and MARK SUZMAN   Mr Nelson Mandela yesterday appointed South Africa's first government of national unity within hours of final figures confirming that his African National Congress had won 62.65 per cent of votes cast in last week's general election. Mr Thabo Mbeki, widely admired as a pragmatic politician and an experienced diplomat, was chosen as the country's first deputy president, making him the likely successor to the 75-year-old Mr Mandela. Mr F W de Klerk, the National party president, will be the second deputy president. And in a powerful message to the business community and to foreign investors, Mr Mandela said he would retain Mr Derek Keys, a member of the National party, in his post as finance minister, despite opposition from within the ANC. Speaking in Cape Town, a conciliatory Mr Mandela who will be installed as South Africa's first black president on Tuesday, acknowledged the need to reassure both business and the white community. 'We realise the importance of leaving the portfolio of finance as it is - without interference,' he said. The ANC emerged as overwhelming victor in the national vote, but fell short of the two-thirds of the popular vote it needed to write a constitution without the agreement of other parties. It also failed to win in KwaZulu Natal province, where the Inkatha Freedom party gained 50.32 per cent of the vote, and a one-seat majority in the 81-member provincial assembly. Inkatha's victory in Natal, which local ANC officials have blamed on fraud, will help counterbalance the ANC's power at national level. The ANC's victory was also tempered by failure to emerge as the largest party in the Western Cape, where the National party was the winner. However, Mr Mandela said he was relieved that his party's runaway win stopped short of the two-thirds majority 'because already tensions were building up that we were now going to write our own constitution.' The election was certified free and fair by the body charged with conducting the poll, the Independent Electoral Commission, despite widespread evidence of irregularities. Judge Johann Kriegler, IEC chairman, said the election had been 'flawed' but added: 'The heart of the matter is that we were able to establish the expressed will of the people with reasonable accuracy'. Nationally, the National party won 20.39 per cent of the vote, lower than expected but above the psychological threshold of 20 per cent needed to establish the party as a substantial force in the government. It is likely to have six ministers in the 27-member cabinet. Inkatha will have three. However, the crucial question of which cabinet portfolio would be allocated to Inkatha leader, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, remained unanswered last night. Most of the remaining cabinet posts are expected to be filled by members of the ANC although last week Mr Mandela hinted that he would include representatives of the radical Pan Africanist Congress, and the liberal, mainly white Democratic party which won 1.25 per cent and 1.73 per cent of the vote respectively. The choice of Mr Mbeki as first deputy president came after Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, the former trade union leader who played a vital role in last year's constitutional talks, declined a cabinet post. He had been tipped for the post but opted to work to strengthen the ANC as party general secretary.

CREDIT WHAT HE HAS  DONE, BUT THE STRUGGLE GOES ON.      By DESMOND M. TUTU, Desmond M. Tutu is the Anglican archbishop of Cape Town and  was the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize laureate.      CAPE TOWN      South Africa is standing on the threshold of a new era after the opening  address of the state president, Frederik W. de Klerk, to Parliament Friday.    Apartheid, the system of legalized racism introduced in the late 1940s, which  we have long condemned as being as evil as Nazism or Stalinist communism, has  outlasted even the repressive regimes of Eastern Europe dating from the same  era.    Now De Klerk faces the challenge that confronted the leaders of Eastern Europe  last year: He must move quickly to dismantle apartheid completely and allow the  emergence of government for the people, by the people.    De Klerk's speech has not met all the demands that the disenfranchised have  made of his government, but we must give him credit for those he has met.    Personally, I was astounded at some of his announcements and I am thrilled at  the confirmation that the South African government is committed to releasing  Nelson Mandela, the South African leader who has become a legend in his  lifetime.    When I and two other church leaders, Dr. Frank Chikane, general secretary of  the South African Council of Churches, and Dr. Allan Boesak, president of the  World Alliance of Reformed Churches, held discussions with De Klerk in Pretoria  last October, we called on him to take the following immediate steps:     -- Lift the nationwide state of emergency. He has not done this, although he  says he will ""as soon as circumstances justify it.""     -- Lift restriction orders imposed on political activists. He appears to have  gone a considerable way toward doing this.     -- Release all people detained without trial. He has not met this demand, but  has set a limit on the period of detention without trial.     -- Lift restrictions on the activities of political and other organizations.  He has done this, most importantly by unbanning the two longest-established  liberation movements, the African National Congress and the Pan Africanist  Congress.     -- Release all political prisoners. He has not done this, although he says  people jailed simply because organizations they supported were banned will be  released. He has, of course, released key ANC and PAC leaders, and we hope  Mandela will be free within days or weeks.     -- Grant reprieves for all those sentenced to death, and declare a moratorium  on the imposition of the death penalty. He has not met this demand, but has  suspended the imposition of the death penalty pending changes in the law that  can be expected to reduce the number of death sentences handed down by the  courts.    We also called on him to take various other steps within six months of that  meeting, only one of which he has met: the scrapping of the Separate Amenities  Act, which allows for the segregation of public facilities.    We said that, if he took all the steps we were urging, we would reconsider our  advocacy of sanctions. He has obviously not met them, but I nevertheless want  to discuss the sanctions issue further with political organizations, other  church leaders and the bishops of my church.    De Klerk now has implicitly recognized that apartheid has failed and that his  government has no legitimacy among the majority of the country's people.    This does not mean that our struggle is won. Far from it. Although De Klerk  talks about granting a universal franchise, he is still talking about ""minority  rights"" and volksregte (group rights), which implies that the white minority  will still have the power to veto government decisions.    Because of racism, members of the government have no true understanding of the  forces at work among most of the people in our country. Suspicion and mistrust  thus dominate their interaction with us.    In this situation, De Klerk may have enormous military power at his command.  But if we distinguish influence from power, Mandela wields more authority.    This is why it is imperative -- for stability and for orderly change in South  Africa -- that Mandela be released quickly, and released in circumstances in  which he retains both his credibility and authority, and can maintain a  negotiating relationship with the government.    Mandela holds the key to South Africa's future. In fact, for two reasons he has  a better chance of leading the country away from disaster than does De Klerk.    First, our country is fragmented and torn apart, and not just between black and  white. Even in the black community we fight each other. Mandela seems to have  the ability to relate to a very wide range of people without compromising the  most important parts of his own creed. He is perhaps the only hope we have for  uniting the disparate elements of those committed to real democracy.    Second, Mandela has demonstrated a capacity for letting whites know that there  is a place for them in the sun in South Africa, that despite all they have done  to us, our people ultimately are a forgiving people.

0,FT943-8232 ,"FT943-8232 _AN-EHRD3ADHFT 940818   FT  18 AUG 94 / Breaking the chains of freedom: Racial reconciliation is the most important legacy of Nelson Mandela's first 100 days in power      By PATTI WALDMEIR   It is a rare honeymoon that lasts 100 days, in politics or in life. The new South Africa has had its period of wonder and bliss; now South Africans are getting down to the really rather difficult business of life after apartheid. Later today, President Nelson Mandela will mark his 100th day in office with a speech to parliament outlining the achievements of his new government, and charting a path to future prosperity. The review of past achievements will, inevitably, be short; for the past 100 days have been far more notable for disasters averted, than for positive change. Scarcely three months after all-race elections hailed as a miracle worldwide, the euphoria which followed the poll has faded; but the new-found spirit of national unity, fostered almost single-handedly by President Mandela, remains strong. It is almost impossible to find anyone, white or black, with a bad word to say about Nelson Mandela. Rightwing leaders - even the hard-line Conservative party leader Ferdi Hartzenberg, whose party boycotted the poll  -vie to have their photos taken shaking the hand of the new president. Inkatha Freedom party head Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi is fulsome in his praise. And in spite of rumblings from a disaffected back-bench, South Africa's former rulers, the National party, remain eager junior members of the Mandela government. None of this seemed inevitable, or even likely, before the poll; and even the most conservative commentator has been quick to give credit to Mandela himself. Racial reconciliation is the most important legacy of his first 100 days; without it, there could be no progress in the hundreds more yet to come. But the first 100 days have also demonstrated that political stability is not enough. Democracy must also be made to pay: to provide housing, education, healthcare and jobs for the poor; foster the advancement of blacks in business as managers and as owners, and in the civil service; remove apartheid inequalities. Informal opinion polls - in the townships, on television and radio, and in offices of leading cities - show that most blacks believe their material lot has not improved since the elections. They also show that few blacks are surprised by this - and that most are willing to give Mandela time to deliver. Ordinary people are eager to excuse his lack of action: many explain, with pride, that their president is busy sorting out the problems of Rwanda; that he is shouldering the burden of the whole of Africa; that they trust him to deliver in the end. But political activists are not so patient, and will find it easier and easier to exploit township impatience. Simon Zondi, an African National Congress activist in KwaZulu Natal, says: 'People expected that as soon as the ANC takes over, they will see a change. But up to now that's not what's happened. To people's minds, the old (FW) de Klerk government is still in power.' Township activists such as Zondi, experienced at mobilising resistance around popular concerns such as lack of housing, are likely to give President Mandela a rough ride in the months and years to come. They will not act alone: Cyril Ramaphosa, ANC secretary general, has made clear that he sees himself as the conscience of the ANC. His future political career depends on mobilising disaffected ANC members behind him in his role as unofficial government watchdog; he has already launched his campaign with an attack on high parliamentary and government salaries. Mandela will have to deliver significant advancements in socio-economic development - and market them well - if he is to withstand this grassroots challenge. So far, change has been slow. In his state of the nation address soon after becoming president in May, Mandela promised that his first 100 days would bring free healthcare to every pregnant woman and child under six, and supplementary feeding schemes at every primary school. The launch of the latter has been delayed until September 1, and the former, though implemented, has caused considerable chaos in hospitals. And what is worse, it is understood that even these limited programmes are over budget, and that the president's office has been seeking donor funding to ensure they are maintained. This is an ominous sign for the future of the Reconstruction and Development Programme, the ambitious development plan which President Mandela is expected to detail in his speech to parliament today. For the president spent much of his first 100 days trying to persuade overseas and local investors that the RDP's goals could be achieved without increasing overall government spending; some R2.5bn is to be spent on the RDP in the current financial year, but all of it is to come from savings in other government departments. Unfortunately for Mandela, the markets showed little sign of believing his assurances on the subject of fiscal discipline (the news that Derek Keys, finance minister, is to resign from October, though for personal reasons, did not help). If there are now signs that RDP expenditure is straining the budget - coupled with fears of a revenue shortfall provoked by recently released gross domestic product growth figures showing that the 3 per cent economic expansion projected for this year may be difficult to achieve - then the new government's fiscal credibility could suffer further. But for the moment, President Mandela appears to feel he has spent enough time defending his credibility with potential investors, local businessmen, and whites in general. His speech is expected to reach out to his mass black constituency, to reassure them that the anti-apartheid struggle is about to begin paying off. But he will have to do more than simply announce a string of development targets, however laudable. He must take steps to overcome signs of paralysis in government: for the ongoing tussle between central government and provinces over the devolution of constitutional powers is severely hampering delivery under the RDP; a damaging row between national housing minister Joe Slovo and Tokyo Sexwale, provincial premier of the Pretoria-Witwatersrand-Vereeniging metropolis, over housing construction has not helped the government's public image; and the relative powerlessness of provincial government is also impeding progress towards the racial integration of local government, which will also bring many development benefits. Even more importantly, Mandela must demonstrate that he is ready to do more than simply exhort the economy to grow (as he did last week when he insisted he was not happy with a projected 2.5 per cent growth rate and preferred 5 per cent). He must reduce the cost of government itself, which as Mr Keys pointed out in a recent speech, consumes 21 per cent of national income, far above the 9 per cent spent on government in Japan and 10 per cent in South Korea. Yet all the pressures point towards increasingly costly government: under the constitution, Mandela cannot sack white civil servants, but he must promote blacks - leading to an inevitable expansion. And the new provincial governments will also increase the civil service burden. Mandela must also use his influence to foster an increase in labour productivity. According to figures compiled by Pretoria's National Productivity Institute, a quasi-government body, hourly manufacturing wages in South Africa, at Dollars 4.78 in 1993 dollars, rank just below wage rates in Singapore and South Korea, where productivity is far higher, and well above countries such as Malaysia (Dollars 1.80). So in the hundreds of days to come, Mandela must show that his government is capable of delivering an economic miracle to match the feats of political magic which stunned the world. For as ANC leaders constantly stress, the political kingdom is worthless without the economic development to make it habitable. The anti-apartheid struggle is finally over; but the economic battle has just begun.   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.   Industries:-  P9111 Executive Offices.

After meeting briefly yesterday the right-wing Freedom Alliance and the ANC said they would today consider their negotiating positions in a final attempt to amend the 1993 constitution to accommodate right-wing demands for regional autonomy. Full tripartite talks, including the government, would resume later in the week. There is no legal hurdle to further discussions, as under the electoral law, the last possible moment for agreement is still as much as three weeks away. The law states that parties must register for elections no more than 10 days after the planned April 27-29 election is officially promulgated. This has not yet been done, and promulgation could be as late as February 24. Inkatha and the white right will determine whether to register for elections on the basis of whether the constitution is amended to their liking. But negotiators from all sides said time was running out, with President F W de Klerk expected to proclaim the election this week to allow complicated preparations for the first all-race poll to begin. Right-wing parties also want a solution, knowing that, if they decide to enter the poll, they will have lost valuable campaign time. ANC negotiator Mr Joe Slovo said on radio he was pessimistic about a breakthrough in the three-month stalemate between the government, ANC and the Freedom Alliance, but 'while there's talk, there's life.' At the weekend, supporters of both Inkatha and white right Afrikaner Volksfront (Afrikaner People's Front) made clear their rejection of the poll, though neither party has yet made a final decision on participation. Mr Mandela reacted to weekend news of right-wing opposition by trying to reassure right-wing Afrikaners they can vote separately for their own homeland, a key demand from conservative Afrikaners. He made no such concession to Inkatha, which is demanding strong powers for regional governments, but called for peace between his supporters and those of Inkatha Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi. 'It is disturbing there are some people who want to kill every Zulu because they believe every Zulu is Inkatha,' Mr Mandela told a crowd of 10,000 in Ikageng township outside Potchefstroom, western Transvaal. ANC members should reason with their opponents, not kill them, he said.   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.   Industries:-  P8651 Political Organizations.   Types:-  NEWS  General News.

0,FT942-12079 ,"FT942-12079 _AN-EECCXAA5FT 940503   FT  03 MAY 94 / South African Elections: Mandela's cabinet choices will signpost way to future - The toughest appointment will be that of first deputy president, with the winner becoming Mandela's heir-apparent      By PATTI WALDMEIR   Everyone has known for months who will be South Africa's next president: Mr Nelson Mandela. So the betting classes have had to focus their wagers on the post of first deputy president, effectively the prime minister. Mr Mandela has so far given away no secrets on his intentions for this post, or for any other in the 27-minister cabinet. Before making these appointments he is required to consult the leaders of other parties represented in the planned government of national unity: all parties with more than 5 per cent of the vote are entitled to representation in proportion to their share of the national vote, and others may be invited in at his discretion. But the final decisions are his, and it seems unlikely he has made them yet. Indeed, ministerial horse-trading probably cannot begin until after the final electoral results are known and it would take a clairvoyant to know when that will be. Under the constitution, the National party (as the second largest) is guaranteed the post of second deputy president. This post will be filled by Mr FW de Klerk, the incumbent president. Beyond that the NP wants ministers in three broad categories: security, economy, and social affairs. And Mr Mandela seems inclined to cede powerful posts in each category. However, the odds are that these will not include the important post of minister of finance. Businessmen and international investors, who have pinned their hopes on the incumbent minister Mr Derek Keys continuing in office, will probably be disappointed. Mr Mandela's African National Congress sees the upliftment of black South Africans as the central mission of its 80-year liberation struggle; it is unlikely to put the main economic portfolio in the hands of a member of the outgoing government. While Mr Chris Stals, the central bank governor, will remain in office (Mr Mandela has guaranteed this), Mr Keys could be offered the post of minister of trade and industry. He previously indicated no interest in the job but may have reconsidered. Indeed, the Finance Ministry could turn out to be the linchpin of the whole cabinet structure. Once this post is filled it will determine other appointments for there is only one man in the ANC team who would make a remotely credible minister of finance - Mr Thabo Mbeki, the ANC's shadow foreign minister. Mr Mbeki is a class act, and the ANC has used him as a kind of unofficial ambassador to white South Africa. Businessmen breathe an almost audible sigh of relief when they know they have the urbane and charming Mr Mbeki to deal with. He has a masters degree in economics from Sussex University, although no background in finance. But he is well known internationally, and has the confidence to handle international negotiations well. Under the circumstances, Mr Mandela could probably make no better choice. The decision could have a significant long-term impact on the future of South Africa. For if Mr Mbeki was appointed finance minister he could not become first deputy president. The leading contender for that post then would be Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, ANC secretary general. The winner will become undisputed heir-apparent to Mr Mandela. It is a difficult choice, for both men are well qualified for the job. Mr Mbeki, 51, is older and more experienced. Mr Ramaphosa, 10 years his junior, has a ruthless political instinct which he used to win a constitutional deal which vastly favours the ANC. Few politicians can better him in battle. At the moment he looks the more likely choice, although only Mr Mandela knows for sure. The ANC leader must also find cabinet space for one of his closest advisers, Mr Joe Slovo, chairman of the South African Communist party, who could win a security port-folio. Mr Jay Naidoo, the union leader, could be made minister of reconstruction and development, a special economic post. National party ministers must also be catered for. Mr Mandela has said he would look favourably on Mr Kobie Coetsee, the incumbent justice minister and a hardliner whom the ANC leader came to know while still in jail, Mr Roelf Meyer, the National party's chief constitutional negotiator and a leading 'enlightened' nationalist, and Mr Pik Botha, the long-serving foreign minister. Far more difficult will be what to do with Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, leader of the Inkatha Freedom party, who could be made a third deputy president in the interests of national unity, and Gen Constand Viljoen, leader of the right-wing Freedom Front, whom Mr Mandela has said he would like to accommodate even if the front wins less than 5 per cent of the national vote. Bets can still be placed, but time is running out. By the end of this week, or early next, the die will be cast.  ----------------------------------------------------------                 WHAT THE VOTERS VOTED FOR               Government of National Unity  ---------------------------------------------------------- President               Elected by the National Assembly Deputy Presidents       One each nominated by the two                         parties with the most votes Cabinet                 Maximum of 27 ministers with                         places allocate proportionately                         from parties holding a minimum                         of 20 National Assembly seats  ---------------------------------------------------------- Parliament              The two houses also sit jointly as                         Constituent Assembly  ----------------------------------------------------------                 NATIONAL ASSEMBLY 400 SEATS  ---------------------------------------------------------- 200 members elected proportionately from national election lists, except in the case of the National party, which had no national list and will choose all its representatives from provincial lists  ---------------------------------------------------------- 200 members elected proportionately from provincial lists  ----------------------------------------------------------                      SENTATE OF 90 SEATS  ---------------------------------------------------------- 10 members nominated by each of the nine provincial legislatures  ----------------------------------------------------------                   PROVINCIAL LEGISLATURES   Elected proportionately from provincial election lists  ---------------------------------------------------------- 86 seats      Pretoria/Witwatersrand/Vereeniging (PVW) 30 seats      North-West 30 seats      Northern Cape 42 seats      Western Cape 40 seats      Northern Transvaal 30 seats      Eastern Transvaal 81 seats      KwaZulu/Natal 56 seats      Eastern Cape 30 seats      Orange Free State  ----------------------------------------------------------   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.

Mr Mandela, on a two-day visit to London, is due to hold talks today with Mr John Major, Britain's prime minister, and address members of both houses of parliament. The ANC expects the constitutional negotiations under way in South Africa will soon set a date for the country's first all-race elections, paving the way to a government of national unity. The election itself would follow within a year. Mr Mandela told a press conference that the ANC had 'issued an investment code which provides that there will be no expropriation of property of investors. They will be allowed to repatriate their dividends and profits, and we think that will go a long way to reassuring investors to invest in our country'. The ANC leader once again appealed to whites to stay in South Africa: 'They have the knowledge, the skills . . . without them it is going to be difficult to address many of the socio-economic problems facing the country.' An early foreign policy decision of a new government would be to rejoin the Commonwealth, Mr Mandela said later at a lunch in his honour hosted by Chief Emeka Anyaoku, Commonwealth secretary-general.

Here he is  speaking to Hassan Nze:    [Begin Bongo recording] What is significant is Mandela's  message, that he wants to rule with all the political parties.  It is this collegial power structure which Africa lacks. Each  time there is an election and a gesture is made towards the  losers, they say: We do not want to do this, we do want to do  that. I believe that in this instance Mandela is giving an  example. We must also congratulate de Klerk, who immediately  acknowledged Mandela's victory and accepted working with him in  the same government. Honestly, I wish that all Africans could  behave in the same way, that is to say, as though the country  belongs to everybody. We must understand that ruling  single-handedly, ruling without the opposition....[pauses] We  must understand that those who contest elections and expect  alternation must join the government, in order to learn how  things work, so that the day they become president things are  easier for them. I therefore believe that Mandela and de Klerk  have just given us -- both governors and opposition leaders -- a  lesson. Mandela chose to leave the past behind him and not  exclude whites, he did not seek revenge because he was the  oldest prisoner, he did not say that he would only govern with  his party and friends, he reached out to everyone.

By ELIZABETH MEHREN, TIMES STAFF WRITER      CAMBRIDGE, Mass.      The changes in her country have been ""tremendous,"" and in some ways quite  astonishing.    ""I began to feel I would never live to see the African National Congress  unbanned,"" said Nadine Gordimer, the novelist who has been called the  conscience of South Africa, on a recent visit here.    ""I thought I would never live to see (Nelson) Mandela and the other leaders out  of prison.""    Since adolescence Gordimer has been an outspoken foe of the white South African  government and its systematic repression of blacks, by far the majority of its  population. With an increasingly angry yet always eloquent voice, her seven  collections of short stories and 10 novels have scrupulously documented the  human side of her country's racial injustice.    If fellow South African novelist Alan Paton's works have given the world an  almost progressive view of the country, Gordimer's books have seethed rage. On  the subject of racial separation, Gordimer has no use for gentleness. Her most  recent novel, ""My Son's Story"" (published this month by Farrar, Straus &  Giroux), begins when the son of a ""colored"" activist discovers that his father  is seeing a white woman.    Gordimer read a short story, ""Home,"" to an audience of Harvard University  students on a recent visit here. When she finished reading, the audience sat,  immobilized. Her tale of racial tension had captivated them to the point of  silence. No one would speak.    ""I guess there's nothing else to say,"" Michael Blumenthal, chairman of the  school's creative writing program, finally said.    One day later, Gordimer sat in the living room of her old friend Harry Levin, a  retired professor of literature at Harvard. She is 66 years old, small and  delicate, almost birdlike, with hair that is perfectly white.    Gordimer is gracious, but keeps a cool distance. The daughter of a Lithuanian  immigrant watchmaker and his British wife, Gordimer exudes a sense of quiet  impatience. She has little time -- and less inclination -- for small talk.    For her, the urgency of South Africa cannot be underestimated. To that end, she  all but dismisses questions about literature and directs the discussion toward  politics.    She would concede that, at least on the surface, South African president F. W.  de Klerk has made strides toward racial justice.    ""He has gone farther than anyone else,"" Gordimer said. ""But people have to  understand that the basic underpinnings of apartheid are still there.""    As an example she cites the popular registration act, ""which says what color  you are when you born marks you for life. It's still there,"" Gordimer said.    ""The two acts that deprived blacks of their right to own land are still there,""  she said. ""Nominally, schools are supposed to be open to people of all colors  -- but this depends on the wishes of the majority of parents, so this is not  really open education to all.""    While many people outside South Africa laud the developments there, many, many  problems remain, she said. ""De Klerk reassures everyone in this country by  saying the end of apartheid is irreversible; it is here. But the ANC, people  like Mandela and me, say it is not irreversible.    ""It could be pegged at the level that it is now,"" she said. ""And that would not  be the end of apartheid.""    Imprisoned for 27 years, liberation leader Nelson Mandela was De Klerk's ""trump  card,"" Gordimer said. Mandela's release earlier this year was De Klerk's most  dramatic gesture toward black South Africa.    The event brought jubilation but also some concerns. With Mandela, Gordimer  said, ""of course there was always a question mark. After you have been in jail  for over 27 years, and are over 70 years old, there was a question if he would  be up to it all.""    As it happened, Mandela was up to it, ""and more."" Gordimer offered a slight  smile. ""One begins to wish that some other politicians could go to prison for  27 years, if they could turn out like that.""    For Mandela ""is not just intelligent and honest, he is -- and one doesn't use  this word very often -- he is a wise man,"" Gordimer said.    Mandela became an instant symbol of change and hope for South Africa. On a  visit to the United States in August, he was greeted with near-adulation.    But Gordimer cautioned that Mandela's ecstatic reception here must be viewed  with some cynicism.    ""The ticker tape is not enough,"" she said. ""That gets swept away the next  morning. The ANC needs strong financial support.""    Gordimer signed up as a member of Mandela's party, the African National  Congress, almost the moment that it was unbanned and recognized as an official  political organization in South Africa. It was the first political party she  had ever joined.    Gordimer gave another small smile. ""I'm happy to be a card-carrying member of  the ANC,"" she said.    She warns that progress toward racial equality in South Africa is also  threatened by right-wing opponents of the De Klerk government. ""At a  conservative estimate, 90% of the political base does not support De Klerk and  does not support constitutional debate, but does support the right-wing  breakaway party,"" she said.    For a time, ""it was easy to dismiss them as a bunch of cranks wanting to turn  back the clock,"" Gordimer said. ""But now we have to accept that they are  dangerous and have to be dealt with.""    The precariousness of the situation in South Africa is not widely understood  outside that country, Gordimer said. ""Somehow, the outside world expected that  once Mandela was out of jail, everything would be all right,"" she said.    ""But what power has Mandela got?"" Her voice rose in indignation. ""He hasn't  even got a vote! He is a world statesman and he hasn't got a vote. What an  extraordinary position.""    Not long ago, Mandela called Gordimer to seek advice about publishing his  autobiography. Their meeting spawned rumors that Gordimer would write it for  him.    The rumors are nonsense, she said. Beyond briefing him on the workings of the  publishing industry, she has no involvement in the writing of Mandela's  autobiography. ""I told him, 'you are a great statesman, but you don't know  anything about publishing.'    ""What could happen to you as a writer?"" she said she asked Mandela. ""You could  be banned, and I am three times banned. But no writer in South Africa was put  in prison"" for writing.    Three of Gordimer's own books have been banned in South Africa for as long as  12 years. In 1979, her novel ""Burger's Daughter"" was seized in South African  bookstores and blasted by the government as ""a full-scale attack against the  Republic.""    But since Gordimer has seen many of her political friends imprisoned or exiled,  the government's actions against her seemed relatively minor.    She shrugs at the notion that writing books that offend the Establishment is in  any way courageous. ""If I have had any courage -- and I am aware that it is  never enough -- it is for the way I have lived my life, and not for what I have  written,"" Gordimer said.    But her writing has served her in her political activism in South Africa. ""As I  became known through my writing, then I would always be asked political  questions,"" she said. ""I really felt it was my opportunity"" to speak out.    ""So many people were banned,"" Gordimer said. ""Blacks had no opportunity to  speak out. So I had a responsibility to speak out. I could not not have done  it. I could not have had any self-respect as a white person living there.""    Gordimer has also put her principles into action as a founder of the Congress  of South African Writers, which has about 5,000 members scattered around that  country, she said. COSAW is closely allied with the ANC and most of its members  are black.    ""We have tremendous problems because so many people who want to write, they  have the talent and the imagination, but are so poorly educated that they don't  have the words,"" Gordimer said. COSAW brings ""suitcase libraries"" to aspiring  black writers in the countryside. It offers encouragement and education, even  providing typewriters -- a luxury for many who would choose to write.    ""There's such a lot of talent among black writers in South Africa,"" Gordimer  said. ""But it is so hard to get them published.""    If there is any praise to be given, Gordimer said she will accept some  recognition for what she has done to help foster liberation in South Africa.    ""But not as a writer,"" she insisted. ""As a writer, I'm just doing what I know  how to do.""      Photo, Nadine Gordimer in a friend's Cambridge, Mass., home.

The move brought to 11 the number of people charged for  their  complicity in the military scandal in which two officers each  were indicted in February and April. Three other officers and  four civilians also have been arrested for their roles in the  scandal, which started to unfold after the mysterious death of  Naval Capt. Yin Ching-feng in December.    Investigators say Yin was killed because he threatened to  expose a pattern of bribery in which arms dealers and retired  military officers representing European companies paid  active-duty officers for help in winning weapons contracts.    The investigators have been helped in tracking down other  arms dealers and officers involved in the scandal by information  gleaned from classified Navy documents they uncovered during a  Christmas Eve raid on the home of Chang Chia-cheng, an arms  dealer and former Army colonel who has also been indicted.    The classified information, covering the six French-built  Lafayette frigates and the two Swordfish submarines the  Netherlands has constructed for Taiwan, was allegedly leaked by  active-duty officers. The two projects are part of the Navy's  military buildup.    In addition to Chang, who allegedly bribed officers to  obtain  the secrets, Liang Kang-hsien, who was suspected of leaking  military secrets before he retired as an Air Force major, and  Liu Shu, a retired Navy captain, have also been indicted. The  three could be sentenced to death if found guilty.    Four other people indicted by the prosecutor include Tien  Ching- wen and three arms dealers--Wu Yu-cheng, Li Hung-wei, and  Wu Pao- tai. They face a punishment of up to seven years in  jail if found guilty.     "

Acting President of the Republic Franca van  Dunem says the victory of Mandela and the ANC is also a victory  for the Angolan people.    [Begin Van Dunem recording] I am pleased that the ANC  struggle has culminated with its victory at the polls. I am  convinced that my sentiment is shared by the majority of  Angolans, who, for many years now, have rubbed shoulders with  South African nationalists, and have given their best to make  today's celebrations a reality throughout Africa. Likewise, the  efforts of Angolans over the past years, which culminated in the  ANC victory....[changes thought] I am convinced that the victory  of the ANC and the South African people in general will be  beneficial to developments throughout Africa. [end recording]  [passage omitted]    Prime Minister Marcolino Moco is pleased with the outcome of  the South African elections.    [Begin recording] [Moco] It is not an issue that only  affects  Angola. Obviously, Angola will benefit from the new situation  that has been created in southern Africa. I would like to  stress, however, that over the past years this process has  attracted the attention of the whole world, and Africa in  particular. It is not only a question of an ANC electoral  victory, but fundamentally a process of liberation and struggle  against racial segregation and of oppression of men by men. So,  I think the ANC victory is very good for us because the ANC  consists of our friends, who have fought by our side. I would  like to stress the major change that is taking place in the  world right now with the acknowledgment of all the victories the  South African people have scored in the past few years.    [Unidentified correspondent] As South African president,  will  Nelson Mandela ask to play a more important role in the Angolan  peace process?    [Moco] Any country involved in a process like this depends  fundamentally on its own people and on the capacity of its  politicians. That has been proven in South Africa. Like I said  earlier, with the completion of the liberation process and of  elections in South Africa, Nelson Mandela and his country will  know how to make a major contribution to Angola's progress,  including the peace process and development, because we are  aware that South Africa is a major economic power.    [Correspondent] But what about the ongoing Lusaka talks?    [Moco] Well, I think the Lusaka talks have made a great deal  of progress, despite a number of difficulties. What matters  with the South African experience is to specifically consolidate  the peace process in Angola and in southern Africa in general.  I think this will be a very useful experience.

A shoot-out between three  heavily armed German nationals and police near Pretoria in March  led to the dismantling of the plot to bring thousands of  neo-Nazi mercenaries into South Africa to kill Mandela and turn  the country into a bloodbath.    An estimated 2,500 of these mercenaries, who are paid 1,000  German marks (about 2,200) a week, are still in South Africa.    The assassination was to have been carried out with mortar  bombs fired from a hilltop near the Union Buildings and from the  south side of the building from a hill near the University of  South Africa while Mandela addressed the nation. Local  rightwingers and the German neo-Nazis also planned to set off a  powerful 500kg car-bomb in the Pretoria city centre and another  at Jan Smuts Airport on that day.    CITY PRESS was this week able to piece together the aborted  plot -- which has been kept under wraps by the authorities.  Police spokesman Captain Dave Harrington, however, confirmed  that police knew of the planned assassination but said it could  not be substantiated at the time. Harrington said police also  had information that rightwingers ""with bombs"" had been spotted  hiding in bushes on the hilltop near the Union Buildings on the  day of the President's inauguration -- but a police search  failed to find them.    The plot might very well have succeeded but for two things:    -- The revelation of heavily-armed German nationals in South  Africa after a shootout between two young police constables east  of Pretoria and three men in a car led to the wounding of both  constables, Juan van Schalkwyk and Danie Pretorius, and the  death of one of the mercenaries.    -- Women aligned to rightwingers involved in the plot  informed a SADF [South African Defense Force] Commando Unit,  which passed the information on to Military Intelligence and the  police.    The informants are also believed to have supplied the names  of rightwingers who were allegedly involved in the bomb blasts  that rocked the Reef shortly before the elections. It was this  information that led to the joint police and military forces  swoop on the bomb suspects, CITY PRESS was informed.    The three Germans involved in the shootout last March had  been keeping a low profile in Tierpoort when the two young  constables followed them. The three were travelling in a white  Opel Record car -- later found to be registered in a dead man's  name. They led the constables into a trap and opened fire on  them with AK-47s. The policemen's lives were saved by  bullet-proof vests but both were wounded, one seriously.    The body of the one of the Germans, Thomas Franz Kunst (32),  was later found in the bush with nightsight binoculars, an AK-47  with a silencer and 200 AK-47 rounds strapped to his body. Two  hours later a second German, Stephan Rays (26), was arrested in  the bush. Later a third suspect, Horst Klenz (57), was  arrested. Klenz, also known as Heinrich Siems and Kluger, is  wanted in Namibia in connection with the murders in 1989 of a  policeman and a security guard -- who were killed in a bomb  blast during the assisted escape of rightwingers Leonard  Veenendal and Darryl Stopforth from a Namibian prison.    CITY PRESS learned that after the information was received  from ""women"", police and military forces blockaded part of  Donkerhoek in Pretoria East last month, arrested several members  of the AWB [Afrikaner Resistance Movement] and other rightwing  groups in connection with the bomb blasts and recovered an arms  cache.    The police also raided a ""safe house"" used by German  neo-Nazis where they found a large quantity of arms and  explosives and documents relating to terror attacks.    Some of the would-be assassins are believed to have used the  Donkerhoek premises of Radio Pretoria for meetings.

The battle for freedom? The apartheid years? Does anyone remember?' There is an old Afrikaner ailment that seems to have reached epidemic proportions here in this most southern African land of rising hope. It is called Raubenheimer's disease. It was first noticed after the Boer war, when the British empire was nearly forced to its knees by the Boer guerrillas in the mist. This type of warfare was then exported to various skirmishes, from Afghanistan to Bosnia, with great success, while the British introduced the civilised world to their new concept: the concentration camp. After the Boer war, and while there was still great hatred and grumbling against the British, the Afrikaner found himself, by 1910, in a newly-formed union, blue-printed by the parliament in London and symbolised by the new South African flag: a compromise between those of the Cape Colony (Union flag) and the two ex-Boer republics (not the Union flag). The effect of this was to trap the Afrikaner in the centre of an orange, white and blue banner until the stroke of midnight before April 27 1994. Raubenheimer's disease was then spotted for the first time in a small dusty dorp on the wide plains of the Karoo, where Farmer Raubenheimer, having just lost his farm to fire and his family to famine, suddenly started speaking English and singing 'God Save the Queen'. He seemed to have forgotten completely the reason for the pain of his past. This - some people said - merciful amnesia made it possible for him to live side by side with his bloody enemy in peace. He even married again - a younger English girl - and they had three sons and called them after various recent British kings. Some of his bitter neighbours, however, swore that Farmer Raubenheimer had, in fact, lost his marbles. It is said that since then all Afrikaners have been born with a trace of Raubenheimer's disease. In decent company it was merely whispered that these strange bearded and braided volk knew how to adapt and not to die. 'Damn pragmatic' and 'bloody unbalanced' were more often used to explain the strange ways by which Afrikaners turned the other cheek and then whipped round, guns ablazing. We Afrikaners have always been great artists in absorbing - no, call it stealing. We would take something from another people, maybe a Dutch language, and unrecognisably beat it up to become Afrikaans. Or we would take a democratic Westminster system of government and bleed it dry of its truth. We even legitimised an inbred sense of racial madness, gave it an official Afrikaans name (that the English spelt apart-hate), wove it into our statute books 'democratically' and ended up in the smelly corner of the world's classroom with a skunk's tail pinned to our backs. But no more. Chalk has become cheese. The bad old days are gone. Mandela rules OK] Now, shockingly, it has become the time to be not anti but pro. One is proud of being a South African. Political satirists are jumping off roofs. Nostalgia-wracked anti-apartheid activists are ignoring the complexity of Bosnia and those political prisoners in Northern Ireland and are being treated for withdrawal symptoms. The black-and-white issues of Afrikanerdom's experiment in separate development have vanished. Like that flesh-eating streptococcus, Raubenheimer's disease has struck again. Here in this brand new South Africa it is impossible to find anyone more or less white and relatively sane who will admit to having supported apartheid. It is the same elsewhere, of course. In East Germany, after the Berlin Wall came down, there were suddenly no communists to be found, just as there had been no Nazis in Germany in 1945 (nor even, particularly, in Austria, Holland or France). No one recalls voting Margaret Thatcher into power all those years ago when British democracy still had a ring of authenticity to it. Some Afrikaners who swore bloody revenge on a democratically-elected, non-racial, non-sexist government are now swapping fond stories of election-day braais (barbecues) with their new non-white neighbours. Beers in hand, former terrorists and old fascists are comrades in arms; a cloudburst over a squatter camp is no longer the result of bad nationalist politics - only of bad weather. Amnesties and amnesias seem to go together. There are now more free men on the street (and in parliament) with blood on their hands than in the prisons. Politically-motivated crimes, ranging from mass murder to messy murder, have a cut-off date - if you blasted your enemies away before the cut-off, you are fine. During our past - until April 27 1994 - South African democracy was too good to share with just anyone. As a result, the world hated us. Now we are more of a democracy than Britain. Good news is no news and at the moment nearly everything here is good news, give or take a couple of killings that last year would have been called a political massacre; now it is just the criminal element. Everyone in government is united by salary and perks, from the old regime to the new extreme, from Chief Buthelezi to Winnie Mandela, the Black Evita, appointed not as minister of child welfare, which she had rehearsed for, but as deputy minister of culture. ('Culture?' she said. 'That's a funny post.' Please do not send her a biography of Madame Mao.) The world is still fascinated with South Africa, though no longer confronted by the nightly Munch-scream of black South Africa on the news; no longer turfing the Outspan orange into the toilet; no longer wearing the 'Free Mandela' T-shirt and feeling good for being so good. What now fascinates the world is this relatively well-educated, relatively civilised, relatively relatively pleasant group of white Christians (and Jews) who took the most beautiful country in the world and utterly and completely screwed it up - and nearly got away with it. And then turned round with a smile at the edge of the cliff and handed their only parachute to the former enemy. I thought I started with a question. Perhaps I had the answer. I really cannot remember. Call it Raubenheimer's disease. Pieter-Dirk Uys is a South African satirist   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.   Industries:-  P99   Nonclassifiable Establishments.

African Situation""]    [Text] Johannesburg, April 19 (XINHUA) -- The Inkatha  Freedom Party (IFP) decided today to participate in the April  26-28 elections in South Africa.    The decision was announced by South African President  Frederick Willem de Klerk in Pretoria today after talks among  himself, African National Congress (ANC) President Nelson  Mandela and IFP President Mangosuthu Buthelezi.    Observers here believe the IFP's decision to participate in  the poll is of great importance to the current situation in  South Africa.    The ruling National Party, ANC and IFP are the three largest  political parties in South Africa. It is estimated that the  three parties are able to obtain more than 85 percent votes in  the elections.    The IFP itself boasts of the support from the majority of  Zulus which are the biggest tribe among the black people in  South Africa. The IFP has a strong base within the Kwazulu  Homeland.    The IFP stood for the establishment of a federal or  con-federal state for future South Africa and therefore opposed  the 1993 interim constitution drafted by the multi-party  negttiations and adopted by the parliament.    The IFP registered for the elections early March, but later  asked for the postponement of the elections and refused to  submit its candidates for the elections.    Former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and six other  foreign mediators came to South Africa on April 12 in an attempt  to help solve the constitutional differences between the ANC and  IFP, but failed.    Supporters of the ANC and IFP clashed time and again since  1986, bringing the death toll to more than 10,000. The  violence has been escalating since the beginning of this year.  More than 300 people died of violence monthly.    De Klerk, Mandela and Buthelezi signed a memorandum of  agreement for reconciliation and peace today after their talks  in Pretoria.    The memorandum said the three parties ""reject violence and  will therefore do everything in their power to ensure free and  fair, elections throughout the Republic of South Africa.""    In a joint statement the three leaders appealed to their  followers and to all South Africans to end violence, to exercise  maximum restraint and to pursue their objectives by peaceful  means.    The IFP decision and the signing of the memorandum will  greatly reduce the violence raging in South Africa.    The Zulus, accounting for more than twenty percent of the  total South African people, are taking part in the elections.  This means a great change in the elections in South Africa.    Buthelezi said at a press conference today ""South Africans  may well have been saved from the disastrous consequences of  unimaginable proportions.""    Mandela said the memorandum of agreement is ""a leap forward""  for peace, reconcilation and an inclusive election process.""    ""IFP's participation in the poll deserves the support of all  leaders and of all those who love South Africa,"" Mandela stated.     "

The speculation is  as intense within the ANC as without.    As far as is known, final decisions have not yet been made  despite reports to the contrary. But the considerations at  stake are becoming clearer -- particularly in the key posts of  Deputy President, Finance Minister, Reconstruction and  Development and the security portfolios. It is not yet decided  whether the Reconstruction and Development post will be a  separate Cabinet position or be placed within the President's  department. Either way, it is obviously the surefire bet --  former COSATU [Congress of South African Trade Unions] general  secretary Jay Naidoo is unchallenged.    Constructing the new Cabinet is likely to be one of  Mandela's  loneliest tasks. Devising the candidates' lists was much easier  -- it having been a product of the popular will combined with  tinkering by the national executive and special interest  lobbying by the likes of COSATU, SANCO [South African National  Civics Organisation] and the SACP [South African Communist  Party]. Where the Cabinet is concerned, Mandela will (and  presumably has already been) pondering these issues with only  limited reference to many of his most senior colleagues since  they have a direct personal interest in the outcome.    Some insiders suggest that, to the extent that he consults  initially, he will do so informally with his closest friends --  mainly his old fellow inmates on Robben Island and primarily  Walter Sisulu who probably has no Cabinet ambitions of his own.  Eventually he will have to go to his National Executive  Committee, but that organ will be hard pressed to make objective  decisions.    The Deputy President post is a curious one. Some observers  see it as a straight contest between Cyril Ramaphosa and Thabo  Mbeki -- two of the contenders (likely PWV  [Pretoria-Witwatersrand-Vereeniging] premier Tokyo Sexwale being  the third) for Mandela's position when he retires. But it is  questionable whether the post is a significant one beyond that,  especially given that F.W. de Klerk will also probably be a  Deputy President. Unless, of course, the Deputy President is  also able to hold a senior Cabinet post.    Which brings us around to the most crucial post -- that of  Finance Minister. Will it be Derek Keys, and if not, then who?  First, there is no undertaking in the TEC's [Transitional  Executive Council] statement of policy to the IMF that Keys and  Reserve Bank Governor Chris Stals have been guaranteed their  posts in the government of national unity (as was suggested  yesterday by BEELD).    However, there is broad agreement in the ANC that Stals  should be reappointed when his present term expires in June.  The issue, quite simply, is investor and business confidence.  (There is some concern in parts of the ANC, though, at talk  that the deputy governorship may go to Bank of Beijing-trained  radical economist Vella Pillay, which would not enhance  confidence.) But it does go further, as reflected by a question  put this week by a senior ANC source: ""Do we need to keep both  Keys and Stals in place to maintain confidence, or is Stals  enough?""    There is genuine ANC concern about giving the key Finance  portfolio to an NP [National Party] member -- many would not  stand for it. While the incumbent may have to ensure financial  discipline, he should at least be committed in principle to the  RDP [Reconstruction and Development program], it is argued.  Even a senior NP source argued cogently this week that the post  should be held by the ANC. Keys, the argument goes, was able to  maintain financial discipline because he had the unstinting  support of De Klerk. Given the populist pressures the ANC will  face, the new Finance Minister should be someone with a  political base sufficiently sound to empower him (or her) to say  ""no"" to excessive claims on the Treasury by his colleagues.    The question is -- who fits this bill? It is widely accepted  that neither of the ANC's top two economics department figures  -- Trevor Manuel and Tito Mboweni -- have the stature in terms  of experience or political popularity. The two most likely  candidates, therefore, are Mbeki (tipped by the SUNDAY TIMES  some weeks ago) or Ramaphosa. Both have the necessary political  base, and some, though limited, economic and financial  expertise. But they would be surrounded by the bright young  officials who have advised ANC policymakers in the past four  years, and many of the incumbent Finance Ministry bureaucrats  trained latterly by Keys.    There are many other economics-linked posts which could be  occupied by Keys, Manuel, Mboweni and others -- such as Trade  and Industry, Public Enterprises, Mineral and Energy Affairs,  Agriculture, Transport, Manpower, Water and Forestry and so on.    This raises an international fact of life of  cabinet-building. As a Centre for Policy Studies analyst points  out, many appointments are made on the basis of political  favours owed rather than expertise in a portfolio or other  special qualities. There is no reason to think the ANC will be  any different. The key to avoiding chaos is to ensure that  senior departmental officials are capable. They then need only  ""to give the Minister a few papers to sign each day"" and to  focus their energies on running the show.    Mandela's position is made all the more difficult because  many of the top ANC candidates have no obvious administrative  skills in vital areas of government. Although Mbeki would be an  obvious candidate for Foreign Minister if he does not get  Finance -- and even if he makes Deputy President -- and Steve  Tshwete must be a sitter for the sport portfolio, who in the ANC  knows anything about how to administer transport, water affairs,  the environment and even education or health?    When it comes to handing out rewards for favours, Mandela  will have some leeway by virtue of the fact that he also has to  establish, in terms of the constitution, a public protector, a  human rights commission, and the restitution of land rights. In  his selection of Cabinet candidates, De Klerk is likely to be  swayed by the success of each region in the election. On this  criteria, and on the basis of seniority in the party, the most  likely candidates would therefore be Cape leader Dawie de  Villiers, Transvaal leaders Pik Botha and Roelf Meyer and  [Orange] Free State leader Kobie Coetsee along with Keys.    The portfolios Mandela may consider distributing to NP  candidates would be Agriculture to appease white farmers, and  Public Administration to quell the fears of the  Afrikaner-dominated public service. The DP's historical role as  parliamentary watchdog and its centrist position could well be  recognised by the appointment of party veteran Colin Eglin as  Speaker of Parliament.    The constitution provides for the appointment of a maximum  of  27 Cabinet Ministers, but it does not specify which portfolios  must be allocated to opposition members. Technically,  therefore, Mandela could make the four or so NP candidates  (assuming the NP gets 20 percent of the vote) ""Ministers without  portfolio"" but he is required to engage in a process of  non-binding consultation with other party leaders and make his  decisions ""in the spirit underlying the concept of a government  of national unity.""    Mandela is not constrained by the constitution on what  portfolios should be created. The ANC has already expressed its  desire to reintegrate the State Expenditure and Finance  departments. Other likely changes are a separation of the  Regional and Land Affairs portfolio in line with the increased  importance of regional government, and the creation of a Gender  Affairs Ministry. Whether Housing and Public Works should be  split is an open question and whether the current Public  Enterprises Department will keep its ""and Privatisation"" epithet  is a moot point.     "

After 10 hours of talks, Mr Mandela, leader of the African National Congress, emerged grim-faced to say that the two men had not been able to agree on an election date. The setting of a date, and the installation of a transitional executive to oversee government before elections, are preconditions for the lifting of international economic sanctions against South Africa. Mr Mandela had hoped to announce an election date when he visits the US next week with Mr F W de Klerk, the president. He said he believed a breakthrough on this issue could still be achieved in the 26-party constitutional talks, but this seemed unlikely without the agreement of Chief Buthelezi. Mr Mandela said the two men had made 'a great deal of progress' towards ending political violence between supporters of the ANC and of Chief Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom party. They said they would address joint peace rallies to persuade their supporters to cease fighting which has left over 15,000 people dead since 1984. In Natal province alone, 45 people died in the three days before the talks. Both also committed themselves to banning dangerous weapons at political rallies, a leading demand of the ANC. The trial of three right-wing whites accused of murdering South African Communist party leader Chris Hani was delayed yesterday to October 4, Reuter reports from Johannesburg. Mr Hani was shot outside his suburban Johannesburg home in April.   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.   Industries:-  P9199 General Government, NEC.     P8651 Political Organizations.

H. Kemp]    [Text] Pretoria March 11 SAPA -- The chairman of the  Independent Electoral Commission [IEC], Mr Justice Johann  Kriegler, flew to Mmabatho on Friday [11 March] night to ensure  that the Bophuthatswana government will co-operate fully with  the IEC. This follows two hours of talks between President F W  de Klerk and ANC President Nelson Mandela in Pretoria on the  Bophuthatswana crisis.    Mr Justice Kriegler will meet President Lucas Mangope to  obtain his assurance that free and fair elections will be  allowed in the territory. He will submit a report which will be  discussed by the management committee of the Transitional  Executive Council [TEC] on Saturday.    Mr Mandela, flanked by ANC Secretary General Cyril Ramaphosa  and SA Communist Party Chairman Joe Slovo, told journalists Mr  Mangope's statement on Friday in which he said he would  recommend to the Bophuthatswana parliament that the homeland  participate in the April election, was ""inadequate"". He said the  Transitional Executive Council had laid down four conditions  with which Bophuthatswana had to comply in order to normalise  the situation.    Besides committing itself to free and fair elections and  co-operating with the IEC, the TEC's resolution also demanded  that Mmabatho remove all restrictions on free political activity  and co-operate fully with the TEC regarding its reincorporation  into South Africa.    Asked whether Mr Mangope had effectively been restored to  power, the ANC president said information from both the South  African Defence Force [SADF] and the commander of the  Bophuthatswana Defence Force [BDF] indicated that Mr Mangope had  ""lost the loyalty and control over the security forces.    ""He has also lost control over the civil service and the  masses in Bophuthatswana. There is no government in  Bophuthatswana.""    Both Mr Mandela and Mr de Klerk said it was essential that  there should be full co-operation between the South African  Government and the TEC on stabilising the situation in  Bophuthatswana.    Mr de Klerk said the security situation had been brought  under control by the SADF, with the full co-operation of the BDF.    He said members of the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging  [Afrikaner Resistance Movement] had left the territory and a  group rallied by Afrikaner Volksfront [Afrikaner National Front]  leader Gen Constand Viljoen was also in the process of leaving.    Mr de Klerk said in terms of the TEC act, the governments of  each of the independent states would remain in office until the  election. referring to Bophuthatswana, he said: ""In less than  two months, that government will stop governing. It will then be  replaced by a new negotiated system. This is the last chapter of  an old imperfect system.""    He denied any agreement between himself and Mr Mandela that  Mr Mangope should be removed from office. Mr de Klerk said the  objective of Friday's negotiations was not to restore Mr Mangope  to power ""on the same basis as he held power yesterday"".    ""His statement today has changed that. He is now committed  to  participating in the election.""    Mr de Klerk said he believed Gen Viljoen had tried to ""play  a  constructive role to prevent an escalation of the violence and  restore law and order"".     "

Both came out in favor of  peace and of a peaceful channeling of the South African  electoral process.    [Correspondent Antonio Mateus] An election boycott poses a  potential conflict situation in South Africa. After meeting the  South African president, the ANC [African National Congress]  president, and the PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress] president,  Barroso still has reservations regarding the future of this  country. The consensus between the government and the ANC raises  hopes of a peaceful transition but this is not enough. Six  weeks away from the elections the objective is to extend  participation in the process. Barroso's message was echoed by  some of those involved, anxious to prevent the worst. Barroso  found today in Mandela an attentive listener to the Portuguese  experience of transition in Africa.    [Mandela, in English with superimposed Portuguese  translation] They have had a lot of experience regarding  the problems that South Africa will have to face, because the  former colonies, Angola and Mozambique, had difficult  experiences that we do not want to see repeated in this country.  I have found the exchange of opinion with him [Barroso] very  useful in that regard.    [Mateus, interviewing Barroso on the street] After the  brief contacts, are you more optimistic regarding the future of  this country, or is it too early to say?    [Barroso] I still have many reservations because I think  that  until we can ensure that everyone will participate there will be  the potential for destabilization. Essentially, I think there  is a great consensus in South Africa -- for which it would be  enough that the ANC and the National Party saw eye to eye -- but  it is important for that agreement to be as widespread as  possible in order to reduce to a minimum the potential for  destabilization of some forces.

In the process he may have  gotten this country to reflect on a painful subject -- racism here.    He saluted the lawmakers for signaling U.S. moral disapproval of apartheid and  driving home that important message with economic sanctions imposed at a time  when then-President Reagan was cozying up to South Africa's increasingly  oppressive white minority regime.    Mandela also praised the American philosophy of Thomas Jefferson for providing  a blueprint for a united, democratic and nonracial South Africa. Mandela said:  ""We could not have known of your Declaration of Independence and not elected to  join in the struggle to guarantee the people's life, liberty and pursuit of  happiness.""    On behalf of millions of black South Africans, who ""continue to bleed and  suffer,"" Mandela demanded the ballot without regard to race, color, creed or  sex.    On behalf of impoverished people who are denied the riches of their opulent  land, he envisioned a strong and growing economy that would provide food,  houses, education and health services in equitable measure.    On behalf of black children crippled by legal restrictions based on color, he  insisted on the transformation of a bitterly divided society ""into an oasis of  good race relations where the black shall to the white be sister and brother, a  fellow South African, an equal human being, both citizens of the world."" He  also envisioned a government founded on a democratic constitution, the rule of  law and a bill of rights enforced by an independent judiciary that would  guarantee freedom and justice for all.

In the process he may have  gotten this country to reflect on a painful subject -- racism here.    He saluted the lawmakers for signaling U.S. moral disapproval of apartheid and  driving home that important message with economic sanctions imposed at a time  when then-President Reagan was cozying up to South Africa's increasingly  oppressive white minority regime.    Mandela also praised the American philosophy of Thomas Jefferson for providing  a blueprint for a united, democratic and nonracial South Africa. Mandela said:  ""We could not have known of your Declaration of Independence and not elected to  join in the struggle to guarantee the people's life, liberty and pursuit of  happiness.""    On behalf of millions of black South Africans, who ""continue to bleed and  suffer,"" Mandela demanded the ballot without regard to race, color, creed or  sex.    On behalf of impoverished people who are denied the riches of their opulent  land, he envisioned a strong and growing economy that would provide food,  houses, education and health services in equitable measure.    On behalf of black children crippled by legal restrictions based on color, he  insisted on the transformation of a bitterly divided society ""into an oasis of  good race relations where the black shall to the white be sister and brother, a  fellow South African, an equal human being, both citizens of the world."" He  also envisioned a government founded on a democratic constitution, the rule of  law and a bill of rights enforced by an independent judiciary that would  guarantee freedom and justice for all.    Mandela's vision serves as a moral prod that could force this great nation to  focus renewed attention on its own problems. We have made so much progress, but  we have so much more to do to achieve a total victory over racism not just  abroad but at home as well.      Editorial    "

[Begin recording] [Rajmund Szwonder, Democratic Left  Alliance  senator] This case concerns a story that is about 10 years old,  isn't it? In my home town of Laskarzew, they say that reheated  pancakes are indigestible even when eaten with Russian caviar.    [Tadeusz Bednarek, Cenzin chairman] Cenzin sold weapons to  the United States, but they were museum pieces and weapons items  for collectors.    [Correspondent] What about reexports from what was then the  Soviet Union?    [Bednarek] There were instances of this kind, but these  exports, these shipments from Poland, went to credible, verified  end users in the recipient country.    [Correspondent] So what happened after that was up to the  recipient?    [Bednarek] Well, the supplier cannot check on this for a  long  time. A credible end user is necessary for the issue of an  export permit. Then you check whether the goods have reached  their destination. But we are unable to check what some  countries went on to do with the purchased weapons.    I would also like to emphasise that these were not  components, as the WASHINGTON POST suggests, of strategic  weapons, nor were they the latest technologies.    [Szwonder] The gun scandal [Polish officials found not  guilty  of alleged arms trade offenses by a U.S. court], of which to a  degree I was a hero, the Burmese scandal [U.S. ban on sale of  Polish helicopters to Burma], and the current scandal amazingly  coincide with our export successes, even if only minor ones.    [Bednarek] I believe that the publication in the WASHINGTON  POST and the whole press campaign around this subject is  unambiguously aimed at discrediting us in the eyes of our  Russian partner, who is Poland's number-one partner in special  equipment trade.

0,FT941-9496 ,"FT941-9496 _AN-EBODHABFFT 940215   FT  15 FEB 94 / Mandela warns of need for change: S African business community 'will have to rise to challenges'      By PATTI WALDMEIR   Mr Nelson Mandela, leader of the African National Congress and the man likely to be South Africa's next president, said yesterday he did not believe South African businessmen could be trusted to develop a post-apartheid economy without state intervention. In a tough speech to the International Press Institute, meeting in Cape Town, Mr Mandela criticised the South African media for being white-dominated, and implied this would have to change under an ANC government. The senior editorial personnel of South African newspapers 'are white, they are male, they are from a middle-class background . . . the principal players in the media have no knowledge of the life experience of the (black) majority,' he said. The economy as a whole remained minority-dominated, and this had to change. 'We are convinced that left to their own devices, the South African business community will not rise to the challenges facing us,' Mr Mandela told more than 400 international editors and publishers. 'The objective of our policies is to create employment as our highest priority. While the democratic state will maintain and develop the market, we envisage occasions when it will be necessary for it to intervene where growth and development require such intervention.' One example would be affirmative action programmes to promote blacks and women. The ANC recently published a detailed economic programme calling for selected state intervention in the economy, coupled with private investment. ANC policy has always fudged the issue of how much state intervention would be required to achieve the ANC's development goals. No clarity on this issue is likely before April's all-race elections.

About 75,000 people waited much of the day for the ANC  president at Miami Beach, a popular picnic resort at the dusty  Vaal Triangle township where police shot dead 69 protesters 34  years ago.    Just how much has changed in the intervening years was  demonstrated by the brazen display of weaponry, including AK-47  rifles, handguns, axes and assegais carried by rallygoers.  Sporadic gunfire was heard from time to time and stones were  thrown at people who refused to sit when the ANC president began  his address.    Earlier marshals battled to control the crowd as it thronged  forward to get a glimpse of Mr Mandela when he arrived. Nobody  appeared to be injured but several people fainted due to the  heat. There were anxious moments as mr mandela's motorcade  inched through the crowd.    Mr Mandela, thanking the crowd for their turnout, then  lashed  out at the ANC's organisers. ""I must condemn in the strongest  terms their lack of organisation and their inability to  anticipate the crowds.    ""It's lucky that nobody has died. I don't want to see this  again. If I see such a mess I will have to deal with the region  and the branch,"" he said.    At one stage, Mr Mandela stopped his address to remonstrate  with some ""ruffians"" and at another point he complained about  the rough manner in which marshals handled the crowd.    Mr Mandela, referring to the 1960 killings, said there would  never be a Sharpeville again.    He then turned to the election campaign, saying the ANC  wanted a better life for all. That included houses, education  and medical care. He said the ANC's opponents said the ANC was  being over-ambitious. What they meant by this, he said, was that  providing social services to blacks would be too costly. But the  ANC was determined to go ahead with its plans whether its  opponents liked it or not.    ""The National Party has never cared for the masses of this  country,"" he said.    Mr Mandela, referring to the interim Goldstone Commission  report concerning alleged gunrunning said to involve senior  policemen, he said there were good policemen in the force and  good soldiers in the South African Defence Force.    He then led the crowd through the voting procedure, telling  them they must look for his face on the ballot paper and put  their cross alongside that face.    The roads of Sharpeville were crowded with buses taking  supporters home when the rally finished. Sporadic gunfire  punctuated the din.    Earlier, Pan Africanist Congress [PAC] President Clarence  Makwetu addressed about 3,000 people at the George Thabe stadium  about three kilometres away. Mr Makwetu said the ANC had not  wanted to become involved when the PAC launched the pass  protests that led to the Sharpeville killings.    He said only the PAC had stuck to its principles and only  the  PAC could ensure real liberation. The PAC's rhetoric at the  rally, complete with ""one settler, one bullet"", was more  militant than the ANC version. But the gathering itself was  quieter.     "

Nor did the  lack of security surrounding the country's next head of state.""  ""Tight security will keep him further from the people than he  would like, but it is an inevitable feature of a world in which  presidents are no safer than prime ministers, princes or popes.  And when he finds it irksome, Mandela can remind himself that  his job is to protect this country's assets. He features too  high on that list to go dancing in the streets, no matter how  jubilant he feels.""

SOWETAN also praises President de Klerk ""for  the role he has played in this drama. It was De Klerk's courage  that eventually led to the events of this day. It was a courage  in the face of hate and abuse from his own people and his act on  February 2 1990 will be recorded by history as the turning point  towards a democratic majority government in South Africa.""  SOWETAN also notes Inkatha leader Buthelezi's ""undeniable""  ""control on his people and area."" Buthelezi has received  sufficient votes ""to show he has a place in the hearts of the  people of South Africa.""

Mr Mandela, whose African National Congress will be formally installed as majority party at the opening of the new national assembly this morning, stressed over the weekend what is likely to become the dominant theme of his presidency, calling for reconciliation between all races. Meanwhile, outgoing President FW de Klerk continued to juggle with his selection of candidates for the six cabinet posts allocated his defeated National party, at the same time pursuing efforts to secure one of the security portfolios, both of which have been claimed by the ANC. The new government also encountered its first public relations setback when it was disclosed that Mr Mandela, who has been calling for cuts in political salaries, will receive R575,000 (Pounds 107,000) a year before allowances, well above the rate for most western heads of state and considerably more than Mr de Klerk's current salary of R266,000. The figure was fixed by a committee established by the outgoing government. After the parliamentary session, Mr Mandela will travel to Pretoria tonight and will be formally sworn in as president tomorrow morning. More than 180 world leaders, including more than 40 heads of state, are arriving in the country for the inauguration and the overworked organising committee is frantically trying to ensure adequate security precautions and sort out last-minute logistical problems for the ceremony, which will be attended by more than 150,000 people. Confidence in South Africa's ability to handle an exercise of this kind has been shaken by the ineptitude shown in the organising of the elections themselves. Speaking to a cheering crowd at a Christian thanksgiving service led by Archbishop Desmond Tutu at a stadium outside Johannesburg yesterday, Mr Mandela stressed the need for everyone to carry through the peaceful spirit of the election period. 'It is time for all South Africans to remember they are one people,' he said. Yesterday's rally was the culmination to a weekend in which Mr Mandela addressed all the country's main religious groupings, attending a synagogue and mosque in Cape Town on Saturday. Although the ANC announced its list of cabinet ministers on Friday, continuing the pragmatic approach displayed by all political leaders during the election process, Mr Mandela suggested over the weekend that some reshuffling might still occur. The National party is known to be particularly unhappy that both the defence and law and order ministries have been allocated to ANC officials. Under the new constitution all parties receiving more than 5 per cent of the national vote are entitled to representation in the cabinet. The government will comprise 18 cabinet ministers from the ANC, six from the National party and three from Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom party. Neither the NP nor Inkatha has yet announced its cabinet choices, but the incumbent finance minister, Mr Derek Keys, will keep his job, a move intended to reassure both the international community and the local business sector that no radical economic policies are intended. It is not yet known what portfolios will be offered to Chief Buthelezi, nor whether he himself will accept a post. The new parliament will sit for five years during which it will serve as legislative assembly and, in conjunction with the senate, draw up a final constitution. Membership of the senate, which will have 90 members, 10 from each region, has not yet been finalised. It is expected to meet for the first time later in the week. Meanwhile, eight of the country's nine new regional parliaments were sworn in over the weekend and the new provincial premiers elected. The ANC assumed control of seven of the legislatures while the National party, led by the outgoing minister of law and order Mr Hernus Kriel, was installed at the head of the Western Cape. Because of the slow pace of vote counting in the province, the parliament of KwaZulu/Natal, where Inkatha will have a wafer-thin majority, will only be sworn in on Wednesday.

Whereas it  was expected that the Friday [18 March] session would deal with  documentary testimony and the examination of all the written  evidence in the investigators' file, two different testimonies  shocked the courtroom. These concerned serious threats against  direct or indirect participants in this trial, connected with  the further course of the judgement of Fatos Nano. In a  strongly worded protest, Prosecutor Arben Qeleshi publicly  confirmed the existence of a violent threat against the husband  of expert witness Virgjeresha Shkreli, threatening him with  physical liquidation if his wife were to testify against Nano at  the trial. Immediately after this, Nano's lawyer Perparim  Sanxhaku made public another fact. According to him, a  now-identified individual had threatened him because he is the  Socialist leader's defense lawyer.    ""On the afternoon of 17 March, certain people whom the  police  and justice authorities have still not identified used physical  and psychological pressure in the most unscrupulous and inhuman  fashion against the husband of the expert witness Virgjeresha  Shkreli,"" Prosecutor Qeleshi declared in his protest, ""to the  point of pointing a loaded pistol into his mouth and saying  that, if his wife appeared in court, we will physically  eliminate you and hang you."" Before the file on the aid scandal  was sent to the court, the expert witness Shkreli and her two  colleagues had worked on calculating the amount of Italian aid  lost, which the prosecutor has claimed were appropriated and  misused. However, according to court rules, the work of the  experts attached to the investigation must also be examined in  court in the final stages of the judicial procedure.    Only a few moments after Prosecutor Qeleshi's protest, the  lawyer Sanxhaku reported another serious threat, this time  against himself. ""At 1730 on 15 March, an identified person  driving a car with the license plate TR 2651 A threatened me  personally,"" Sanxhaku declared, ""saying that they would hang me  from a rope."" Thus, two very special pieces of evidence have  come to light, joining Prosecutor Qeleshi's statement a few days  before the start of the trial that he too had been personally  threatened.     "
0,FT924-15865 ,"FT924-15865 _AN-CJBCAAA5FT 921002   FT  02 OCT 92 / Bombay Securities Scandal: Economy emerges largely unscathed      By STEFAN WAGSTYL   THE 43 per cent drop in the Bombay stock market after the scandal erupted in April prompted concern that the affair might damage the economy as a whole and deflect the government from its aim of opening and deregulating the economy. But the market's subsequent recovery is a sign that the impact may not be as bad as expected: Indian investors seem to believe the government will weather this storm and not be diverted from the road of reform. Opposition politicians who had hoped to use the affair to embarrass the government have so far had only modest success. Mr P Chidambaram, the commerce minister, is the only minister to have resigned over the affair. The decision of Mr Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, to establish a joint parliamentary committee to examine the scandal has created a useful political lightning rod. It will also win time, since the committee may not complete its work until next summer. Nevertheless, the scandal's impact on the economy and on the economic reform programme is not negligible. Mr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister, has just returned from a visit to the UK and the US, where investors told him that the scandal has highlighted the risks of investing in India, especially in financial instruments. Indian investors too are worried. Mr N Sankar, president of the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India, said this week: 'The scam and the unprecedented closure of stock exchanges for long periods have shaken the confidence of the investing public.' Such concerns may prove short-lived if underlying market conditions are attractive enough to persuade investors to set aside scandal-generated fears. However, delays in investment of even a few months could slow growth and harm public faith in the economic reform programme. Although the government had approved some Dollars 600m (Pounds 350m) of foreign investment plans by the end of March, little of this money has in fact been invested. The scandal has made banks wary of infringing Reserve Bank of India guidelines. Sticking to the letter of the law has squeezed the supply of bank credit, which was already tight because of the central bank's efforts to restrict the money supply to slow inflation. Mr F A Mehta, a director of Tata Sons, the controlling company of the Tata industrial group, says: 'The scam has not started the squeeze on credit but it has aggravated it.' Indian officials say the best way to restore confidence is to take prompt action to punish offenders and implement specific reforms. The authorities have shown their resolve by pillorying suspects such as Mr Harshad Mehta, who spent 111 days being interrogated in custody before release on bail last week. The Reserve Bank of India has reminded banks to abide by the rules in the inter-bank market, including a ban on paying cheques payable to a bank into the account of a third party, such as a broker - one of the abuses which surfaced in the scandal. The central bank has also started a more wide-ranging study of bank management practices - including standards for book-keeping. The authorities want to put the scandal behind them. As Mr Salman Khurshid, junior minister for commerce, puts it: 'The scandal had to happen, and now that it has, we believe the economy will emerge the stronger for it.' That may be too much to hope for. But neither, it seems, will the affair leave the economy significantly weaker.  The Financial Times   London Page 6  "

HE IS  SOUTHEAST ASIA'S ANSWER TO JIM BAKKER.      By CHARLES P. WALLACE, TIMES STAFF WRITER      BANGKOK, Thailand      Like a faint echo of the Jim Bakker story in the United States, the Thai news  media have been held spellbound for the past month by a sex scandal involving a  prominent Buddhist monk.    The scandal has been front-page news since the monk, Phra Nikorn Dhammavadi,  the abbot of a temple in the northern city of Chiang Mai, complained to the  police that he was forced to pay $200,000 to a woman in an extortion case.    The woman, Ornpraweena Bootkhuntong, a 23-year-old law student, caused a  sensation when she replied that she was four months pregnant and that the monk  was the father of her child.    Like their Roman Catholic counterparts, Buddhist monks take vows of celibacy  and poverty. Thus, Phra Nikorn, one of the most revered spiritual leaders of  northern Thailand, stood doubly under suspicion: He was accused of breaking his  celibacy vow -- a charge he vehemently denied -- and disturbing questions were  raised about how the supposedly impoverished head of a monastery could have  enough money to nevertheless pay off the lady involved.    ""It is important to ask how a monk, who according to the vinaya (monastic code)  cannot even touch money, let alone own it, could write a check for as much as 5  million baht ($200,000) to pay off what he calls blackmail,"" a Buddhist  scholar, Suewanna Satha-anand, said in one newspaper.    The monk scandal not only has an obvious titillation factor, but it is causing  many Thais to reflect on the moral values of their society as it changes from a  largely agrarian country to an industrial power.    As Sanitsuda Ekachai of the Bangkok Post observed, the revelations about the  monk just added ""to the slow erosion of their image as the spiritual leaders of  society.""    While Thailand may be known abroad as a place for tourists to come and cavort  licentiously, it has remained a paradoxically conservative society where  Playboy magazines are not widely available for sale and films are heavily  censored.    More than 95% of the population are followers of Buddhism, a fact that helps  define Thai society. It is still common to see people offering a wai -- a  hands-pressed obeisance -- as they pass in front of a Buddhist shrine, even  while driving a car.    In the past, it was not uncommon for young men of high-school age to become  Buddhist monks for several months as part of the family's effort at merit  making, a key Buddhist precept. The monks in their saffron robes can be seen  wandering in towns and cities seeking alms, such as gifts of food. But  recruiting of young monks has reportedly fallen off as graduates compete for  high-paying jobs and the good life of young urban professionals.    The Phra Nikorn scandal is the second major Buddhist scandal in a year. Several  months ago, the Buddhist hierarchy defrocked a highly popular monk who, like  Protestant Reformation leader Martin Luther, established a sect that rejected  the increasing wealth and worldly ways of the clergy. News accounts uncovered  an increasingly affluent lifestyle even for those who had adopted the ascetic  life, including one monastery equipped with walkie-talkies.    Once the dam burst over Phra Nikorn, the Thai-language press began printing  evidence of his misdeeds. One photo showed him in white pajamas in a wedding  ceremony with Ornpraweena, which for sheer shock value was the equivalent of a  picture of a Roman Catholic cardinal tying the knot in a Las Vegas wedding  chapel.    In answer to Phra Nikorn's plea that he hardly knew the girl, the newspapers  published photos of the two on vacation in various spots abroad, including the  United States, which indicated the relationship had been long term and  intimate.    Perhaps most damaging of all, the press began focusing on the wealth  accumulated by abbots such as Phra Nikorn, showing them driving about Bangkok  in chauffeur-driven Mercedes-Benz limousines. In the traditional system under  which monasteries operate, the abbot can use public donations in any manner he  wants. According to recent newspaper articles, it has opened the system to  abuse, particularly from young women seeking riches.    While Thailand has experienced one of the highest rates of industrial growth in  the world over the last five years, the wealth has not been distributed evenly.  There are many new Thai millionaires, but at the same time the working class in  Bangkok complains vocally about being less and less able to afford life in the  industrial metropolis.    Seeing their avowedly poverty-stricken clergy living like millionaires has  clearly deeply offended many Buddhists.    ""Now, if you see a man wearing saffron (the colors of a monk's robes), you  can't assume that he is a monk,"" said the mass-market Thai Rath newspaper. ""It  needs a lot of consideration.

The US Senate later approved legislation lifting US sanctions and Canada and the Commonwealth indicated that they would follow suit. Addressing a specially convened meeting in New York of the United Nations Special Committee Against Apartheid, which has spearheaded the sanctions drive over the past three decades, Mr Mandela asked governments 'to take all necessary measures to end the economic sanctions you imposed'. Mr Mandela, leader of the African National Congress, called on the international investment community to 'help regenerate the South African economy', offering a gloomy assessment of a country 'threatened by a process of disintegration'. He said steps should be taken to prevent South Africa sliding towards another Somalia or Bosnia. Sanctions had brought South Africa to the point 'where the transition to democracy has now been enshrined in the law of our country'. Parliament passed legislation on Thursday creating a multiracial Transitional Executive Council which gives blacks a say in central government for the first time. The passage of the legislation has been welcomed by President Bill Clinton as a 'historic step'. He said the US would launch 'initiatives to help restore economic growth' to South Africa. These include supporting South Africa's renewed access to the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. Mr Mandela's call comes at the beginning of a crucial 10-day period for the country in which senior officials of both government and the ANC will be seeking to convince investors and donors that they should invest in South Africa. South African government officials and ANC representatives will attend the annual meetings of the IMF and World Bank. Next week will also see two important South African investment conferences in New York and Washington DC.

He added  that appropriate research and development (R  D) will have  to  become one of our weapons in the fight against poverty and  inequality.    Dr. Ngubane gave a few pointers on how he saw issues of  policy:    South Africa as a developing society, should ideally spend  more    than the current roughly one per cent of GDP on research and    development    The state should shoulder a substantial part of this    expenditure, but also encourage the private sector to become    increasingly involved.    South Africa's base of scientists will have to be broadened,    especially at the historically black universities and  technikons    Affirmative action in the research field should not take the    form of symbolic appointments. It must be based on  empowerment    through training and human resource development.    Dr. Ngubane acknowledged that there are no easy answers.  Therefore he could be expected to move cautiously after having  studied each issue in all its ramifications.     "

Meeting at Tuynhuys from about 11AM until  well into the evening, the cabinet did not allow the land  transfer issue to develop into a controversy that could detract  from Mr Mandela's address.    A statement issued by Deputy Presidents Thabo Mbeki and F W  de Klerk said cabinet approached the discussion ""with a view to  reaching a consensus that will contribute to the process of  nation-building and reconciliation"". The statement said all the  parties reaffirmed their commitment to such an approach.    A cabinet committee was formed comprising Land Affairs  Minister Derek Hanekom and Ministers Kader Asmal, Roelf Meyer  and Ben Ngubane.    Both Mr Meyer and Dr Ngubane were central to the  constitutional negotiations process which formed the political  background to the passage of the Ingonyama [King's] Trust Act.  The legislation ceded 1.2 million hectares of communal land to  Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini.    The committee will report on the background and reasons for  the establishment of the trust, examine and report on the  implications of the act and make recommendations to the cabinet.  It will pay attention to security of tenure of residents in the  prescribed area, the functioning of a land claims court should  disputes arise, and the impact on a future land reform programme.    The land issue was discussed in cabinet following a meeting  between President Mandela and Home Affairs Minister Mangosuthu  Buthelezi. After the meeting, Chief Buthelezi denied that the  land transfer had anything to do with securing his Inkatha  Freedom Party's participation in the elections in April.    However, the issue was resolved in less than two hours as  cabinet members turned their attention to Tuesday's opening of  Parliament and in particular Mr Mandela's speech to the nation.  Mr Mandela's speech is expected to set out his vision of how the  government of national unity will address South Africa's  political and socio-economic challenges in its five years of  existence.    Mr Mandela will speak after a ceremonial drive through  central Cape Town along streets lined with troops. There will be  a flypast and a 21-gun salute as he takes the salute from the  guard of honour.    Parliamentary staff were making last-minute preparations for  the opening and getting the historic house of Parliament into  shape for the event.    Cabinet colleagues apparently discussed aspects of Mr  Mandela's speech at length and made inputs.    Mr Mandela's staff were not giving away many clues, but he  is  expected to once again stress the importance of reconciliation.  ""Reconciliation is important where there is a lot of  uncertainty,"" said a source close to the president's office.    ""Our approach in general terms is that reconciliation and  social upliftment go together. We can never have true  reconciliation if the conditions of the people remain the same.""    The source said Mr Mandela's speech would deal with the main  themes of the Reconstruction and Development Programme. Mr  Mandela would point to the need to make certain immediate  changes. These could involve the education system and a job  creation programme.    Mr Mandela will also be seeking to reassure potential  foreign  investors that strict fiscal discipline will be maintained in  the government's approach to reconstruction and development.     "

While noting that President  Mandela has defused the crisis ""for the time being,"" the  editorial claims that ""disquieting questions remain. The  transfer has the hallmarks of a furtive pact and political  chicanery....Suspicions linger that Buthelezi was preparing a  fall-back position in case the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] lost  the provincial election in KwaZulu/Natal. By transferring land  held by the KwaZulu Government to Zwelithini, he seems to have  been securing an alternative IFP base.""    Mandela's Speech -- In another editorial on the same page,  THE STAR describes President Nelson Mandela's speech to  Parliament on 24 May as ""romantic"" and ""wonderfully unifying.""  ""It charted a possible course for the country which would  constitute a `high road' in anybody's terms. Stripped to its  essence, the president's message is that the middle classes of  this country will not only be allowed to continue in their  productive endeavours, but will be actively encouraged to do so  by the new Government -- on condition that there is full  acceptance of the urgent need for the upliftment of the  poverty-striken and disadvantaged."" Noting that the ANC's  Reconstruction and Development Program has been endorsed by all  major role-players in South Africa, the editorial concludes: ""In  a programme of sensible, achievable reconstruction and  development lies the future of all of us; if it fails, so will  we.""    BUSINESS DAY    Mandela's Speech -- Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY also looks at  President Mandela's speech in its editorial on page 10 of its 25  May issue. The paper says Mandela presented ""an inspired,  positive, and attainable vision of the future that together we  can create....His vision of our country's future displays an  idealism for which we all should strive."" The editorial  continues: ""We believe in Mandela's sincerity and in his  commitment to what he says....We trust the sincerity and  commitment of the party Mandela leads....While we would have  preferred specific commitments on issues such as the free flow  of money and people in and out of the country, we trust the  commitment to dealing with them sensitively once more pressing  issues have been addressed."" The paper notes that Mandela's  speech recognized the need to reconcile the concerns of  investors and bankers with the demand that ""economic and social  inequalities...be rectified quickly."" The editorial concludes:  ""The future will not be easy, and attaining the future  envisioned by Mandela implies commitment from everyone. We  cannot choose but to remain on the road we have taken. Along it  we can together create the great society.""    SOWETAN    Gun Control -- Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on May 25  publishes on page 10 an editorial that notes efforts being made  in the Pretoria, Witwatersrand, and Vereeniging provisional  parliament to strengthen gun control by revising licensing  procedures. ""In general, we will support any effort to impose  gun control on a paranoid society which is `armed to the  teeth.'...While limitations on gun licensing is a step in the  right direction, a comprehensive plan is needed to make the  country relatively gun free."" The paper urges that such a plan  take into account the need to improve policing so that citizens  will not feel the need to own a gun, the need to stop  individuals in government agencies from dealing illegally in  guns, and the need to stop the flow of guns from Mozambique and  other neighboring countries.

0,FT943-764 ,"FT943-764 _AN-EI1EIAAUFT 940928   FT  28 SEP 94 / Inkatha intends to sue Mandela over killings      By MARK SUZMAN      JOHANNESBURG   South Africa's Inkatha Freedom Party said yesterday it intends to sue President Nelson Mandela, his African National Congress party and the South African police for R8m (Pounds 2.2m) damages, following the killing of eight IFP supporters outside the ANC headquarters in Johannesburg last March. Announcing the lawsuits, Mr Themba Khoza, IFP political director, said summonses had been served on Mr Mandela and Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, ANC secretary-general, for allegedly obstructing a police investigation into the incident. Summonses had also been served on Mr Sydney Mufamadi, safety and security minister, and General Koos Calitz, regional commissioner of police, for alleged inadequate protection of the marchers. The decision marks a new deterioration in relations between the ANC and Inkatha, partners with the National Party in the ruling National Unity government. Before the April election, ANC and Inkatha supporters were frequently involved in clashes; in recent months they have been embroiled in disputes within the KwaZulu/Natal provincial government. Inkatha has for several months been demanding a full investigation into the killings, which occurred when a crowd of its supporters were apparently fired on by ANC security guards during a political demonstration. The timing of the announcement seems designed to deflect attention from the controversy surrounding Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, Inkatha party leader and home affairs minister. On Sunday night, the chief and a group of bodyguards interrupted a live broadcast by Prince Sifiso Zulu, a political rival instrumental in persuading the Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini to break off relations with Chief Buthelezi last week. Chief Buthelezi has since apologised for the incident, saying he was not aware the television programme was still on the air, but his actions have been widely condemned, and Prince Sifiso Zulu has said he will press charges against the chief. The ANC has released a statement critical of Chief Buthelezi. President Mandela will not make a statement until he has discussed the issue with the cabinet today.

The president was  addressing a crowd which gathered at the parliamentary buildings  in Kampala today to celebrate the end of apartheid in South  Africa. Mr. Museveni said that it is a great achievement to see  that this sad chapter in human history has come to an end. He  also congratulated Mr. de Klerk for changing his mind from his  original stand and join the people of South Africa in the move  toward this new chapter.    Mr. Museveni paid tribute to the people of South Africa who  sacrificed a great deal in the struggle for freedom. He singled  out Nelson Mandela, Oliver Tambo, (Subukwe) among others as  people who refused to surrender their right to freedom despite  the terrible hardships they went through. He also paid tribute  to African leaders who made significant contributions to the  freedom struggle, whom he enumerated as Julius Nyerere, Kenneth  Kaunda, Samora Machel, Kwame Nkrumah, 'Abd-al-Nasir, Ben Bella,  Muammar al-Qadhdhafi, Sekou Toure, and Robert Mugabe. Mr.  Museveni said that with this new chapter in South Africa, Africa  is now free from the Cape to Cairo. He cautioned, however, that  Africa is only free in the broad-based sense, because there are  still many problems to solve, such as the present conflicts in  Rwanda, Burundi, the Sudan, and Angola. He also pointed out  that the combined gross domestic product of South Africa, East  Africa, and Nigeria is still smaller than the gross domestic  product of a small country like Belgium.    The president, who acknowledged the presence of ANC soldiers  at the celebrations, said that since the National Resistance  Movement came to government in 1986, it has given assistance to  the ANC in line with the OAU policy. This assistance culminated  in the receiving of ANC soldiers in Uganda after they were  forced to leave Angola in order to pave the way for the  independence of Namibia. [passage omitted]     "

AFRICA, ANC LEADERS START HISTORIC TALKS      By SCOTT KRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER      CAPE TOWN, South Africa      For the first time in its 78-year history, the African National Congress  formally sat down Wednesday with South Africa's white rulers, beginning three  days of talks aimed at removing obstacles to black-white negotiations over  dismantling apartheid.    President Frederik W. de Klerk and ANC Deputy President Nelson Mandela,  standing side by side with their delegations intermingled behind them, opened  the historic discussions on a note of optimism, saying they were taking the  first steps toward restructuring South African society.    ""The vast majority of South Africans are opposed to violence, to conflict, to  intimidation and are reaching out for peaceful and just solutions,"" De Klerk  said in welcoming the ANC leaders to the lush grounds of Groote Schuur, the  330-year-old former home of South African prime ministers and site of the  talks. ""Confrontation will get us nowhere.""    Mandela said the meetings must decisively repudiate ""the terrible tradition of  a 'dialogue' between master and servant"" and begin to replace it with  ""peaceful, democratic and genuine debate, discussion and negotiation.""    ""The black masses of our country demand and expect fundamental change now and  not tomorrow,"" Mandela said.    Then, for the first time in public, the recently freed ANC leader switched  briefly into Afrikaans, the first language of De Klerk's team and of South  Africa's conservative white Afrikaners.    ""To the white community, including the Afrikaners, we say you have nothing to  fear from the ANC,"" Mandela said.    The first session adjourned Wednesday night after four hours of discussions  ""characterized by openness and straightforwardness on both sides,"" the  government and the ANC said in a joint statement. Both sides presented what  each viewed as the primary hurdles to negotiations and agreed to resume  discussions this afternoon.    The sight of the eight Afrikaner men from the government standing on the  heavily guarded estate next to 11 ANC supporters, including five of the most  notorious figures once in exile, left both government and ANC aides shaking  their heads in amazement. And it was featured prominently on state-run  television's evening newscasts.    ""If you had told me six months ago that the ANC and the government would be  standing together here today, I'd have said, 'Not in my lifetime,' "" said Caro  Hoon, an aide to one of the Cabinet ministers involved in the talks.    Before the talks began, De Klerk and Mandela, who have met three times  previously, appeared at ease as they addressed reporters gathered outside the  Cape Dutch-style house at the foot of Devil's Peak. After De Klerk's remarks,  Mandela turned to the president and said quietly, in Afrikaans, ""Very good  statement."" De Klerk nodded his thanks and smiled.    Although the talks are only a first step toward more substantive negotiations,  they mark a victory for the sweeping reforms that De Klerk launched exactly  three months ago. In an attempt to lure blacks to the negotiating table, De  Klerk unbanned the ANC and other anti-apartheid groups, lifted most  restrictions on black political activity and released the 71-year-old Mandela  and two others on the ANC's delegation after 27 years in prison.    The closed-door talks, requested by the ANC, center on the obstacles still  standing in the way of black-white negotiations for a new South African  constitution.    De Klerk said his government will raise the problem of escalating unrest in the  townships, which he blames on the ANC's refusal to formally abandon its  30-year-old guerrilla war against Pretoria.    The ANC, on the other hand, refuses to enter formal negotiations until De Klerk  lifts the state of emergency that has curtailed many civil rights in the  country for four years, releases about 2,000 political prisoners from South  African jails and allows the ANC's 15,000 members in exile to return home  without fear of prosecution.    De Klerk granted temporary immunity from prosecution to the five exiled ANC  leaders attending this week's talks.    De Klerk says the ANC is only one of many groups, both black and white, that he  is trying to bring into discussions about the country's future. And he said  Wednesday that the government will ""continue its discussion with other leaders  and parties . . . to encourage negotiation.""    The president envisions a new constitution that would extend full voting rights  to the 27 million blacks, provide political protection for the country's 5  million whites and abolish the remaining vestiges of apartheid that still grant  whites a life of privilege by creating segregated residential areas, schools  and hospitals.    But the ANC, the most powerful opposition group in the country, wants the  constitution to be drawn up by a constituent assembly elected in a one-person,  one-vote election of all races. It also says it will reject any attempts to  give whites veto power under a new constitution.    The ANC's delegation to the talks includes six blacks, two people of  mixed-race, two whites and one Indian. Among them are two of the key figures in  the ANC's military wing in exile -- Joe Slovo, the white former chief of staff  of Umkhonto we Sizwe (Spear of the Nation) and leader of the South African  Communist Party, and Joe Modise, the black commander of Umkhonto we Sizwe.    Both the government and the ANC are under international pressure to reach a  peaceful settlement. But they also face pressure from their own constituencies,  which have seen increasing defections to left- and right-wing groups.    The ANC is struggling to maintain its support among more radical young  activists, many of whom want to maintain the ""armed struggle"" until the  government ends apartheid and agrees to hand over power to leaders selected in  a one-person, one-vote election.    De Klerk is trying to maintain the support of South Africa's more conservative  whites, many of whom view the ANC with deep suspicion and fear that the  government has put itself on a course that will result in black domination,  just as successive white governments have dominated blacks.    Many right-wing whites have begun arming themselves in recent weeks to prevent  their property from what they believe will be a black takeover.      Photo, South Africa's F.

Jackson decided she'd made a mistake, that Cotton was not the man who committed  the stickup inside a federal credit union office at the station. And she  decided to try to reverse the conviction that she and 11 other jurors had voted  in Long Beach Superior Court.    ""I'm the victim in this,"" she declared.    It is not unusual for jurors to have second thoughts after ruling on a  hard-fought criminal case. But prosecution and defense attorneys agree that  Jackson's actions were extraordinary: She called FBI agents and private  investigators who had looked into the case. She copied police reports that had  never gotten to the jury. She met with Cotton in jail.    Finally, she filed a declaration renouncing her vote of guilty and asked  Superior Court Judge Eugene J. Long to order a new trial. At her instigation,  the jury foreman filed a similar declaration.    On Wednesday, when Long brushed aside Jackson's change of heart and sentenced  Cotton to six years in prison, one of the most disappointed people in court was  the former juror who had made his case her personal crusade.    For Jackson, a 45-year-old community affairs officer for the Los Angeles County  Department of Children's Services, the crusade began moments after the jury  ended six days of deliberations April 10. The panel found Cotton guilty of one  count of robbery but failed to reach a verdict on a charge that he took $38,835  from a courier at the Queen Mary/Spruce Goose attractions in Long Beach; the  vote was 11 to 1, with Jackson holding out.    She was walking from the jurors' box when she saw Cotton's mother in the  courtroom and decided to explain to the woman why she had voted to convict him  of the credit union robbery: Eyewitnesses had easily pointed Cotton out in  court, after all, and testimony painted an unappealing portrait of him as  someone who at one time kept ledgers for a drug dealer.    Cotton's mother, Earnest Cotton, responded by saying, ""I want to show you some  reports,"" Jackson recalled.    They were investigative notes and crime reports, including speculation by an  FBI agent who interviewed Cotton that he was not the likely robber because he  did not seem ""bright enough to pull off the heists and his life style wasn't  commensurate with someone who had come into some big cash.""      Descriptions Conflict    The reports also included witness descriptions of the robber as a man of medium  height and build. Cotton is a 6-foot, 210-pound former boxer ""who looks a lot  like Mike Tyson,"" she said.    ""They didn't show us any of that. That's evidence. That's hard evidence,""  Jackson exclaimed while studying over the documents spread across the dining  room table of her Signal Hill condominium.    Jackson said she never would have voted to convict if she had seen such  material.    ""I started getting mad as I read them. If I'm going to make a decision, I think  you would give me everything to . . . make a decision with,"" she said.    To Deputy Dist. Atty. Kirk Newkirk, who prosecuted the case, Jackson is an  example of a naive juror who does not understand court procedure. In almost all  cases, certain material is kept from the jury because of rules of evidence or  trial strategy.    ""The only miscarriage of justice was that she hung on Count 1,"" Newkirk said,  referring to the Queen Mary holdup. If other jurors made a habit of asking the  court to reverse verdicts, he noted, ""the system would achieve meltdown.""    Police speculated that the same person committed the two Long Beach holdups,  occurring in January and February of 1988. Cotton became a suspect because he  had worked for an armored car company that served the credit union and quit  shortly before the robberies, failing even to pick up his last paycheck.    Cotton said he was in Mississippi at the time, but the victims identified his  photograph and he was arrested.    To ask the judge to set aside the verdict, Jackson typed out a declaration in  proper legal form with the help of a friend who works in the courts. The  13-page document elaborates the reasons she changed her mind.    In imposing sentence Wednesday, the judge made only passing reference to the  juror's petition and commended the defense attorney -- whom Jackson had  criticized. ""This was a planned, premeditated, sophisticated robbery,"" Long  said, agreeing with the prosecutor that Cotton should have been found guilty of  the Queen Mary robbery as well.    Outside court, a shaken Jackson condemned ""the system,"" and said she still  believes she had not overstepped her role.    ""I'm not passing the buck and I'm not saying I'm irresponsible . . . but I have  a right to look into it if what I'm saying is putting someone in jail,"" she  said.

0,FT933-1164 ,"FT933-1164 _AN-DIZABAAFFT 930925   FT  25 SEP 93 / Mandela plea spurs lifting of S African sanctions      By PHILIP GAWITH      NEW YORK   COUNTRIES around the world began lifting sanctions on South Africa last night after an appeal from Mr Nelson Mandela, president of the African National Congress. Only hours after Mr Mandela's call at the United Nations in New York, the US Senate approved legislation lifting US sanctions. Canada, Australia and the Commonwealth leadership said they would follow suit. Mr Mandela, urging that all economic sanctions against South Africa be lifted in an attempt to end the country's isolation, said victory against apartheid was in sight. Addressing a specially convened meeting of the UN Special Committee Against Apartheid, which has spearheaded the sanctions drive over the past three decades, Mr Mandela asked governments 'to take all necessary measures to end the economic sanctions you imposed'. His plea came a day after South Africa's parliament approved the creation of a multi-racial Transitional Executive Council giving blacks a say in government for the first time. Mr Mandela called on the international investment community to 'help regenerate the South African economy'. He said steps should be taken to prevent South Africa becoming another Somalia or Bosnia. Sanctions had brought it to the point 'where the transition to democracy has now been enshrined in the law of our country'. The passage of the South African legislation has been welcomed by President Bill Clinton as an 'historic step'. He said the US would launch 'initiatives to help restore economic growth' to South Africa. These include supporting South African access to the IMF and World Bank. Mr Mandela's call comes at the beginning of a crucial 10-day period in which senior officials of the government and the ANC will be seeking to convince investors and donors that they should invest in South Africa. Mr Clinton later announced that the commerce secretary, Mr Ron Brown, is to lead a trade and investment mission to South Africa to explore business opportunities, particularly with the black private sector.

By SCOTT KRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER      PRETORIA, South Africa      The African National Congress early today suspended its 30-year-old armed  struggle against the white minority-led government of South Africa in an  agreement that both sides described as ""a milestone on the road to true peace  and prosperity in our country.""    The historic declaration by the government and the country's primary guerrilla  movement, coming at the end of a 14-hour meeting in Pretoria, cleared the ANC's  remaining obstacles to formal negotiations.    ""The way is now open to proceed towards negotiations on a new constitution,""  the two sides said in a joint statement. They added that ""exploratory talks"" on  ways of launching those negotiations will be held soon.    The ANC-government accord set in motion a plan for the phased release of  political prisoners and indemnity for returning exiles. Under that plan, the  first prisoner releases will begin on Sept. 1 and indemnity declarations will  begin on Oct. 1. The entire process will be completed by April 30, 1991.    The government also agreed to give ""immediate consideration"" to repealing all  provisions of the Internal Security Act that make it a crime to further the  aims of a Communist organization as well as those provisions that create a  category of ""listed"" people and prohibit the publication of their statements or  writings.    It also said it will continue reviewing legislation ""to ensure free political  activity"" and will introduce amendments to security legislation at the next  session of Parliament in February, 1991.    The agreement, revealed early this morning at a joint news conference by  President Frederik W. de Klerk and ANC Deputy President Nelson Mandela, brought  to an end a guerrilla war, launched in 1960 by Mandela, that has claimed  hundreds of lives, injured thousands and caused millions of dollars in property  damage.    ""There will be no infiltrations of men and arms into South Africa, and any  activity related to military action will be suspended,"" Mandela said. ""And we  hope to be able to communicate with our people and inform them of what we've  decided.""    Mandela called the ANC's move ""a significant concession.""    Under the agreement, a working group of ANC and government representatives will  be established to deal with any disagreements over the guerrilla war  suspension.    The ANC's armed struggle has been mostly dormant in recent months, but the  government has maintained that the ANC's continuing commitment to its military  strategy has caused an increase in violence in South Africa's black townships.    The two five-man teams from the ANC and the government expressed ""serious  concern about the general level of violence, intimidation and unrest in the  country, especially in Natal (province),"" their joint statement said. And both  sides agreed to take steps to stabilize the situation ""in line with the spirit  of mutual trust . . . among the leaders involved.""    One of the most violent regions is Natal, in eastern South Africa, where  supporters of the ANC have been battling followers of Zulu Chief Mangosuthu  Gatsha Buthelezi. Three years of factional fighting there have claimed some  3,000 lives.    The government agreed today to consider lifting the state of emergency in Natal  province ""as early as possible.""    ""We feel there will hopefully be a fundamental change in the situation on the  ground"" as a result of the agreement, De Klerk said. Although the ANC says the  fighting in Natal is not being directed by its armed wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe  (Spear of the Nation), some analysts believe the ANC's previous refusal to  suspend the armed struggle has fueled the fighting, especially among young  radicals in the ANC.    ""We think what has happened today forms an important turning point, which will  in all probability result in a much more peaceful situation in South Africa,""  De Klerk said.    The ANC and the government disagreed strongly, however, on the activities of  the South African police in quelling anti-apartheid protest in the country.  More than 125 activists have been killed in police action, much of it aimed at  halting protest marches, since the ANC and other organizations were unbanned in  February.    De Klerk said the ""police should at all times deal with violence in an  evenhanded manner,"" and he added that the government would investigate ANC  allegations of police brutality.    ""We are not satisfied with the reply of the state president,"" Mandela countered  at the news conference. ""The actions of the police indicate to us that the  government has not succeeded in curtailing police action. We feel quite  dissatisfied with the way the state is dealing with peaceful protest.    ""There is something wrong. The government has either lost control over the  police or the police are doing what the government wants,"" Mandela said. He  added, however, that ""the ANC accepts the government's assurances"" that it will  investigate instances of police misbehavior.    Many of those police clashes with demonstrators have followed ANC-organized  protests. Mandela said the ANC is not abandoning its strategy of mass protest  actions, which have included consumer boycotts and marches.    But, he said, the new accord provides channels of communication between the ANC  and the government ""that can be used to defuse any situation that calls for  mass action.""    Although they hailed their agreement as the first real step toward peace in  South Africa, the government-ANC statement alluded to the fact that other  parties, including Buthelezi's Inkatha movement, left-wing black organizations  and right-wing whites, must now become involved in the process to keep it  moving ahead.    ""We do not pretend to be the only parties involved in the process of shaping  the new South Africa,"" their statement said. ""All of us can henceforth walk  that road in consultation and cooperation with each other. We call upon all  those who have not yet committed themselves to peaceful negotiations to do so  now.""    The most important ANC precondition for constitutional negotiations was the  freedom of political prisoners and the return of exiles without fear of  prosecution.    Human rights organizations estimate that there are 2,500 to 3,000 people in  South African prisons on convictions for politically motivated crimes, and more  than 1,600 people currently are on trial for political offenses. The government  has estimated that there are fewer than 400 political prisoners.    Among the estimated 35,000 political exiles living outside South Africa, at  least 6,000 are soldiers in the ANC's military wing, and several thousand  others are involved in activities that might subject them to prosecution upon  their return.    The ANC-government agreement acknowledges De Klerk's power to pardon prisoners  and grant indemnity to those activists, including exiles, who may be liable to  prosecution or are now undergoing trial. But both sides agree that De Klerk  will appoint a panel, by Aug. 31, to identify ""political"" prisoners on a  case-by-case basis.    The accord establishes broad guidelines for that panel's decision-making,  suggesting, for example, that the definition of a political crime could range  from purely political offenses such as treason to common crimes, including  murder. In the case of common crimes, the ANC-government agreement urges the  panel to consider several circumstances, including the motive of the offender,  the context in which the offense was committed and the nature of the political  objective.      BACKGROUND    The African National Congress has undergone radical changes since it was  launched in 1912 as the South African Native National Congress, a small group  led by traditional chiefs. It was primarily a pressure group promoting the  interests of black Africans by using legal means, such as petitions to the  government. It began to resemble a mass liberation movement in the 1940s, when  it adopted a constitution calling for universal suffrage. A Youth League was  formed in 1943, attracting more radical blacks such as Nelson Mandela and  Walter Sisulu, and the young radicals took control of the ANC in 1949. The  shooting of unarmed demonstrators by police at Sharpeville in 1960 and the  outlawing of the ANC the following year forced the organization to review its  nonviolent strategy.

Speaking to several hundred business leaders from around the world at a meeting of the World Economic Forum in Cape Town, President Mandela declared South Africa's support for the creation of free trade agreement between eastern and southern African states and said he hoped an African common market would be established 'in the near future'. President Joaquim Chissano of Mozambique, President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe and President Ali Hassan Mwinyi of Tanzania, who also addressed the summit as part of a panel, made similar commitments. They said the demise of apartheid in South Africa meant that, for the first time, frontline states were able to enter into a co-operative relationship with their giant neighbour to the south. Over the past few months there has been widespread debate over future economic plans for the southern African region, with most neighbouring countries eager to encourage the export of South African skills and investments but fearful the country might use its power to gain regional domination. The meeting appeared to indicate a desire on both sides to approach the issue cautiously, while highlighting to the rest of the world that most countries in the region were now politically stable and supportive of free market policies. Mr Mandela's speech opening the two-day meeting, was clearly designed to reassure potential investors about the new government's commitment to a stable, free market economy. He pledged his government would not pursue any policies that might 'upset market balance and undermine fiscal stability'. President Mandela also insisted the government would not consider nationalising industries, although it was still a strategy that could be used at 'appropriate time' such as after a war. However he was vehemently opposed to any further privatisation of state corporations.   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.   Industries:-  P9611 Administration of General Economic Programs.

But now, as the country faces perhaps its greatest political crisis to date, the face on prime time television screens is not Mr F W de Klerk, the president, but Mr Nelson Mandela, leader of the African National Congress. When Mr Chris Hani, the guerrilla leader, was assassinated, Mr Mandela broadcast a live address to appeal for calm. On the eve of last Wednesday's national day of mourning, Mr Mandela addressed the nation at 7pm, 8pm and 11pm. For his part, Mr de Klerk issued a statement from his seaside holiday home, via his press secretary resting at another holiday resort. There can be no clearer evidence of the profound shift which has occurred in the balance of power between white and black. The ruling National Party still insists that it will never 'hand over power' to blacks; but most of their supporters think they have already done so. Gone are the days when Mr P W Botha, the former president, would simply declare a nationwide state of emergency and detain 50,000 people to deal with a crisis. Mr de Klerk's language over the past few days has recalled the hardline rhetoric of the finger-wagging former President. But he cannot match him in action. The fact is that Mr de Klerk cannot rule South Africa without Mr Mandela's help. With his dark threats against 'radicals' (which he knows he cannot carry out without sparking civil war) and his frantic warnings of a descent into chaos, Mr de Klerk has cut a somewhat pathetic figure in recent days. He may be President, but Mr Mandela is South Africa's leader. This was never more apparent than when the ANC leader dominated TV screens on Tuesday evening (furious that his address had been cut in half for the 8pm newscast, he insisted on - and was granted - the right to broadcast again in full at 11pm). Speaking with all the dignity and gravitas of the tribal African chieftain which he is, Mr Mandela tried to use his eloquence and authority to heal the racial rift caused by the murder of one of black South Africa's greatest heroes. 'Tonight I am reaching out to every single South African, black and white, from the very depths of my being,' he said. He praised the white woman who had risked her life to identify Mr Hani's assassin and condemned those who would 'plunge our country into another Angola.' 'Now is the time for all South Africans to stand together against those who, from any quarter, wish to destroy what Chris Hani gave his life for - the freedom of all of us.' Mr de Klerk's statements, by contrast, have been clearly partisan in nature, aimed at his white constituents, who have been outraged and terrified by the violence which has followed the assassination. He has showed little understanding of the anger and loss felt by the black majority; his condolences lacked sincerity. Mr de Klerk was no doubt worried that too sympathetic a response would antagonise whites, who largely viewed Mr Hani as a communist demon. But for a man who portrays himself as the natural leader of a multi-racial South Africa, he has showed little ability to bridge the racial gulf. Mr Mandela's leadership abilities are also under severe strain. Dealing with large, young, militant crowds is not his forte. His style of public speaking is pedantic rather than charismatic. And he will have further enraged whites by allowing his more militant ANC colleagues to persuade him that the ANC should carry on mass protest actions for another six weeks. His task is difficult: he must be seen to respond to the anger of militant youths while keeping them under control. It will take a rare man to tread that tightrope for a further six weeks.

In a pointed interview at the weekend, Mr Gonzalez hinted that he might resign as party leader if the Socialist party machine did not take political responsibility for the scandal. At issue is the so-called Filesa affair - named after a bogus consulting company, run by senior party officials, which took money from big business in return for industrial research which was never done. The money was used to pay Socialist election expenses in the late 1980s. The affair has hurt the party in polls ahead of elections which must be held before the end of the year. It has also sharpened old tensions between Mr Gonzalez's conservatively minded government and the more radical party, which has vigorously denied it had anything to do with Filesa. Mr Gonzalez had not wanted to stand for a fourth term as prime minister, but was persuaded to do so by the party, which sees that its only chance of winning over the electorate is with him as leader. However, he has begun to realise that public opinion is heavily against waiting for a court ruling on Filesa and in favour of a show of political responsibility - one or more senior resignations - by the party or government. In his interview on Spanish radio, he said he was not pressing anyone to resign but hinted that he was not prepared to go to the electorate with the scandal hanging over him. If Mr Gonzalez were to withdraw, there seems little doubt that the Socialists would suffer severe reverses. A party executive meeting scheduled for today has been delayed until Saturday as party infighting intensifies. The most likely candidate for sacrifice would be the No 3 man in the party, Mr Jose Maria Benegas who has, it is reported, already offered to resign. A Basque, Mr Benegas is an old Socialist warrior who has courageously stood up to intimidation from Basque separatist terrorists in the past. But under his direction the party has failed to satisfy public unease about the financing scandals.   Countries:-  ESZ  Spain, EC.   Industries:-  P8651 Political Organizations.

Shevardnadze also held an hourlong meeting with De Klerk, who was in Windhoek  to officially relinquish South African control of its former colony.

Hofland: ""The Spreading of the  Scandal""]    [Text] The scandal occupying U.S. politics under the  collective name of Whitewater is approaching the point where it  will become too big to be tamed. It is just like the legendary  laboratory rat which has received too many growth hormones and  is now showing signs of growing into a monster of Spielberg-like  dimensions. As is the case with scandals, it is being  cheerfully fed by the many people who have an interest in the  destruction of the suspected victims. It is an omnivore of  rumors, revelations, hatred, pleasure in the misfortune of  others, panic, good intentions and the regular people's court of  investigations. If it is not killed in time, then it will  outgrow everyone, as happened with Watergate, which cost more  people than Nixon their political life. Seen from a distance,  the scandal is growing into a play where witches' cabals,  purification and self-destruction can no longer be separated  out. At this stage Whitewater already stands for an innumerable  quantity of suspicions, errors, contradictory interests, shadowy  affairs, embezzlements, a whole which in itself asks for  clarifications. There is only one conclusion to be drawn: This  could well last for a long time.    The U.S. scandal, in addition to being theatre along the  lines of drama, is also an obstacle which has virtually halted  foreign policy. When Joseph McCarthy declared that he had a  list of 254 members of the communist party who had infiltrated  the State Department, he kept Eisenhower's and Dulles' hands  full with more than a year of work. Watergate meant a temporary  end to the rest of the world for the Americans. Reagan proved  to have more understanding of scandal management. While the  evidence piled up about his involvement in, or at least  knowledge of the Iran-Contra scandal, his enemies did not  succeed in damaging his presidency. He could not be disturbed  as he continued to fight the evil empire and then wind down the  Cold War. That was genius. When Bush took over, the  Republicans' front had closed up again, the confusion about the  smoldering scandal worked against his opponents and the urgency  had disappeared.    The Whitewater affair is totally different. At present  everything would indicate that the zenith has yet to be reached.  It is difficult to say how much hatred has been generated by  Clinton over the last two years. He successfully pushed his  affair with Jennifer Flowers into the background during the  election campaign. He managed to overcome the disadvantages of  his Vietnam past, he did not go there. Attempts to reveal  others affairs have been derailed. His plan to reform the  health care system is arousing fanatical opposition. The fact  that the economy is recovering well under a Democratic  presidency is not putting the Republicans in a good mood.  Everything is contributing at present to making Whitewater the  occasion for revenge.    We know that after the end of the Cold War, U.S. interest in  West Europe weakened considerably. The first cause is the  concentration on the big domestic issues, the second is the  European incapacity to solve the conflict in Bosnia. Other  priorities are emerging within the limited field of Washington's  interests. Last year at approximately this time the bomb  exploded under the World Trade Center. Those responsible have  been imprisoned for life. The initial investigation and trial  led to a suspicion that they are part of a wider conspiracy.  The suspicion has become stronger with the attack last week on  four orthodox Jewish students, one of whom has in the meantime  died. In the background the fear is growing that the conflict  between Israel and the Arabs is being extended to New York.    The unmasking of a CIA agent as a Russian spy has not  boosted  confidence in this famous secret service. Many murders occur in  the United States, ever greater efforts to fight them are taking  place, but political crimes and political terrorism  traditionally arouse extra opposition, as shown by the fate of  the Rosenbergs and Sacco and Vanzetti. Because then the efforts  have to be mobilized against foreigners with dangerous political  intentions.    The latest indication that Washington wants the least  possible involvement with problems in Europe, be it West,  Central or East, can be found in the visit by Shevardnadze, once  a faithful interlocutor of Reagan and now president of a  distant, small country in a civil war. It is rare that a  visiting president has been pushed into the well of oblivion so  quickly, although he did receive a promise of $70 million in all  sorts of aid, but without any perspective of U.S. participation  in a UN peace force.    The Whitewater scandal is developing in these circumstances.  Even if things turn out well for the Clintons, in any case they  will certainly have their hands full for a good time. This  means that West Europe will be able to count on a U.S. presence  even less than during the last two to three years. Fourteen  days ago U.S. fighters under the supervision of NATO shot down  four Serbian planes. The Europeans will have to content  themselves with that example. As long as Whitewater lasts,  Europe will have to clean things up itself.    Politics are surprising. The only person who will presently  be benefiting from an investment project in Arkansas 16 years  ago, and the obscurity which followed it, is the ethnic chief  Karadzic, who is investing in death and destruction.

0,FT942-15461 ,"FT942-15461 _AN-EDOC4ABBFT 940415   FT  15 APR 94 / South African Elections (April 26-28): South African mediation effort fails      By PATTI WALDMEIR and MARK SUZMAN      JOHANNESBURG   An attempt to resolve South Africa's political crisis through foreign mediation collapsed yesterday. Mediators packed their bags and left the country's political parties to their disputes. 'The fact that it has failed fills me with sadness,' Lord Carrington, former British foreign secretary, told reporters as he, Mr Henry Kissinger, former US secretary of state, and five fellow mediators cut short their mission after the parties failed to provide them with agreed terms of reference. The failure of mediation, less than two weeks before planned all-race elections on April 26-28, will seriously undermine hopes for a peaceful poll and for stability of the new government. Constitutional negotiations appear to have reached a dead end, though African National Congress president Nelson Mandela said last night he was prepared to continue talking to the mainly Zulu Inkatha Freedom party. In reality, negotiations are likely to resume after the poll. In the meantime, the ANC will continue trying to do a separate deal with Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini, to guarantee his constitutional status and persuade him to endorse the poll. The ANC will also push for a further security crackdown in KwaZulu/Natal, power base of Zulu Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, Inkatha leader. Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, ANC secretary general, said more troops would be sent to the area to deal with a predicted surge in violence. Mr Ramaphosa made an unprecedented visit to the Johannesburg Stock Exchange to warn brokers of the imminent collapse of mediation. Markets reacted negatively. The JSE's overall equity index weakened 68 to 4,955 and the commercial rand, the trading currency, dipped 0.62 cents against the dollar to close in London at R3.6008 in spite of central bank intervention. Mr Mandela and President F W de Klerk were last night at pains to stress their desire for reconciliation when they took part in South Africa's first ever televised election debate. 'I am proud to hold your hand. Let us work together to end division and suspicion,' Mr Mandela told local television viewers and millions more watching the live debate on CNN Worldwide, as he grasped the hand of Mr de Klerk.

Launching the manifesto at Nasrec outside Soweto, ANC President  Nelson Mandela said the future government billed increased jobs  with higher incomes, housing with electricity and water,  education and health care as priorities.    The theme of the ANC's election manifesto is ""a better life  for all"". Apart from promising to uphold all the basic  conditions experienced in an ideal democratic society, the ANC  have an ambitious reconstruction and development programme. An  ANC government hopes to be successful in stopping the violence,  which will encourage foreign investment. Thus with expectations  of a dynamic and growing economy, the ANC plans to address the  high unemployment.    Their national public works programme alone promises  training  and jobs for about 2.5 million people over the next 10 years,  building roads and much-needed facilities.    Education was also a top priority and the ANC plan to use  the  R[Rand]23 billion already set aside for education to give, among  other education programmes, all youths 10 years of free and  compulsory education and double the number of free text books    The ANC promise to focus on the seven million squatters and  homeless by tackling the housing crisis. They promise that  within the next five years, an ANC government could build over  one million new homes, provide running water and flush toilet to  more than one million families and electrify 2.5 million rural  and urban homes.    As for land reform, the ANC government will guarantee  victims  of forced removals restitution, to be carried out fairly through  a land claims court. State land will be used to implement land  reform. Health will become more affordable under an ANC  government with cheaper treatment and medicines and free health  care for children under five years old    Overall, the ANC plans to increase public expenditure  without  raising taxes on ordinary people. The ANC will end vat on basic  foods like flour, milk and sugar, reduce income taxes on those  earning under R4,000 a month and end unfair taxation of women,  married and single. But they will make sure every business pays  its fair share.    By investing in jobs, housing and education, the ANC believe  the economy will grow and bring in more revenue. They are also  relying on beneficial international aid and loans. Plus, their  objective is to carefully use money available carefully without  squandering funds to corruption and bureaucracy, as in the past.    All security forces will be reformed to reflect the national  character and a new volunteer army will deal with the defence of  the country without being involved in political matters.    Detention without trial will be done away with and the  system  of justice will be made more accessible, cheap and fair to  everyone.    In foreign affairs, the ANC government will become a full  member of the Organisation of African Unity, United Nations,  non-aligned movement, the Commonwealth and other international  bodies.    The question is: Can Mr Mandela fulfill these extravagant  campaign promises? Criticism has already begun.    Vague on many vital question like taxation and land reform,  it could give masses the impression they will be all be enjoying  the living standards of the white middle class.    Critics say the manifesto was irresponsible and could create  problems. Should the sad reality not meet their expectations,  there are fears their disillusionment could turn to violence.    So far, Mr Mandela has been careful to avoid making wild  promises. He has been reported as saying it could take ""some  years"" for a government to respond fully to the need of black  people after 300 years of white supremacy.    As the ANC stressed in their manifesto, only if everyone  works together in an environment of peace and stability, can  their plans succeed.     "

Nelson Mandela, the African National Congress leader, called the action  ""totally useless"" and said it amounted to a partial reimposition of the  national emergency that the government lifted in three of the country's four  provinces in June.    ""I totally disagree that these measures are necessary,"" Mandela said. He  criticized the government for not consulting the ANC but added that peace  negotiations with the government would continue.    Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok, in imposing the strict measures, said that  ""the normal laws of the country are no longer sufficient"" to quell the  violence, which pits Zulu supporters of Chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi  against non-Zulu ANC sympathizers.    Vlok also invoked a law that allows the police to disarm township residents of  33 specific weapons, including spears, pitchforks, screwdrivers, hammers,  crossbows and bricks. And he announced that the number of police officers,  backed by army units, would be ""drastically increased"" in the affected  townships, among them Soweto, the country's largest.    The police have been sharply criticized by the ANC, which contends that the  authorities are aiding Zulu warriors. The police deny this.    ""People will now realize the government is serious about ending the violence,""  Vlok said, adding that he will ""not hesitate to institute stricter measures"" if  the trouble continues.    President Frederik W. de Klerk told supporters of his National Party that the  emergency powers were intended as a short-term solution.    ""We dare not allow radicals to send this country up in flames,"" De Klerk said  in a televised question-and-answer session sponsored by his party. ""We will try  with every means at our disposal to impartially impose law and order.""    John Dugard, a civil rights legal expert in Johannesburg, said he did not look  on the extra measures as a step backward for the country's peace process.    ""The government has been under pressure, and this is their way of saying  they're going to do something,"" Dugard said. ""They don't need these extra  powers, but they have just seemed unwilling to disarm people.""    Vlok's designation of the 27 townships as ""unrest areas"" and his granting of  police emergency powers to suspend civil rights come under a 1986 provision of  the little-used Public Safety Act of 1953. Vlok said the special powers would  apply for three months but could be extended.    The order gives the police in unrest areas authority to forcibly disperse  groups, detain people without trial for up to three months, search without a  warrant, shut down businesses, take over essential services, impose curfews and  prevent media access to conflict areas.    ""We cannot tolerate this killing of innocent people,"" Vlok told a news  conference in Pretoria. ""We intend to really do our level best to remove those  people who are responsible for the violence.""    Vlok acknowledged that the new measures ""could be harmful to the image of the  country."" But, he added, ""It is in the interest of South Africa and all its  inhabitants that further bloodshed, disorder and chaos be prevented at all  costs.""    Meanwhile, Mandela and De Klerk met for 40 minutes to discuss ""certain  practical aspects"" of ANC-government agreements, according to De Klerk's  office. Under those accords, the ANC has agreed to suspend its guerrilla war  against Pretoria, and the government has promised to begin freeing political  prisoners and granting immunity from prosecution to returning exiles.    Mandela said there was no time during the meeting to raise his objections to  the new emergency decree. The ANC deputy president is to depart today for a  weeklong trip to Norway, Libya and Algeria.    The current round of fighting began on Aug. 13 in Tokoza township southeast of  Johannesburg and quickly spread to Soweto and other area townships. Most of the  clashes have been between migrant Zulus living in large, crowded hostels and  township residents, many of whom are Xhosas. Mandela is a Xhosa, and much of  the ANC's leadership is made up of Xhosas.    The ANC and Buthelezi's Inkatha are trying to get top-level talks started in an  effort to end the violence, and each has issued a call for peace. But Mandela  has rejected Buthelezi's requests for a meeting.    Political analysts say the fighting is an outgrowth of ANC-Inkatha clashes  among Zulus in Natal province, Buthelezi's home base, where nearly 4,000 blacks  have been killed in factional fighting since 1987.    The ANC contends that Inkatha supporters initiated the Johannesburg-area  violence in frustration over the ANC's growing role in talks with the  government. But government officials say the source of the conflict is the  historical tribal rivalry between Zulus and Xhosas.    De Klerk lifted the 4-year-old national state of emergency on June 8 but left  it in place in Natal. The ANC has demanded the total lifting of the emergency  decree as a condition for formal negotiations on a new constitution.

""People will now realize the government is serious about ending the violence,""  Vlok said, adding that he will ""not hesitate to institute stricter measures"" if  the trouble continues.    President Frederik W. de Klerk told supporters of his National Party that the  emergency powers were intended as a short-term solution.    ""We dare not allow radicals to send this country up in flames,"" De Klerk said  in a televised question-and-answer session sponsored by his party. ""We will try  with every means at our disposal to impartially impose law and order.""    John Dugard, a civil rights legal expert in Johannesburg, said he did not look  on the extra measures as a step backward for the country's peace process.    ""The government has been under pressure, and this is their way of saying  they're going to do something,"" Dugard said. ""They don't need these extra  powers, but they have just seemed unwilling to disarm people.""    Vlok's designation of the 27 townships as ""unrest areas"" and his granting of  police emergency powers to suspend civil rights come under a 1986 provision of  the little-used Public Safety Act of 1953. Vlok said the special powers would  apply for three months but could be extended.    The order gives the police in unrest areas authority to forcibly disperse  groups, detain people without trial for up to three months, search without a  warrant, shut down businesses, take over essential services, impose curfews and  prevent media access to conflict areas.    ""We cannot tolerate this killing of innocent people,"" Vlok told a news  conference in Pretoria. ""We intend to really do our level best to remove those  people who are responsible for the violence.""    Vlok acknowledged that the new measures ""could be harmful to the image of the  country."" But, he added, ""It is in the interest of South Africa and all its  inhabitants that further bloodshed, disorder and chaos be prevented at all  costs.""    Meanwhile, Mandela and De Klerk met for 40 minutes to discuss ""certain  practical aspects"" of ANC-government agreements, according to De Klerk's  office. Under those accords, the ANC has agreed to suspend its guerrilla war  against Pretoria, and the government has promised to begin freeing political  prisoners and granting immunity from prosecution to returning exiles.    Mandela said there was no time during the meeting to raise his objections to  the new emergency decree. The ANC deputy president is to depart today for a  weeklong trip to Norway, Libya and Algeria.    The current round of fighting began on Aug. 13 in Tokoza township southeast of  Johannesburg and quickly spread to Soweto and other area townships. Most of the  clashes have been between migrant Zulus living in large, crowded hostels and  township residents, many of whom are Xhosas. Mandela is a Xhosa, and much of  the ANC's leadership is made up of Xhosas.    The ANC and Buthelezi's Inkatha are trying to get top-level talks started in an  effort to end the violence, and each has issued a call for peace. But Mandela  has rejected Buthelezi's requests for a meeting.    Political analysts say the fighting is an outgrowth of ANC-Inkatha clashes  among Zulus in Natal province, Buthelezi's home base, where nearly 4,000 blacks  have been killed in factional fighting since 1987.    The ANC contends that Inkatha supporters initiated the Johannesburg-area  violence in frustration over the ANC's growing role in talks with the  government. But government officials say the source of the conflict is the  historical tribal rivalry between Zulus and Xhosas.    De Klerk lifted the 4-year-old national state of emergency on June 8 but left  it in place in Natal. The ANC has demanded the total lifting of the emergency  decree as a condition for formal negotiations on a new constitution.

The ANC leader, in London to address a Confederation of British Industry conference, was responding to a speech by President F W de Klerk in Stellenbosch on Monday. Mr de Klerk suggested a referendum as a way of ending a deadlock caused by a boycott of the talks by the Inkatha Freedom Party, the ANC's main black rivals, and the extreme right Conservative party. Mr Mandela, who received an explanatory telephone call from Mr de Klerk on Monday night said: 'At no time did President de Klerk make a specific proposal that a referendum should be held. All that he said was that this was a matter which must be addressed in one way or the other. One way might be to have a referendum.' Some political analysts in South Africa have suggested that holding a referendum would allow the government and the ANC to claim international legitimacy and a mandate to govern in the face of right-wing opposition which could disrupt the proposed election. Addressing the CBI conference in London, Mr Mandela said he wanted a reassurance that the Freedom Alliance between right-wing whites and Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom party would recognise and accept the results of a referendum. 'I got no such reassurance,' he said, adding that a referendum was 'entirely unlikely' to resolve the situation. Earlier, Mr Mandela said South Africa should abolish exchange controls at the earliest opportunity. 'We are fully aware that the existence of exchange controls could act as a deterrent to many potential investors who may not be certain about the full implications of this system to their investments,' he said. Abandonment of the system would be possible 'once some semblance of stability returns to the economy, particularly the balance between capital inflow and outflow,' he said. Mr Mandela, who later met Mr John Major, the prime minister, was nearing the end of a trip to the US and the European Community to promote investment in South Africa.

In an emotional ceremony held just after dawn at the Ohlange High School in the black township of Inanda outside Durban, Mr Mandela repeated the eloquent words with which he addressed the court which in 1964 sentenced him to what were to be 27 years in prison: 'I have fought very firmly throughout my life against white domination and I have fought very firmly against black domination . . . I cherish the idea of a new South Africa where all South Africans are equal and where all South Africans work together to bring about security, peace and democracy.' The stately Mr Mandela, dressed in a simple beige shirt buttoned tight at the neck and casual trousers, flashed his radiant smile for the cameras as he held his ballot poised above the polling box for several seconds before dropping it in with the cry, 'Going, going, gone.' Nonetheless, the grey-haired African National Congress leader appeared visibly strained by the three-month election campaign. Surrounded by at least 20 security guards, he looked tired and drained, and every bit his age. 'This is for all South Africans an unforgettable occasion. It is the realisation of the hopes and dreams we have cherished over the decades: the dream of a South Africa that represents all South Africans. It is the beginning of a new era,' he said afterwards. Speaking outside in the school yard, Mr Mandela repeated the message he stressed incessantly in the final days of campaigning. 'We are very concerned about minorities, especially about the white minority,' he said, adding in a radio interview only seconds after his vote: 'We would like the white community to realise that we cannot build this country without them. We are appealing to them to regard themselves as an essential part of the transition' to democracy. It was a good start towards the goal of a non-racial nation. There is a hard road ahead.

He said in  Pretoria the arrests were made after more than six weeks of  intensive invstigations into a series of far-rightwing terror  attacks in the [Orange] Free State and the Western Transvaal.    Police on Monday arrested five suspects linked to  far-rightwing organisations. Some were detained in Orkney and  others in Welkom.    The SA Police over the weekend also arrested seven people,  including five suspected Azanian Peoples Liberation Army  members, in connection with the rifle and hand-grenade attack on  a swimming pool in Richard's Bay, Northern Naal, at the weekend,  Mr Kriel said. Three R5 rifles and two M26 hand-grenades were  seized when the arrests were made in Stanger, Empangeni and near  the scene of the crime in Richard's Bay.    Five right-wing extremists were detained in the Transvaal  and  the Free State and explosives and firearms were seized by the  police.    Follow-up operations by the SA Police were still in progress  and further arrests could be expected, Mr Kriel said.    During the swoop in Orkney, a suspect fired with a shotgun  at  members of the police through a closed door. A policeman,  Sergeant Johan Jonker, was hit in the chest but escaped death  because he wore a bullet-proof jacket. Police returned fire, Mr  Kriel said, and the suspect was wounded in the arm. He was  under police guard in hospital.    ""These arrests, and many others before them, explode the  myth  cultivated by Mr Nelson Mandela and the African National  Congress [ANC] that the SA Police is soft on rightwing  terrorism. ""Once again the SA police have demonstrated that  they will act without fear or favour,"" said Mr Kriel. ""These  arrests should also serve as a serious warning to both right and  left-wing extremists that the SA Police will not for a moment  hesitate to act against anyone who breaks the law, regardless of  political affiliation.""    Mr Kriel believed it was time Mr Mandela paid constructive  and credible attention to his ""criminal self-defence units,  which are trained by MK [Umkhonto we Sizwe, [Spear of the Nation  -- armed wing of the ANC]"". If Mr Mandela was interested in  fair play, he would apologise to State President F W de Klerk  and the SA Police for his recent unfounded insults. ""However,  knowing Mr Mandela, this may be too much to ask, considering  that objectivity is not one of his strong points,"" Mr Kriel said.     "

Two top scientists of the Bangalore-based Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) were arrested by Indian police on suspicion of having leaked vital information on India's space programme. Detectives will also investigate Indian press reports hinting at the involvement of two unnamed west European countries in the espionage. Bangalore's scientific community has reacted with shock and disbelief at the arrest on November 30 of Mr Nambi Narayanan, deputy director of Isro's Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre. Mr Chandrasekharan, Indian representative of Glavcosmos, the Russian space agency, was arrested on November 3 for allegedly leaking defence secrets to two Maldivian women suspected to be intelligence operatives. India successfully launched a polar satellite launch vehicle in October. The space programme has powered ahead in spite of a setback last year when the US attempted to stop Moscow from going ahead with a Dollars 250m deal to provide India with cryogenic engines.

Neither, however, will have helped the cause of President FW de Klerk, who has staked his political future on achieving a landslide 'yes' vote in the March 17 referendum. Mr Mandela's plea, carried in the mass circulation Sunday Times newspaper, was aimed at white members of the ANC, who are very few in number. But the ultra-right Conservative Party can use his message of support as proof that he and Mr de Klerk are in alliance together - a charge which the Conservatives have exploited to frighten whites. At a weekend Conservative Party rally, one poster showed Mr de Klerk as a tiny figure begging at the knee of Mr Mandela, with the slogan 'No to Mandela and his Klerk.' Mr Mandela yesterday promised a political system 'in which all the country's inhabitants feel secure'. But he warned that a 'no' vote would be read as a declaration of war by blacks, adding 'if the hopes of the majority of South Africans. . . are once more thwarted, the stress and upheavals of the past will be like a game of marbles.' Mr Botha's call for a 'no' vote will also bolster the Conservative campaign. He told a weekend newspaper that a 'yes' vote would lead to a government dominated by the ANC and its close ally, the South African Communist Party. Ironically, it was Mr Botha who initiated the political reforms pursued so dramatically by Mr de Klerk. But the two have often quarrelled since Mr Botha resigned as President in August 1989. The threat of a Communist takeover was also raised by right-wing parties at their weekend rally, with Mr Eugene Terre'blanche, the most powerful orator of the right, claiming that the referendum was a choice between 'God and the communists.' However the rally, organised by the Conservative Party, the neo-Nazi Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging (Afrikaner Resistance Movement) and the Herstigte Nasionale Party (Reconstituted National Party) was clearly a disappointment to the organisers. They had predicted tens of thousands would attend, but only around 3,000 people turned up, some dressed in the khaki uniform of the Afrikaner Resistance Movement. Right-wing leaders opened the rally by galloping into Pretoria's Church Square on horseback, though paramilitary leader Eugene Terre'blanche fell from his horse during the procession. Meanwhile Mr de Klerk outlined his 'bottom line' demands for a new political system, saying these included a free market economic system, measures to prevent the domination of minorities and ensure that 'standards' are maintained in white areas, effective protection for private property, job and pension security for white civil servants, devolution of power, an impartial security service and traditional liberal protections such as a bill of rights and independent judiciary.

Refuting rumors that Taipei-Pretoria relations are on the  brink of break-up, De Klerk reaffirmed South Africa's desire to  maintain normal diplomatic ties with the ROC.    De Klerk made the remarks during an interview with CNA after  making a campaign speech in Johannesburg.    South Africa's first multi-racial election is scheduled to  be  held nationwide on April 26-28. The African National Congress  [ANC] led by Nelson Mandela is expected to win big in the  elections resulting in the formation of a coalition government  between the ANC and De Klerk's ruling national party.    Mandela and the ANC have strong ties with the Chinese  Communists and have announced on several occasions that they  will sever ties with the ROC in favor of Beijing once in power.    However, De Klerk is expected to remain an influential  figure  in South African politics after the election and has said  ""Pretoria cherishes our relations with old friends.""     "

0,FT923-4966 ,"FT923-4966 _AN-CIEAPAEPFT 920903   FT  03 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets: Bombay makes tentative recovery from scandal - Government economic measures could help Indian share prices to rise further      By RC MURTHY   Indian bourses, enjoying their first rally for three months, are awaiting measures from the PV Narasimha Rao administration which, they hope, will stimulate the economy and boost equity values that have languished since a securities scandal broke early in May. New Delhi plans to make the rupee fully convertible, lower interest rates if prices continue to drop, relax controls on the pharmaceutical industry, and announce contracts with international oil companies for oil exploration and production. Most of these decisions are expected to be in place before Dr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister, reviews India's programmes with the International Monetary Fund in Washington in three weeks' time. The 30-share index of the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), India's largest with two-thirds of national trading, is looking back at a slump which took it as low as 2,529 in early August, down 1,938 points, or 43 per cent, from a peak of 4,467 in mid-April, prompted by the seizure of assets of Mr Harshad Mehta and other brokers implicated in the Rs35bn (Dollars 1.25bn) securities scandal. After hitting a six-month low on August 6, share prices have rebounded since then, partly in response to government decontrol of chemical fertiliser prices and as bear operators covered their positions. Gujarat State Fertilisers have gained Rs60 to Rs340 and Zuari Agro Chem are Rs90 better at Rs390. Turnover, which had contracted from Rs3bn a day seen in April to less than Rs400m four months later, recovered to Rs1.72bn by last weekend as institutions and mutual funds bought at lower levels. The market appears to have found its level, for now. Share values moved in a narrow range last week and the 30-share index, at 3,031 last Friday, was around the same level as a week earlier. Yesterday the index closed at 3,040.57, down 29.92. Mr MR Mayya, executive director of the BSE, says the market is healthier now. Selling pressure has eased and the authorities have removed all restrictions on sales. But individual investors have yet to return in force, deterred by the forthcoming rush of rights issues, following the scrapping of capital issues control last month. Some Rs50bn worth of rights issues are scheduled over the next two months. Analysts say, however, that strong fundamentals and the government measures should lift share prices further over the next three weeks. Furthermore, the monsoon rains have been evenly spread throughout the country, improving crop prospects. The question is whether police and income tax authority raids on brokers and finance companies associated with the securities scandal will hamper the market's recovery. A parliamentary committee was set up two weeks ago to inquire into the scandal and the police and income tax authorities may have to co-ordinate with it in the future.

Answer: His most significant move has been to lift a 30-year-old government ban  on the African National Congress, the primary guerrilla group fighting white  minority-led rule in South Africa. He also legalized the South African  Communist Party, a close ally of the ANC, and the Pan-Africanist Congress, a  smaller guerrilla group.    Q: What immediate effect will the unbanning of these groups have on South  Africa?    A: About 80 activists now in prison on charges of having been members of those  organizations or supporting the aims of those organizations will be freed  within a week, the government says, as soon as the paper work can be completed.  Any activists currently being held to face those charges will be freed and  their trials halted.    Q: Will other political prisoners be freed as well?    A: No. The government says people convicted on charges of violence, such as  terrorism, arson and murder, even if their aims were primarily political, will  not be freed.    Q: Then are all members of the ANC living in exile free to return home?    A: No. Exiled members of those formerly banned organizations could still face  prosecution in South Africa if the authorities think they have been involved in  illegal activities. Most exiles will probably wait until that issue is  resolved.    Q: What other action did De Klerk take?    A: De Klerk removed portions of the state of emergency, imposed in 1986, that  prohibit news coverage of unrest and political activity in schools. He lifted  travel and public speaking restrictions imposed under the emergency against 374  activists and did away with regulations that made them possible. He set a limit  of six months on the amount of time an activist may be detained without trial  and added provisions that allow detainees the right to legal representation and  a doctor of their own choosing. He also rescinded restrictions on 33 political  organizations that had been prevented from engaging in political activities  under emergency regulations.    Q: Why did De Klerk act now?    A: The president says he wants to move quickly to remove the obstacles to  negotiations and create a ""new South Africa."" He also has been under pressure  from foreign governments, including the United States, who want to see concrete  moves toward ending apartheid before they will agree to lift sanctions and  resume normal trading with South Africa.    Q: What has to be done now to get negotiations under way?    A: The ANC says Nelson R. Mandela and other political prisoners must be freed  and the state of emergency must be lifted before it will consider negotiating  with the government. Once Mandela is freed, however, the ANC will come under  increasing pressure from foreign governments to at least open ""talks about  talks"" with the government.    Q: What will happen to ""listed"" people?    A: The president has removed 150 names from the list of people who may not be  quoted or whose writings may not be published in South Africa. Among them are  leaders of the ANC, such as Oliver Tambo, Thabo Mbeki and Joe Slovo, as well as  longtime activists still in South Africa, such as Helen Joseph. More than 300  people remain ""listed,"" however.    Q: Do any provisions of the emergency decree remain intact?    A: Yes. The police will still be able to detain, without charge or trial,  anyone they consider a threat to the security of the state. Similarly, any  organization deemed a threat can be ordered to refrain from political activity.  Also, television pictures and still photographs of political unrest, or police  action to quell that unrest, remain illegal. That rule, however, has not been  fully enforced in recent months.    Q: Does this mean the United States will end its sanctions against South  Africa?    A: Not yet. South Africa has met some of the conditions required by U.S. law to  suspend or modify its sanctions against Pretoria. But several conditions  remain, including the release of Mandela and an end to the state of emergency.    Q: What does the ANC say now?    A: The ANC is still trying to decide how to respond to De Klerk's moves. Its  initial statements have indicated it welcomes the reforms but thinks they do  not go far enough.    Q: What are the remaining ANC conditions for negotiations?    A: The ANC is still demanding that the government release all political  prisoners, including those -- such as Mandela -- convicted of violent crimes;  lift the state of emergency and get rid of other laws designed to curtail  political activity, and remove all army troops from the black townships.    Q: Will the ANC give up its armed struggle against the white minority-led  government?    A: The ANC says it will not end its guerrilla war until the South African  government ends its armed actions against ANC operatives. The ANC says a mutual  cease-fire is something that can be negotiated with the government eventually.    Q: How strong is the right-wing movement, and what does it plan to do?    A: The right-wing Conservative Party, which supports apartheid, won 31% of the  white votes in the last general election and remains the government's official  opposition in Parliament. While the Conservatives do not have enough votes to  stop De Klerk's liberalizing moves in Parliament, they plan to begin staging  public protest marches and rallies to put pressure on the government to stop  its process of reform. Other white extremist groups who are not represented in  Parliament are small, but some fear they will become increasingly militant in  the face of South Africa's changes.    Q: Does apartheid remain in force?    A: Yes. The pillars of apartheid are not affected by De Klerk's announcement.  They include the Group Areas Act, which segregates neighborhoods; the Land Act,  which prohibits blacks from owning property in most areas of the country, and  the Population Registration Act, which classifies all South Africans by race.    Q: When will those apartheid laws be repealed?    A: The government says it plans to repeal soon the Separate Amenities Act,  which allows communities to segregate public facilities such as swimming pools,  recreation halls, parks and restrooms. Public facilities in larger cities in  South Africa have been integrated in recent years, but segregated facilities  remain in many rural towns. The government has given no indication that it  plans to remove the other laws any time soon.    Q: If negotiations begin, how far apart will the ANC and the government be in  their visions of a new constitution?    A: The government says it is willing to share power with blacks as long as the  interests of the white minority, outnumbered 5 to 1, are protected. The ANC, on  the other hand, wants a one-man, one-vote system leading to majority rule,  which would almost certainly mean a government led primarily by blacks.    Q: When will Mandela be released?    A: President De Klerk says he has decided to release Mandela soon but that no  date has been set.

In fact they sang to him, belting out the Broadway show tune turned British  soccer standard ""You'll Never Walk Alone"" for anti-apartheid leader Nelson  Mandela.    The exuberant but extremely well-behaved crowd of more than 70,000 had no  problem adjusting to the nearly seamless blend of politics and music at the  five-hour Mandela tribute concert Monday night.    The same fans who went crazy over Simple Minds and formed a 150-person conga  line during Natalie Cole's ""Wild Women Do"" paid rapt attention to all the  political speeches, especially Mandela's. During his low-key, half-hour  appearance, the African National Congress leader gave his thanks for the  international efforts which helped win his release after nearly three decades  of imprisonment and pleaded for continued sanctions against the South African  government.    The crowd cheered, hissed and kept quiet at all the right times.    With this concert, it appeared that the use of grandiose rock shows for  consciousness-raising purposes had evolved another notch. This was no  fund-raising charity event. Though the artists were performing for free, other  productions costs were high, according to the organizers, and they expect to  see little, if any profit.

In fact they sang to him, belting out the Broadway show tune turned British  soccer standard ""You'll Never Walk Alone"" for anti-apartheid leader Nelson  Mandela.    The exuberant but extremely well-behaved crowd of more than 70,000 had no  problem adjusting to the nearly seamless blend of politics and music at the  five-hour Mandela tribute concert Monday night.    The same fans who went crazy over Simple Minds and formed a 150-person conga  line during Natalie Cole's ""Wild Women Do"" paid rapt attention to all the  political speeches, especially Mandela's. During his low-key, half-hour  appearance, the African National Congress leader gave his thanks for the  international efforts which helped win his release after nearly three decades  of imprisonment and pleaded for continued sanctions against the South African  government.    The crowd cheered, hissed and kept quiet at all the right times.    With this concert, it appeared that the use of grandiose rock shows for  consciousness-raising purposes had evolved another notch. This was no  fund-raising charity event. Though the artists were performing for free, other  productions costs were high, according to the organizers, and they expect to  see little, if any profit. Instead it was designed to provide a worldwide forum  for a political cult hero to deliver his message. This new dimension in pop  music events brought occasional moments of culture clash.

At the rally, Mr Mandela told thousands of supporters that  senior state officials were perpetrating violence. The ANC  leader also charged that the NP was fomenting violence. ""I hope  that before April 27 there will be sufficient evidence to show  that there is a `third force',"" said Mr Mandela.

""It is common knowledge that the ANC itself is involved in  by  far the majority of cases of violence and intimidation  throughout the country.""

0,FT933-10312 ,"FT933-10312 _AN-DHECDAAIFT 930805   FT  05 AUG 93 / Secret service scandal seizes the Czech imagination: Patrick Blum on charges of the sale of confidential information      By PATRICK BLUM   THE indictment last week by a Prague military court of a secret service agent threatens to open a corruption scandal involving the Czech Republic's secret service, a maverick businessman and leading politicians. All have been drawn into a web of allegations made by Mr Vaclav Wallis, a 48-year-old former member of the StB, the communist secret police. Mr Wallis is awaiting trial on charges of selling private and economic information gathered by the secret services before and after the 'velvet' revolution which overthrew communism in 1989. The scandal has been fed by a daily diet of news and 'revelations' which has occupied the front pages of local newspapers since Mr Wallis's indictment, leading to intense speculation over exactly what and who are involved. Czech television last week said these included confidential information on the government's privatisation programme, as well as potentially compromising information on the private lives of senior Czech politicians, including President Vaclav Havel and Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus. The information is said to have been gathered by the StB, and later by the Federal Security Information Service (FBIS) established in 1991 to replace the hated StB, and collected within a special file of 'Personalities in Political and Economic Life'. The FBIS itself was succeeded by a new Security Information Service (BIS) at the end of last year, not long before the break-up of the former Czechoslovakia into separate Czech and Slovak states. Critics say it continues to harbour many former employees of the FBIS and its Stalinist predecessor. The recipient of at least part of this information was Mr Viktor Kozeny, a controversial young entrepreneur and head of Harvard Capital and Consulting (HCC) - one of the country's largest voucher privatisation funds whose shareholdings have an estimated book value of about Dollars 600m and a market value more than double that. Mr Kozeny admits he paid up to Kcs500,000 (Pounds 12,000) to Mr Wallis, but he says this was because Mr Wallis was blackmailing him by threatening to reveal damaging information about himself and his business. In a statement on Tuesday, Mr Kozeny said: 'I was blackmailed by a man whose real function as employee of this institution (the FBIS) was not known to me. Neither I nor Harvard Fund have anything to hide.' Mr Wallis says he supplied the information - including information gathered by the FBIS on HCC - at Mr Kozeny's request. According to CTK, the Czech news agency, the information was passed on to Mr Kozeny between March and December 1992. Mr Wallis was arrested on December 7 while passing information to and accepting Kcs100,000 in payment from Mr Kozeny, who had informed the FBIS. Mr Wallis was indicted on charges of abuse of public office and divulging state secrets and faces up to 10 years in jail if found guilty. Mr Kozeny is the main witness in the case against Mr Wallis and faces no charges himself. Mr Kozeny, who set up HCC with Dollars 3,000 to make it a major shareholder of some of the Czech Republic's most important financial institutions and companies, has faced controversy before. HCC was investigated by the secret police in 1991, and in January last year, Lidove Noviny, a respected daily newspaper, revealed that several of its employees were former StB and interior ministry officials. Mr Kozeny's rapid success and somewhat brash style have made him many enemies as well as admirers among Prague's small business and political community. At the weekend, several newspapers questioned Mr Kozeny's version of events, and Lidove Noviny said it was unusual for a blackmailer to make gifts even in the shape of confidential information to the person he was blackmailing. Local observers believe the scandal is the most visible sign yet of a growing web of corruption which involves former communist officials, organised crime, politicians and businessmen. Mr Jiri Dienstbier, former dissident and foreign minister after the revolution, last week said: 'The Wallis affair is like the tip of the iceberg of a whole system of corruption which is spreading here.' The Wallis affair, as it is now known, follows a smaller scandal involving the illegal sale of personal data on 2m Czechs from the interior ministry's central registry to a private company which, it was alleged, promptly sold it to Procter and Gamble for an advertising campaign.

McBride, who planted a  bomb at Magoo's Bar in Durban, is the second most popular  candidate on the ANC's list. The AVF has called McBride a mass  murderer. It says his popularity follows what the AVF calls the  already alarming reemergence of convicted kidnapper Winnie  Mandela. ANC spokesman Carl Niehaus says McBride is working  hard for peace:    [Begin Niehaus recording] Comrade McBride is making a very  important contribution to work for peace in the eastern parts of  Johannesburg, and he has been particularly strongly involved in  helping to work for peace in areas such as Thokoza and  Katlehong. In contrast the AVF, and specific members of that  Volksfront, has consistently, despite the fact that they have  the right to participate in negotiations, despite the fact that  those people that they represent have throughout the history of  this country had the vote, threatened with violence and with  civil war.

Mandela, speaking to journalists at the end of a two-day  visit to the Netherlands, said the threats of violence from  black and white parties in the Alliance were greatly  exaggerated, and it was not in a position to go to war.    The African National Congress leader said: ""We must not  exaggerate the importance of the organisations in the Freedom  Alliance. We don't even think that they have the capacity to  conduct a civil war.""    He did not believe the boycott threat was final, but even if  it was carried out it would not stop the election process.    A series of meetings were held Friday in Johannesburg by  both  the ANC and the government to try to convince the Freedom  Alliance to accept a last-minute compromise package and join the  April 26 to 28 election.    The package is set to be approved by a recalled multi-party  forum on Monday, before going to a special sitting of  parliament, probably in early March, to be passed into law.     "

The prosecutor recommended 34 months in jail for speaker  Hsiao Teng-wang and five years for Deputy Speaker Chen Chun-kui  for vote- buying if they are found guilty.    An investigation showed that Hsiao and Chen had offered NT$1  [new Taiwan dollars] million (US$37,878) and NT$800,000,  respectively, to each councilor who would vote for them.    The prosecutor also proposed a jail term of two years for  councilors Chang Tung-kun and Li Tien-lang, who were suspected  of buying votes on behalf of Hsiao and Chen.    Eleven other people face proposed jail terms of between  eight  months and 18 months for their roles in the nation's worst  election scandal.    At least 360 people around Taiwan, including 13 speakers,  nine deputy speakers and 185 councilors, have so far been  indicted on graft charges as the investigation into the scandal  continues to unfold.    The Chiayi County Council on Monday emerged unscathed from  the scandal when the Chiayi prosecutor's office concluded an  investigation into the election of the council with nobody being  charged.    The ruling Kuomintang won all 23 city and county speaker  positions at stake in the polls.     "

""The country at large has  been caught up in social turbulance since Sharpeville, since  before Mr Mandela went to jail. and the backwash swirls around  him: unrealistic expectations, lingering angers and spites,  destructive behaviour designed to make a country ungovernable  rather than to make it succeed, and habits of dependency,  resentment and irresponsibility."" And the ""greatest threat to  the future"" is the ""flight of capital, the wariness of investors  that arise from perceptions of crime, random violence, labor  indiscipline, rampant white-collar crime, fiscal profligacy,  ostentatious mandarism and all the other social ills the country  inherits from the NP [National Party]."" ""Mr Mandela's first  challenge is to set a different tone"" and deal with a civil  service ""adept at looting, a parasite class."" ""Mr Mandela is the  only leader in a generation who has had the moral stature to  call this nation back to work, to impose a stern discipline and  to command patience. He should not hesitate to impose on his  administration his own instincts for order, frugality and  propriety.""    SUNDAY NATION    Vigilance -- Following the inauguration last week, this  country is ""bound together with a sense of optimism about the  future,"" ""the unfolding process could certainly represent a  genuine change of fortune for the country -- but only if some of  the basic needs of the deprived majority see signs that their  vote is working for them to usher a new era,"" an editorial in  Johannesburg NEW NATION in English on May 15 on page 10 states.  Strikes in Transkei, Bophuthatswana and among Eastern and  Western Cape interpreters ""mark the beginning of many tests  which our newly-found freedom will be subjected to"" and ""further  trouble could either be contained or be allowed to spread to  areas like Ciskei, Venda, Lebowa and even Qwaqwa."" ""It is true  that in our newly-attained democracy, the right to strike is  part of the workers' democratic right in order to achieve their  desired result. But this should take place in a disciplined  fashion."" ""Our liberation was a costly one and we need to defend  it with everything at our disposal. Should we relax, we should  know that we are sitting on a powder keg which will consume all.""    BEELD    RSA Can Be Rainbow of Hope -- ""Yesterday at the Union  Buildings the world was witness to the formal birth of a new  South Africa committed to justice, peace, and dignity for all  its people,"" says a page 12 editorial in the Johannesburg BEELD  in Afrikaans of 11 May. ""President Nelson Mandela said after his  inauguration before world leaders that we are a rainbow nation  which has made peace with itself and the world. The leaders who  cheered his statement are now morally bound to help make the new  South Africa a success in its growth and development. But their  role is limited. The lead will still have to be given by  President Mandela and deputy Presidents F. W. de Klerk and Thabo  Mbeki. However, ""they cannot tackle the great task ahead alone.  There rests on the shoulders of all of us a great  responsibility. The people who set aside their grievances to  stand peacefully and patiently in line to vote will now have to  work hard to maintain peace and reconciliation, and make South  Africa a country of security and prosperity for all its people.""  ""If South Africa can achieve success, it will be a rainbow of  hope and promise to the rest of the world.""    Constsructive U. S. Approach Welcomed -- A second editorial  on page 12 of BEELD argues: ""The presence in South Africa of a  high level U. S. government delegation led by Vice President Al  Gore, First Lady Hillary Clinton, and Trade Secretary Ron Brown  is more significant that it would appear on the surface. Not  only do they represent the most senior U. S. delegation yet to  visit South Africa; their visit follows shortly after the  announcement of the `Clinton Plan' of economic and social  upliftment for South Africa involving 2.16 billion rands over  the next 3 years. It also follows on the U. S. President's  earlier initiative to encourage his private sector to invest in  the new South Africa. It is therefore clear that the Clinton  administration is busy putting words into action and reaching  out a helping hand as no recent U. S. administration has done.  This -- hopefully with the enthusiastic support of the G- 7  countries -- could provide the spark which the South African  economic engine desperately needs, and which could eventually  contribute to sustained growth. This new, constructive approach  is most welcome.""    Police Now Serve Accepted Government -- A third editorial on  the same page quotes Archbishop Desmond Tutu's statement in Cape  Town on Monday that the police deserve praise for their role  that day, and his reference to them as ""our police."" BEELD  continues: ""These words by Bishop Tutu encapsulate the positive  new dynamic which is moving into so many areas of South African  society."" ""That Bishop Tutu can now, together with all South  Africans, speak of `our police' is not due to changes to the  force, but is due to the birth of the new constitutional  dispensation. The police are no longer enforcing the laws of a  minority government, but of a generally accepted government of  all South Africa. There is still a long road ahead for the  development of real loyalty to institutions of authority and new  symnbols. It can be achieved. A divided nations needs to heal  the wounds of the past in order to strengthen itself. In fact,  it's not only `our police' or `our defene force' or `our flag,'  it's `our country.'""     "

Dr. Buthelezi said that advocates of a federal  system in South Africa have been elbowed out of negotiations by  the government and the ANC.    The government and the ANC have both indicated that they  intend to be accommodating of the Zulu king's position. Before  the summit meeting begins, Mr. Mandela will hold separate talks  with King Goodwill on the kwaZulu issue. Yesterday Mr. Mandela  and President de Klerk held preparatory discussions.

The district nursing officer, Sister Winnie Fadzai  Mavedzenge, last week said incidences of sexually transmitted  diseases among schoolchildren, which recently represented about  60 percent of recorded cases, had been ""reduced tremendously.""    She attributed the reduction to a vigorous anti-AIDS  awareness campaign which sparked off a ""condom riot"" at  Gutu-Mupandawana growth point as people dropped unprotected sex.    ""People are coming on their own to collect condoms which we  have flooded in all night spots at the growth point,"" she said.  Cde. Mavedzenge said STD had tumbled down to fourth on the list  of problem diseases in Gutu after acute respiratory infections,  injuries, and skin diseases since the launch in 1990.    The Ministry of Health and Child Welfare went on the  offensive following reports of mounting STD and HIV cases in the  district of nearly 200,000 people.    Under a recently unveiled knowledge, attitudes and practices  programme, public health officers studied socio-economic  profiles of vulnerable groups such as schoolchildren housed in  illegal boarding camps before prescribing durable solutions.    ""We told the heads of schools that all pupils not housed in  proper boarding places had to go back to their villages where  they fall under their parents' authority,"" she said.    In 1989, Gutu was shocked when the then district medical  officer, Dr. David Blankhart, said that at least 100 patients in  Gutu Mission Hospital had tested HIV positive.    Although his statistics were holy disputed, the spiral of  infection continued to rise sharply as no fewer than 2,000 STD  cases were recorded per year in the district between 1991 and  1993.    Sister Mavedzenge, however, said since the launch of the  campaign, numbers of ""ladies of easy virtue"" had dwindled  considerably at Gutu-Mupandawana owing largely to a rapidly  disappearing clientele.

That, says  State President F.W. de Klerk and ANC [African National  Congress] leader Nelson Mandela, is the success recipe other  political leaders should use to make free and fair elections  possible in South Africa. Agreements or proposals during  today's crucial meeting were not, however, released to the  media. Mr. De Klerk and Mr. Mandela confirmed that a  comprehensive anti-violence plan containing ANC proposals and  government initiatives would be drawn up.    [Begin recording] [Reporter Gary Alfonso] After four hours  of  critical talks at the Union Buildings in Pretoria, Mr. de Klerk  and Mr. Mandela emerged to say, against media expectation, that  the government and the ANC had formulated a joint plan to curb  violence. Although both leaders agreed not to release sensitive  details to the media, they again condemned recent senseless  attacks such as the Katlehong shooting. They, however,  confirmed that future efforts to end the carnage in troubled  areas would have to be facilitated through strong  community-based projects.    [De Klerk] A very strong action, coupled also with solution-  orientated and community-orientated actions will be necessary  and we will be focusing, in the days to come, very strongly --  now having had also the important input from the ANC's side.  Secondly, we discussed the constitutional situation and the  need for further interaction with the Freedom Alliance. We are  thinking inclusively. We want the significant parties within the  Freedom Alliance to become part of the process.    [Mandela] The progress that we have made today is a very  encouraging one. That crisis will emerge if Mr. de Klerk  remains deaf to the proposals that I am making, but from what  has happened today it does appear that we are making very good  progress.    [Alfonso] Referring to the breakdown in talks with  right-wing  negotiators, Mr. Mandela remained firm on the impossibility of a  volkstaat [homeland] for Afrikaners, but said he hoped the  right- wing would prefer dialogue to civil war.    [Mandela] I urged Ferdie Hartzenberg yesterday that he must  heed -- and his colleagues -- must refrain from inciting that  section of the Afrikaners who want a separate homeland -- that  they must avoid the situation where that section is going to be  isolated and become the target for the anger of the majority of  the people of South Africa, black and white.    [Alfonso] Mr. de Klerk confirmed that the government had  proof that extreme right-wing elements had been involved in  various incidents of township violence.    [De Klerk] From time to time right-wing people are directly  involved in specific incidents and evidence has been uncovered  and, therefore, we must assume that there are elements in their  ranks who are involved in violent actions    [Alfonso] Both leaders have agreed to meet again next week  to  discuss and finalize the joint strategy against violence and  other constitutional issues.

Castro  attended Mandela's inauguration ceremony in Pretoria yesterday.    Early this morning, Castro visited Mandela at Mandela's  official residence, where they talked behind closed doors. In  remarks to the press yesterday, Castro said new possibilities  for cooperation between the two countries are opening up, as the  African National Congress assumes power. He added that because  of the ties of friendship and affection that exist between the  two countries, with no other country in the world are there such  broad possibilities for cooperation as there are between South  Africa and Cuba.    After meeting with Mandela, Castro granted the South African  Broadcasting Corporation, the local television network, an  exclusive interview at the Arcadia Hotel, where he and all the  members of his top-level delegation are staying.    Regarding his first visit to South Africa, whose army fought  Cuban troops in the struggle for the independence of Angola and  Namibia, Castro said there are two South Africas and two moments  in the history of South Africa. He said there was a moment of  strong confrontations but that now there is a new South Africa,  where there is peace, respect, and affection toward Cuba.     "

Nelson Mandela is about to visit Los Angeles and the national NAACP leadership  will meet here next week. These twin events put into focus the relationship  between blacks in South Africa and in the United States. The differences in how  these two communities have responded to racism extend far beyond the fact that  one is an oppressed majority and the other is a discrete minority.    Ironically, the Cold War was a significant factor in eroding Jim Crow in the  United States and in encouraging the onset of apartheid in South Africa. How  could Washington continue howling about human-rights violations in the Soviet  Union when most African Americans could not vote or eat at certain lunch  counters or be buried in some cemeteries? Simultaneously, Washington's search  for allies in this global struggle allowed the ruling party in Pretoria to  promulgate apartheid in 1948, proclaiming the African National Congress a  veritable tool of Moscow. Then as now, the ANC was allied with the South  African Communist Party and Washington lent a sympathetic ear to the  government.    The NAACP had not been indifferent to the U.S. Communist Party in the pre-Cold  War era. Many of its leaders, especially Roy Wilkins, lent support to the black  Communist lawyer Ben Davis when he was elected to the New York City Council  from Harlem in 1943 and 1945. But unlike the ANC, the NAACP broke these ties in  the postwar period; hence, founder W.E.B. Du Bois was ousted in 1948, the group  supported wars in Korea and Vietnam and barred Communists from membership as  part of a de facto Faustian bargain that led to concessions on civil rights.  The ANC chose not to take this path.    The consequences of the NAACP's choice resonate to this day. With the left  still marginalized among blacks (not to mention the nation as a whole), black  youth in particular face unpalatable choices. One is a pallid integrationism  that has the virtue of organizing across racial lines. But the absence of  militance provides little appeal for youth, who recognize that militance has  historically been the engine bringing gains to our community. The other is a  narrow nationalism, symbolized by the throngs greeting the Rev. Louis  Farrakhan, that is verbally militant but is self-defeating in its lack of  organization, a historical approach and chauvinism. Eastern Europe is now  discovering the lesson learned ruefully by blacks, that decline of the left  leads to the rise of narrow nationalism.    Though racism in South Africa is more severe than it is here, Farrakhan's  sexism and anti-white rhetoric would be viewed with far greater skepticism in  Soweto. Similarly, the NAACP's anti-communism would receive outraged disbelief.    When Mandela was freed, he singled out for special praise the Communist Party  and its leader, Joe Slovo, who is of Lithuanian-Jewish descent and who has  quite a following in black South Africa. Meanwhile, U.S. youth are captivated  by rap groups like Public Enemy, which engage in anti-Semitic allusions.    When the left was marginalized in the United States, along with it went the  idea that racism stemmed from profit and the operations of a system. It became  inevitable that blacks, seeking new explanations for their plight, would blame  Euro-Americans as a whole.    The ANC speaks explicitly of redistribution of wealth; despite the significant  disparities of wealth that also exist in the United States, this demand is  curiously absent from the agendas of most civil rights organizations. Indeed,  the NAACP was reluctant to take up the cause of the anti-apartheid movement  because of its allergy to the left, and relented only recently.    It would be simpleminded to blame just the NAACP for this sad state of affairs.  Powerful elites backed its leaders into this corner. But Nelson Mandela and the  ANC also faced powerful enemies and decided to stare them down; now they are on  the verge of taking over a government and a sizeable state-owned economy with  the aim of improving the well-being of the black majority. Meanwhile, African  Americans face an uncertain future as the scientific and technological  revolution has undermined a major base of livelihood -- factory jobs -- while  our crumbling system of education is not preparing blacks for an increasingly  gloomy tomorrow.    Nelson Mandela represents the road not taken, though it is still not too late  for the NAACP and other civil rights organizations to learn from his example.

He said in a SABC [South African  Broadcasting Corporation] television interview such a move  would lead to other ethnic groups demanding their own separate  entities and the break up the country.    ""(We) will be breaking up South Africa into a number of  different political entities which will destroy the economy,"" he  said. ""We are against an ethnic solution,"" he said, adding  granting Afrikaners their demand for a volkstaat would inspire  other groups whose homelands have been reincorporated into South  Africa presenting similar claims.

He also said  his organisation would press ahead with efforts to persuade the  Freedom Alliance to take part in the forthcoming elections.    The Inkatha Freedom Party has announced it will not take  part.    Asked to state his message to South Africans, Mr Mandela  called for reconciliation.

On Nov. 27, Michael Johns, the policy analyst for Third World and African  affairs for the Heritage Foundation, testified before the U.N. Committee on  Apartheid. He did not meet with a critical reception because Johns has for many  years been a voluble critic of apartheid, so that it was not thought necessary  to pass much time on the disavowalist rituals. What Johns pleaded for, and  flatly predicted, was that the West would remove its sanctions against South  Africa ""as early as in February or March.""    This would have sounded very rash, except that from inside South Africa we hear  now from Nelson Mandela, widely accepted as the patron saint of economic  sanctions. What Mandela is saying is that perhaps the time has come to  ""reconsider"" their appropriateness. For him to say even that much dilutes the  moral absolutism of the call to sanctions, the kind of thing that Bishop Trevor  Huddleston of Britain has made his militant cause for many years.    Johns recited statistics that were not effectively challenged by the U.N.  committee. He said that ""combined unemployment and underemployment figures for  South Africa's black majority now stand at 47%, largely because South Africa --  an export-driven economy -- has been denied access to many foreign markets."" He  then went on to cite the latest Gallup poll addressed to South Africa's black  majority: Do you oppose sanctions as a means for ending apartheid? Opposed:  82%.    In South Africa today, most political forces are harnessed to move toward a  general election. The exact shape of the new constitution is not yet  established, but President Frederik W. de Klerk has said that it will include  ""a universal franchise: No domination (of one race by another); equality before  an independent judiciary, (and) the protection of minorities as well as of  individual rights.""    It remains to be seen whether the Boer voters of South Africa, who are the  backbone of what is left of apartheid, will feel that the new constitution will  secure their lives, liberty and property. There will be heavy debate within the  white community when the time comes.    This much we know, but we have not reflected on the debate that is bound to  engage the black community. And that community's two principal leaders are  Nelson Mandela of the African National Congress and Zulu Chief Mangosuthu  Gatsha Buthelezi of the Inkatha movement. And obviously Mandela is asking  himself whether he wishes to engage in a voting contest against a black leader  who opposes sanctions at a time when almost one-half of the black population is  unemployed or underemployed.    The events of the past year or two in South Africa have been almost as dramatic  as those in Eastern Europe, and they are by no means unrelated to those events.  As long as the ANC was thought by the white population and the white government  to be the arm of a Soviet state systematically engaged in oppression, violence  and subversion, the congress was rightly suppressed. The decision to free  Mandela coincided with the conviction that the steam had run out of the  communist revolution and that the ANC's continuing link to international  communism was something on the order of sentimental historical formality,  unrelated to any potential to do revolutionary damage. It could be said that  when the wall went down in Berlin, so it did in South Africa, between the  government and the primary black party of dissent.    What we have to fear is the bitter-enders who would really prefer a  non-peaceful end to the South African story. Three years ago in London, Bishop  Huddleston, the honorary chairman of the anti-apartheid movement, said, ""I  would never suggest civil war is welcome; I say it is inevitable."" The hatred  of apartheid and of its sponsors has not been entirely appeased by the collapse  of apartheid. There is sentiment among such as Bishop Huddleston for vengeance.  One way in which that vengeance could be satisfied is by a constitution that  has the effect of jeopardizing the security of white-owned property. Another  would seek that civil war of which the bishop spoke.    In the next months, the debate will open on sanctions. It will be interesting  to see how the fundamentalists react. Will Harvard reinvest in South Africa?  Will the Third World powers in the United Nations heed the revised judgment of  Mandela? Or will he be branded an opportunistic Uncle Tom? Worth watching,  particularly by those who do not believe that a civil war in South Africa would  please anybody this side of the good bishop.

It could be said that  when the wall went down in Berlin, so it did in South Africa, between the  government and the primary black party of dissent.    What we have to fear is the bitter-enders who would really prefer a  non-peaceful end to the South African story. Three years ago in London, Bishop  Huddleston, the honorary chairman of the anti-apartheid movement, said, ""I  would never suggest civil war is welcome; I say it is inevitable."" The hatred  of apartheid and of its sponsors has not been entirely appeased by the collapse  of apartheid. There is sentiment among such as Bishop Huddleston for vengeance.  One way in which that vengeance could be satisfied is by a constitution that  has the effect of jeopardizing the security of white-owned property. Another  would seek that civil war of which the bishop spoke.    In the next months, the debate will open on sanctions. It will be interesting  to see how the fundamentalists react. Will Harvard reinvest in South Africa?  Will the Third World powers in the United Nations heed the revised judgment of  Mandela? Or will he be branded an opportunistic Uncle Tom? Worth watching,  particularly by those who do not believe that a civil war in South Africa would  please anybody this side of the good bishop.      Opinion    "

The official inauguration of  the Republic of South Africa's new president, Nelson Mandela,  will take place here Tuesday 10 May. [passage omitted]    Russia will not be represented even by the premier.  Admittedly, Russia's Foreign Ministry has issued a statement  expressing a ""sense of profound satisfaction"" at the restoration  of racial and social justice in the RSA and voicing hope for the  further development of the good relations that have taken shape  between our countries. It is, however, appropriate to note that  these relations have taken shape only over the last two and a  half years, while previously the USSR and the RSA were separated  by a thick curtain of mutual hostility and enmity.    However, there were long-standing friendly ties between the  CPSU Central Committee and the ANC and in particular with the  Communist Party, which was considered one of the most dogmatic  and obedient to Moscow in the world communist movement. Money  and weapons passed down secret channels at Soviet taxpayers'  expense for the ""liberation struggle"" in South Africa. Groups  of gunmen were trained on USSR territory. Perestroyka put an  end to all that. And when reforms began in the RSA as well,  links with the ""friends"" were put on ice.    At the start of the breakup of the USSR the then Soviet  leadership just did not care about the RSA. The Kremlin forgot  to telephone Mandela when he came out of jail. U.S. President  George Bush's telephone call of congratulations was virtually  the first. The ANC leader's trip to Moscow failed to take place  five times. The invitation from Mikhail Gorbachev was either  awkwardly sent at a time when it was known that Mandela was  leaving on another foreign trip or Moscow refused to host the  South African visitor owing to internal disarray.    It is to Mandela's credit that he never made digs at the  former ""luminary of socialism."" He only remarked when he was  given the Nobel Peace Prize last year that the only country that  has always helped the ANC is Norway. On the other hand South  Africa's Communists abused Gorbachev roundly, in August 1991  they congratulated the putschists, and they blatantly expressed  solidarity with the Supreme Soviet in its opposition to Russia's  president. The ANC and the Communist Party in unison with  Russia's Communists protested the establishment of diplomatic  relations with the RSA and President De Klerk's visit [to  Russia].    Now that the ANC has come to power Moscow has to organize  relations from scratch. I do not think that South African  Communists, influential within the ANC leadership, will change  their views of the democratic transformations within Russia.  But one can hope for pragmatism from the new RSA president.  [passage omitted]     "

Mr Mandela, on a four-day visit to Britain, said an ANC-led government would offer fiscal incentives to persuade investors to set up plants and joint-venture companies in deprived areas of South Africa. Addressing business leaders in Birmingham, ahead of a conference on the South African economy in London today, he highlighted the northern Cape and black homelands such as Transkei as areas where international companies should launch subsidiary operations. 'There will be tax incentives for the next five years and other strategies to ensure we spread the benefits of investment to the poorest areas,' he said. Mr Mandela said the incentives, part of an investment code drawn up by the ANC, did not involve an obligation on companies to invest only in areas of high unemployment and social deprivation. They would form the centrepiece of an appeal to foreign investors to help equalise economic disparities between black and white communities. The investment code also guaranteed that overseas companies could repatriate profits and dividends. But he warned large-scale state intervention was unavoidable to overcome structural problems in the South African economy.   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.

Mr Mandela, who arrived in London shortly after President F W de Klerk left for Denmark on the second leg of his three-nation European visit, also expressed his opposition to the planned visit to South Africa later this year by Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary. Speaking at a press conference after the hour-long session with Mr Major, the first meeting between the two men, Mr Mandela said that Pretoria should be kept isolated and under pressure during negotiations for a post-apartheid South Africa. British officials said that Mr Major stressed that he and the ANC leader shared a common objective - the ending of apartheid - but maintained that lifting sanctions encouraged the reform process. At the press conference, Mr Mandela repeated his threat to break off talks with Pretoria on May 9 if President de Klerk did not take further steps to end township violence. In Denmark, Mr de Klerk failed to persuade parliamentarians to back the European Community's recent decision in principle to lift the embargo on imports of South African iron, steel and gold coins. The minority Conservative government led by Mr Minister Poul Schluter, who was due to meet Mr de Klerk, is unable to enact Community policy without the approval of the Danish parliament. Conservatives argue that Pretoria should be rewarded for its reforms, but opposition parties in parliament's Market Affairs Committee, led by the Social Democrats, won a vote to maintain sanctions against South Africa. In theory, Denmark can exercise an effective veto over implementation of the Community decision to lift sanctions. But Community officials suggested yesterday that in practice continued Danish opposition would do no more than cause a delay.  The Financial Times   London Page 4  "

Mr Takashi Hashimoto, 57, a vice-president of Taisei, was arrested for his alleged role in the bribery of a local governor who, prosecutors say, accepted Y20m (Pounds 122,600) from the company on the understanding it would be awarded public works contracts. Taisei said last week that two provincial managers arrested for the alleged bribery of Mr Shuntaro Honma, the governor of Miyagi, north of Tokyo, had acted without the approval of head office, apparently prompting the prosecutors to take aim at the company again. The company yesterday apologised for the embarrassment caused by the case, though it insisted that executives had merely given a political donation to Mr Honma, whose resignation was accepted by the Miyagi prefectural assembly yesterday. Executives from five of Japan's largest contractors have been arrested in the past three months, and the scandal has forced the government to review the selection process for public works contracts. But Construction Ministry officials say the unfolding scandal could slow the award of construction projects commissioned under the government spending packages intended to stimulate a weakening economy. Prosecutors appear to be shifting their investigation to national politicians with close ties to the construction industry, particularly members of the Liberal Democratic party and ex-members of the party who joined the government coalition of Mr Morihiro Hosokawa.

It was also obvious that two of the most important players  in  the African National Congress had been sidelined, deliberately  or systematically. ANC secretary-general Cyril Ramaphosa was  excluded from the cabinet of the National Assembly as it  gathered in Cape Town. Jay Naidoo, the fiery former  general-secretary of the Congress of South African Trade Unions,  is Minister Without Portfolio. While it is said Ramaphosa's  omission was at his own request, it indeed has a far-reaching  effect on the ANC-South African Communist Party-COSATU [Congress  of South African Trade Unions] alliance.    Added to that is the fact that Naidoo was tipped for the  portfolio of Minister of Manpower in the ANC government. It is  prudent, therefore, that an attempt be made to chart the power  design of the ANC alliance, as led by man-in-the-middle  President Nelson Mandela.    -- Ramaphosa shouldered the primary responsibility of  negotiating the new dispensation on behalf of his party. He was  second on the ANC list after Mandela and as such was the natural  choice for first executive Deputy President. However, the  riddle remains. Ramaphosa accepted his current post in the ANC  in 1991 on the workers' ticket. He was then general secretary of  the powerful National Union of Mineworkers [NUM] which formed  the bulk of COSATU membership.    -- Naidoo once intimated in an interview that he was the  person most employers loved to hate. And he was depicted in  some newspaper cartoons as the devil incarnate, complete with  horns. It was, after all, COSATU that designed the ANC's  Reconstruction and Development Programme [RDP]. Therefore,  argument is that the RDP was watered down considerably before  being accepted. This indicates trade unionists, or workers, in  the alliance were being pressured down for pushing hardline  economic policies. The fact of the matter is that COSATU  bolstered the ANC election campaign when it agreed to fight the  poll under its banner. There are other pertinent factors to the  ANC power design, namely, the ANC's internal wing during its  twilight years in exile.    -- The United Democratic Front [UDF] held the movement's  banner, especially bringing to a head the country's politics in  the mid-1980s. While it is not surprising that important former  UDF leaders Popo Molefe and Patrick Lekota were nominated for  premier posts, it becomes clearer that this sector of the  broader ANC movement was being appeased, or accommodated, in the  power design.    Molefe is premier for the Northwest province, while Lekota  heads the [Orange] Free State parliament. The two men were  instrumental in resistance campaigns, which saw them being  jailed in the marathon Delmas Trial in the aftermath of the 1984  anti-high rent unrest in Vaal Triangle townships. The argument  goes even further.    -- The appointment by Mandela of aging former ANC  secretary-general Alfred Nzo to the post of Minister of Foreign  Affairs has been met with wide criticism. Debate surrounding  his appointment, albeit political, emphasises another attempt to  accommodate the ANC's former exiled leadership in the cabinet.  Charismatic Thabo Mbeki, executive Deputy President-elect,  falls in this category even though he was favoured for the  Foreign Ministry portfolio. Dr Pallo Jordan was the obvious  choice for Minister of Information as head of the ANC's  department of information and publicity.    -- Then there is the ANC's ""old guard"" -- Mandela's men, so  to speak. Here one refers to the Rivonia trialists, but the  only conspicuous appointment is that of Govan Mbeki as Eastern  Cape premier. Poignantly, if workers within the ANC alliance  were to ally themselves with the Ramaphosa-Naidoo cabal -- which  is not formal, perhaps not yet -- a powerful anti-ANC party on  the workers' ticket could emerge. But it is Ramaphosa who will  be in focus post-May 10. He has yet to explain why he  ""requested"" not to be in the cabinet as Mandela announces his  men and women in government in Pretoria tomorrow. It is also  widely believed Ramaphosa turned down the offer of Foreign  Minister after he failed to become Deputy President.    Another argument, however, is that although he did a fine  job  as NUM general-secretary there is a view among the ANC youth  leaders that he was not really in ""the struggle"" because he  negotiated with management in the comfort of boardrooms.  Indeed, as the celebrations end and after Mandela has  reluctantly sipped the ugly-smelling stuff called champagne at  the Union Buildings in Pretoria, Cyril Ramaphosa and Jay Naidoo  will be the men to watch.

Prosecutors said Dollars 40m was diverted in the largest case of fraud ever under a US government programme to finance sales of military equipment by American companies to foreign governments. The company admitted four counts of conspiracy, money laundering, submitting false claims and failure to make and keep accurate books and records. In June the Pentagon's Defence Logistics Agency suspended GE Aircraft Engines, which is based near Cincinnati, for four days from competing for contracts. GE employees were alleged to have bribed an Israeli air force general to influence his choice of a contractor for military jet engines. GE, the third-largest defence contractor in the US, said it went to the authorities as soon as it became aware of alleged wrongdoing by company employees. The charges arose after Mr Chester Walsh, who was manager of GE's aircraft engine business in Israel from 1984 to 1988, brought the scheme to the government's attention. Mr Walsh filed a civil suit against GE under the Federal False Claims Act, which the Justice Department joined in August after an investigation by the FBI.  The Financial Times   London Page 4  "

These are the somewhat surprising findings of a survey of top business people conducted last month for the South African Chamber of Business, the Weekly Mail and Guardian newspaper, and the South African Broadcasting Corporation. Professor Mark Orkin of the Community Agency for Social Enquiry, who conducted the research, said it showed top business figures 'have already embraced the political future and are optimistic about the business prospects heralded by an ANC-led government'. The core finding is optimism about the future, with 85 per cent of respondents predicting an optimistic future for their children or grandchildren. In the short term, 87 per cent of respondents felt the outlook for business was improving and 71 per cent felt it would improve further after the election. The main reason offered for short-term optimism was the increased certainty and stability that would follow an election. A surprising finding was that 68 per cent of respondents said they would 'most like' Mr Mandela for president. This compared with 32 per cent for President F W de Klerk and no support for Chief Buthelezi, leader of the Inkatha Freedom party.   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.

Allan Hendrickse  has complained to the ANC [African National Congress] leadership  that he has been ""villified"" and ""kept in the dark"" about  nominations and that there is a general ""hostility"" towards his  party from certain ANC elements. In a letter to the ANC  leadership on December 21, he appealed for a ""bilateral"" on  January 12 to iron out differences. The letter, addressed to the  ""Chairman of the ANC list committee"" with copies to ANC leader  Mr. Nelson Mandela and ANC secretary-general Mr. Cyril  Ramaphosa, is the first official acknowledgement by Mr.  Hendrickse that he felt he and his party were ""unwelcome"" in ANC  ranks. This is despite the fact that Mr. Mandela included him  in his entourage to Oslo to accept the Nobel Peace Prize jointly  with State President F.W. De Klerk on December 10.    There is great division within the ANC on whether the LP,  the  main coloured party to make possible the Tricameral Parliament  -- which in turn drew fierce opposition from the Anti-Tricameral  Parliament Movement, the United Democratic Front -- should now  be taken on board the ANC election ticket. Whereas Mr. Mandela  likes the idea of having Mr. Hendrickse as a ""magnet"" to attract  coloured voters, elements within the ANC in the western Cape --  including western Cape chairman Dr. Allan Boesak -- are against  it, despite the fact the LP is a partner in the Patriotic Front  which acted as a united group during the Kempton Park  negotiations.    Because of the bad blood between the LP and ANC rank and  file  members, it came as no surprise to observers when Mr. Ramaphosa,  punted by the LP as the keynote speaker at its 28th annual  congress in Cape Town this week, never turned up. Nor was there  a single observer from the western Cape region of the ANC. The  ANC ""snub"" occurred despite Mr. Hendrickse devoting his entire  opening speech on Tuesday to urging coloured people to vote for  the ANC on April 27. The antagonism between the LP and the ANC  is clearly acknowledged by Mr. Hendrickse in his letter to the  leadership -- of which the SUNDAY TIMES has a copy -- which  reads: ""The LP of SA [South Africa] was kept in the dark about  details of the intended nomination procedure until it was too  late to prepare for regional nomination conferences. LP members  from different parts of the country eked out varying degrees of  information and each followed his own procedure. The head  committee of the LP of SA had no control over the nomination of  persons from its ranks. The LP was granted such minuscule  representation at the regional conferences and ... the hostility  towards LP members is still too great for Labour to stand a fair  chance. In the western Cape (ANC) conference, voting was  preceded by meetings where questions and statements from the  floor were provided for. This allowed people to vent their  spleen. The Labour Party was villified and condemned as  opportunists ...""     "

It gave the central government executive, in which the African National Congress is almost certain to be the leading player, overriding powers over almost all areas of provincial government. This issue, exacerbated by a dangerous mix of ethnic differences, party rivalries and personality clashes, is at the heart of the increasingly bitter dispute between Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, the Inkatha leader whose stronghold is Natal province, and Mr Nelson Mandela, the ANC president. Mr Mandela has attempted to defuse the growing crisis by offering concessions on the constitution. The ANC has dropped its opposition to provincial balloting in April, thus allowing regional leaders to prove the substantial support they claim to enjoy on their home turf. But this will be of little consequence unless it is made clearer just what power regional leaders can exercise through the provincial assemblies. Mr Mandela should make more substantial concessions in an effort to meet Chief Buthelezi's concerns. Otherwise, they might have little impact on the crisis. Nevertheless, Chief Buthelezi should also make the most of Mr Mandela's overture. A door that seemed closed is now ajar. The Inkatha leader boycotted the final rounds of the constitutional talks, arguing that the alliance between the ANC and the government allowed them to steamroller their constitutional model through the conference. At this critical stage in South Africa's history he should join in, putting his case and setting out minimum terms for ending his boycott of the April poll. For his part, Mr Mandela must give more substance to the existing constitutional blueprint and dispel suspicions that the ANC pays only lip service to the principle of decentralisation. Western countries keen to foster free elections in South Africa could help by making clear that those elections can only succeed if governed by a constitution that provides a sound foundation for democracy. An unbridgeable gap may remain at the end of the day. The ANC and the National party, having gone as far as they think they can towards meeting Chief Buthelezi's legitimate concerns, may still have to proceed without him  -facing him with the choice between conceding, in the interests of a stable South Africa, and pursuing his threat to disrupt the elections, in the name of democracy. Chief Buthelezi must now grasp what may be the last opportunity to reconcile these dangerous and deep-rooted differences peacefully.   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.

The killing, which began with clashes between Zulus and Xhosas in three  townships southeast of Johannesburg, spread Thursday to Soweto, South Africa's  largest black township. Scores of men armed with machetes and knives attacked a  commuter train and killed six people.    Later, mobs carrying weapons ranging from axes to AK-47 rifles rampaged through  Soweto's streets, and the day's death toll rose to at least 10. More than 120  were injured. Hundreds of police officers and army troops sought to impose  themselves between the warring factions, using tear gas and shotguns to break  up the crowds.    At one point, the police designated a bridge as no-man's-land between two angry  mobs as civic leaders held impromptu peace talks.

""It's frightening, I've never seen anything like it,"" Belede Mazwai, a Xhosa  mother of three, said Thursday night as a gang of Zulus with guns and spears  ran past her home in a middle-class section of Soweto. ""I just want out of this  place. The whole thing is collapsing.""    Soweto police were inundated with calls from worried residents Thursday night,  and a police dispatcher told many callers that he did not have enough officers  to send to their neighborhoods.    Late Thursday, Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok and a regional police  commander met in Soweto with Mandela and a delegation of residents in an effort  to halt the violence. There was no indication that any specific measures were  discussed or whether any plan had emerged from the earlier meeting between  Mandela and De Klerk.    ""I'm certain we're going to curb this violence,"" Brigadier Leon Mellet,  spokesman for the Law and Order Ministry, said in a televised interview. ""We're  getting more men on the ground, but we need to get the warring parties together  so we can end this violence.""    Mellet said the police believe that the week's trouble began with ""a simple  fight"" in a men's hostel in Tokoza township, where a Zulu resident killed a  Xhosa over a woman. Then, he said, ethnic animosities, rarely seen in urban  centers, were stirred by rumors, leading to violence.    The escalating unrest has presented a major challenge to the government as well  as the ANC and its rival, Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi's Zulu-based Inkatha  movement. Although the ANC is a multiracial organization, Mandela is a Xhosa  and the ANC is perceived by some to be led primarily by Xhosas.    Buthelezi blames the trouble on Mandela's refusal to meet with him. The ANC  says the violence has been caused by attempts by Buthelezi's Inkatha movement  to force non-Zulus to join its ranks.    Political analysts say the fighting is an outgrowth of three years of clashes  between supporters of Inkatha and the ANC in Buthelezi's home base of Natal  Province. More than 3,000 people have died in that feud, which has most  frequently been a battle over scarce resources between middle-class blacks who  support the ANC and those in squalid squatter settlements who support Inkatha.    Much of the fighting in Johannesburg-area townships has started in  poverty-stricken squatter camps and overcrowded hostels, to which tens of  thousands of single men, many of them Zulus, have moved from rural areas in  search of work in Johannesburg.    Leaders of the far-right Conservative Party said Thursday that the fighting  supports their theory that ethnic groups in South Africa cannot live together  peacefully.    In its statement Thursday, the ANC pleaded for calm in the townships. It said  that ""the blood of black people is flowing like rivers.""    ""Why do we butcher one another like beasts?"" the ANC asked. It blamed the  trouble on ""a few misguided individuals calling on us to fight against one  another.""

He made the  announcement at an ANC fundraising dinner in East London on  Saturday [19 March]. ""It is planned that the new president,  Nelson Mandela I think, will be installed, inaugurated on the  10th May, a big occasion in Pretoria."" It had to be in Pretoria  because Pretoria was the seat of power and government in the  country. ""For years we fought against the Pretoria regime. On  the 10th May we ought to be (talking of) the Pretoria  government.""    He said the ANC had been receiving numerous queries from  heads of state and of government in other countries asking  whether there would be victory celebrations after the April  election, or an inauguration of the new president. ""Everybody  wants to come,"" he said. The mayor of Pretoria and ""all sorts  of people"" were concerned about the prospect of having the  inauguration in the city. ""They are very worried not because  they don't want change,"" he said, to laughter from his audience,  ""but because they say Pretoria won't be able to handle the  volume of visitors that are going to come"".    Mr Mbeki said if South Africa failed to make the transition  to a peaceful and successful democracy, it would disappoint  millions of people across the globe. ""And that we can't do.  Too much has been invested by the rest of the world in ending  apartheid.""    There was a picture in many peoples' minds that Africans  were  incompetent, always holding out a begging bowl, had no respect  for democracy, were always at each others' throats and that  Africa was ""generally a disaster"". ""The rest of the continent  is expecting this new South Africa will change all that so the  rest of the world will see an African country that is a success  in terms of a political system, human rights, an absence of  conflict and prosperity...so the rest of the world can begin to  say our understanding of Africa was wrong.""    These expectations meant that in the end, South Africa had  to  make a success of the process of change. Other countries where  racism had raised its head, such as Sweden, France, Germany and  England, were hoping South Africa would provide the lessons that  would enable them to deal with their own problems. ""I'm saying  we've got to solve, we've got to succeed here in the interest of  making a better world for millions of people.""    He also said South Africa needed a strong ANC government to  ensure that the country's millions were all brought into the  settlement. If the ANC was too weak to do so, other people  would move into the vacuum. Some of them might preach revenge  against the whites who had oppressed them for three-and-a-half  centuries.    He said the country would also need a strong National Party  to bring white civil servants, the police and white business  into the settlement.     "

0,FT943-16086 ,"FT943-16086 _AN-EGFD2AEBFT 940706   FT  06 JUL 94 / Leading Article: A sad loss for South Africa   Yesterday's announcement of the impending departure of Mr Derek Keys as South Africa's finance minister presents Mr Nelson Mandela with the first serious challenge of his presidency. There is no reason to doubt Mr Keys when he cites 'personal reasons' for deciding to hand over his portfolio in October: he had always made clear that he did not see a long-term future in politics, and that once he had overseen the economic transition from apartheid to a government of national unity he would want to leave public life. He can justly claim that his budget of June 22 set the seal on such an orderly transition. It demonstrated that the new government intends to live within its means - by keeping the budget deficit to about 6 per cent of gross domestic product - as it struggles to redress the legacy of apartheid with a reconstruction and development plan. It underlined, above all, that stability would have to take precedence over fulfilling expectations of dramatic change. Nevertheless, Mr Keys's departure leaves a large hole. Former President F W de Klerk apart, no other individual has done as much to reassure the local business community and international investors during the past two years of tumultuous change. His greatest achievement has been to win and maintain the confidence of the African National Congress during the transition. Although he was chosen by Mr de Klerk, the force of his personality and his reputation as an apolitical pragmatist played a vital part in the ANC's abandonment of socialist economic policies. Compounding the loss was the way in which the resignation emerged - through a premature leak that unsettled financial markets. Mr Mandela's announcement last night that Mr Christo Liebenberg, a respected banker, will succeed Mr Keys goes some way to limiting the damage. But Mr Mandela must also reaffirm that his government intends to persevere with Mr Keys's policies of fiscal discipline and market reform. Ideally, such a reassertion of principles would be accompanied by equally unambiguous statements from the two other key members of the team administering economic policy, Mr Alec Erwin, deputy finance minister, and Mr Jay Naidoo, responsible for the reconstruction plan. They have already played a critical role, arguing as vigorously as Mr Keys for financial discipline, and their background in South Africa's trade union movement will give their words added weight. The jittery market reaction to the rumours that preceded yesterday's announcement should in itself provide Mr Mandela with a salutary lesson: that South Africa's new leadership still has a lot to prove in economic policy. If the episode of Mr Keys's resignation reinforces awareness that the policies he bequeathes are vital to domestic management and international confidence, it may yet turn out to have served a useful purpose.

0,FT934-15877 ,"FT934-15877 _AN-DJJAIAAVFT 931009   FT  09 OCT 93 / Mandela wants S Africa to join Lome pact      By Our Foreign Staff   MR NELSON MANDELA, the African National Congress leader, yesterday asked the European Community to allow a democratic South Africa to join the Lome Convention governing trade, aid and co-operation between the EC and 69 developing countries. At talks in Brussels with Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president, and Mr Manuel Marin, EC development commissioner, Mr Mandela is understood to have expressed a preference for accession to the Lome accord, rather than other options for EC-South African relations. The ANC president won EC pledges to help build a new civil service, army and police force, and Community support to prepare voters for multiracial elections next April. Mr Mandela said that while South African membership of Lome was under discussion, the republic's mixture of pockets of wealth surrounded by backwardness meant it should be regarded as an economy in transition, rather like the central European economies. The EC has progressive market access and substantial aid agreements with east and central Europe. But current thinking in Brussels favours a relationship with South Africa as part of a more integrated bloc of nations in southern Africa. This is based on the premise that Pretoria would join the Southern Africa Development Community, which South Africa already dominates economically by the strength of its trade and industrial links. EC officials are uncomfortable with the idea that South Africa, with comparative advantages in areas such as agriculture, a developed financial system, industrial capacity, and advanced transport and communications infrastructure, should be slotted into a format such as Lome designed to aid much less developed former colonies. Meanwhile in New York, the UN General Assembly yesterday agreed to end most economic sanctions against South Africa, two weeks after Mr Mandela, in an address to the world body, proposed lifting the restrictions However, the oil embargo will remain in place until the Transitional Executive Council agreed last month becomes operational, probably around the end of the year. In South Africa the government was yesterday criticised by the ANC and the Pan Africanist Congress for an early morning raid on a home in Umtata, Transkei in which five people died. The PAC denied that the house was used by its military wing. Meanwhile, conservatives have formed the Freedom Alliance, grouping former members of the Concerned South Africans Group (Cosag) - Bophutatswana, Ciskei, Inkatha, the Conservative Party and Afrikaner Volksfront. At the same time, Bophutatswana and Ciskei withdrew from the negotiating council - the forum for multi-party talks - and ended all meetings with the government and ANC. The Alliance's short-term aim is to present a single, united negotiating team which will seek concessions on federalism from the ANC. In the longer term, it seeks to displace the National Party as the country's second largest political group behind the ANC.   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.

""In this regard, ANC President Nelson Mandela has issued a  communique to all our regions and officials, to ensure that any  ANC member found to have flouted the electoral code of conduct  will be disciplined in terms of the ANC constitution.""    Thousands of posters and leaflets containing the electoral  code of conduct have been distributed to all ANC regions and  branches.    ""The ANC regrets all incidents of intimidation and  disruption  irrespective of who the perpetrators are,"" the statement said.     "

IT IS THEIR VISIONS OF A NEW NATION THAT DIFFER.      By Charlene Smith, Charlene Smith is a South African journalist.      JOHANNESBURG      Nelson Mandela has been freed, released from a small prison into the greater  jail of apartheid that imprisons all South Africans, black and white.    While about 200,000 Sowetans were cheering Mandela at a Tuesday rally outside  Johannesburg, Constitutional Development Minister Gerrit Viljoen was telling a  Cape Town press conference that the government agreed with the African National  Congress: The remains of apartheid should be removed. He also said the  government agreed there must be universal suffrage in a united, democratic  South Africa.    The ANC has called for a united, non-racial and democratic nation. Viljoen said  there would never again be a whites-only election and that in a new  constitution the National Party was unlikely to have control of government.  Superficially there seems increasingly little difference between what the  government is saying and what the ANC is demanding.    Ultimately both sides seek power and both want peace. It is their visions of a  new South Africa that differ.    In the immediate future the government wants international sanctions lifted;  the ANC is opposed to the lifting of sanctions, seeing them as a vital,  nonviolent weapon that has brought the government to its current willingness to  negotiate with blacks after 78 years of ignoring, suppressing and killing ANC  members who appealled for dialogue.    The ANC and other anti-apartheid forces fear that if the pressure of sanctions  eases, so too will the white government's desire to end apartheid.    In the West there appears to be sentiment -- conveyed by British Prime Minister  Margaret Thatcher -- that the South African government of President Frederick  W. de Klerk should be ""rewarded"" for releasing Mandela from his nearly 28-year  incarceration and for relaxing a few repressive measures.    But De Klerk has not touched the fundamental pillars of apartheid, which  remain. Nelson Mandela, as an example, is not a South African citizen in terms  of apartheid law.    Fewer than 15% of the blacks have been recognized as citizens of South Africa.  The rest of them have been forced to adopt the ""citizenship"" of the much-hated  Bantustans, or homelands, which formed a cornerstone to apartheid policy by  denying the right of blacks to be citizens of -- or to live in -- white South  Africa.    Whites swallowed up 85% of the land, leaving the remaining 15% for black  ""foreigners"" who were born and worked on white soil.    Technically Mandela is a citizen, even though he refuses to accept citizenship,  of the Transkei Bantustan. White South Africa created and gave ""independence""  to it in 1978 -- an independence that none of the world recognizes, not even  the Transkeians, who are currently trying to negotiate their reincorporation  into South Africa.    Last week the government said it will consider making blacks full citizens of  South Africa once more. But what of all the other apartheid laws? In this  context, Thatcher's idea of a reward seems less than appealing. Should white  South Africans be rewarded for lifting minor elements of a policy that was  morally repugnant when adopted?    While Thatcher talks of easing economic sanctions, the De Klerk government has  not proposed creation of a unitary education system to replace one now divided  on the basis of race and apartheid into 18 separate deparments.    Despite heavy pressure from the black community and increasing pressure from  anti-apartheid elements within the white community, the Pretoria government has  said that school desegregation is not negotiable.    Last year more than 200 white schools closed because there were not enough  white pupils. In black schools the teacher-pupil ratio has reached a staggering  1-90. Five times more is spent on the education of each white child; white  children enjoy a teacher-pupil ratio of 1-16. There is a black teacher shortage  of 300,000. Among those who currently teach, more than three-quarters are  underqualified and have received no formal teacher training.    In the white community there is so little interest in teaching as a profession  that four teacher-training colleges were closed down last year. There are  almost 2,000 vacancies in white teacher-training colleges, which refuse to  admit black students.    While removal of sanctions is the reward sought by De Klerk's government, the  ANC's immediate goal is the liberation of political activity -- two of Franklin  D. Roosevelt's four freedoms: freedom of speech and freedom of association.    The government, however, says if this is permitted violence will escalate as  rival factions from left and right, white and black, battle for power.  Officials say there is still a need to circumscribe political activity.    The ANC and United Democratic Front argue otherwise, claiming these restraints  on political mobilization make political violence more likely, arguing that  people who have a communal responsibility within the framework of a political  organization are less likely to resort to anti-social behavior.    Removal of political restraints would be a challenge to members of the  democratic anti-apartheid movement; they would have to start behaving like  political parties and not guerrilla or protest movements. As it is now, the  government still holds a vast array of security legislation on its books. For  example, although the ANC is unbanned, the law that banned it remains intact.  Although hundreds of people who could not be quoted or move freely have had  their restrictions lifted, the laws that curbed their lives remain in effect.    For negotiations to take place, a whole new climate of mutual trust must be  created.    The white press has criticized the ANC's commitment to continue the armed  struggle, although it is not involving its followers in acts of violence.  Nonetheless, the government also continues to expand and mobilize its armed  forces. This January almost 30,000 school graduates began military training,  even though both the government and ANC concede that warfare is not an option.    The government cannot afford another war on the heels of the Namibian conflict,  so demoralizing in its human and financial costs. The ANC, meanwhile, has all  but stopped violent acts and has acknowledged that it does not have the  capacity to intensify the armed struggle.    Both sides are setting the stage for a cessation of hostilities followed by a  mutually negotiated cease-fire. The first steps should begin after Mandela  visits ANC headquarters in Lusaka, Zambia, this week. The ANC said Friday it  would meet soon with De Klerk to help create a climate for negotiations.    White South Africa at last is recognizing it cannot hold power, or control,  forever.

The SACP [South African  Communist Party] has succeeded in its aim to get a stranglehold  on the ANC's list. Of the first 50 candidates 27 are member of  the SACP (54!) with another possible seven. It is clear that the  SACP has concentrated its efforts to be in the top of the list,  as fewer SACP members are listed further town. In the second  group of 50 there are 15 SACP (30!) members with a possibility  of six more. In the third 50, eight SACP (16!) members, with 2  more possibilities. [numbers in parentheses as received]    Other main features of the list are:    The absence of all the celebrities whom the ANC had misused  to attract attention to their list. It is clear that many of  these celebrities do not regard the ANC as an organisation which  they want to be associated with.    The fact that some of the ANC's allies have been given a  cold  shoulder as illustrated by the fact that Labour Party members  are relegated to positions low down on the list.    The fact that the ANC is persevering with the inclusion of  Mrs Winnie Mandela, who has been given a senior position. It  was unthinkable that in a democratic society that somebody who  has been convicted of a serious common crime, especially one of  kidnapping a child, is placed in a position where she may attain  political power.    It is clear that the moderates in the ANC have been  outmanouvred by the SACP and other militant elements will be  placed in a position to take control of the ANC and defeat the  ANC's moderate elements.    All South Africans who believe in true democracy, federal  principles and a free market economy, must now ignore the minor  differences that exist between them and unite to prevent the  names on this election list ever to become the strongest party  in Parliament.

Millions of voters flooded into the 9,000 polling stations  today in the country's first all-race elections which marks the  end of 350 years of white domination and the beginning of a new  era.    Most of the 22.7 million South African voters are voting  today and tomorrow to elect a 400-seat national assembly and  provincial legislatures.    About 16 million voters, or 72 percent of the total, are  blacks who are casting their bollats for the first time in their  life to exercise their political rights.    At 07:15, 15 minutes after the opening of the polling  stations, a car bomb exploded at Jan Smuts Airport in  Johannesburg, injuring 18 people. Police were questioning a  suspect who matched the description of a white man seen running  away from a car shortly before the blast.    But in other parts of South Africa, no death related to  political violence or terrorist acts has been reported.    About 10,000 policemen and 67 companies of the defense force  have been depolyed at and around the polling stations. The  heavy presence of security forces have deterred rightwingers  from disrupting the elections.    Political leaders in South Africa joined South African  voters  in the polls today.    African National Congress (ANC) leader Nelson Mandela cast  his vote at a polling station at Ohlange High School, north of  Durban, at 07:05. He is the first to cast votes today at the  polling station.    After casting his vote, Mandela said, ""this is for all South  Africans, an unforgettable occasion. It is the realization of  hopes and dreams that we have carried over decades.    ""The dream of a South Africa which represents all South  Africans.    ""It is the beginning of a new era. We have moved from an era  of pessimism, division, limited opportunities, turmoil, and  conflict,"" he said.    Mandela said: ""We are starting a new era of hope,  reconciliation and nation building.""    President F.W. de Klerk cast his vote at the Arcadia Primary  School in Pretoria.    After voting, De Klerk told reporters that the country is on  the eve of a golden era.    De Klerk said that he is enthusiastic about the many people  flooding to the polls.    ""it's a great day for South Africa. We have worked for this  for more than five years,"" he said.    He described the event as ""a wonderful day to vote for the  new South Africa.""    Due to logistical problems, voting at some polling stations  were delayed. Supplies of ballot papers ran out at a number of  polling stations in Eastern Cape before lunch. Security force's  helicopters were placed on standby to ferry voting materials to  the stations in the Eastern Cape once they had arrived from the  headquarters of the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC).    Voters in East Rand townships, eastern Johannesburg, were  among the most frustrated as 10 of Thokoza's polling stations  failed to open at all, while similar problems were experienced  in other stations in the region.    Facing the problems, President De Klerk declared tomorrow a  public holiday in favor of the voting.    The IEC also decided to extend the voting period today and  tomorrow to enable all voters to cast their ballots.    According to the IEC decision, polling stations will stay  open after the 19:00 (17:00 GMT) closing time today and tomorrow.    The IEC also decided to order the urgent printing of four  million extra ballot papers for Eastern Cape, where several  polling stations were shut down because of lack of ballot papers.    Meanwhile, the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) threatened to  pull  out of the elections, saying that IFP stickers have not been  attached to the ballot papers fefore they were issued.    The IFP's name failed to appear on the ballot papers because  its late entry into the election process, and an IFP sticker has  to be attached to each of the ballot papers.    President De Klerk said the IFP should not make such threat  at this stage and the problems are being solved.    Twenty-seven political parties are contesting the elections  with eight of them only contesting at the regional level.    The elections are expected to produce a government of  national unity led by the African National Congress and its  President Nelson Mandela is likely to become the country's next  president.    Yesterday was the special voting day for the disabled, the  pregnant, the infirm and members of the defense force, police  force and national peacekeeping force, and certain classes of  prisoners. South African citizens living abroad also cast their  votes yesterday.    The special voters who did not vote also voted today.     "

Mr AS Thiyagarajan's departure for New York means the four foreign banks most active in the securities market have now lost their top officials since the scandal erupted in April. All four - Citibank, US-owned Bank of America, Australia's ANZ Grindlays and Standard Chartered Bank of the UK - were criticised by the Reserve Bank of India, the central bank, and by a parliamentary committee investigating the scandal. A Citibank official confirmed Mr Thiyagarajan's transfer to the bank's headquaters but declined to comment on reports he was being shifted after criticism from the Reserve Bank of India about Citibank's operations in India. Earlier this week it emerged that the central bank refused to allow Mr Vikram Talwar, Bank of America's chief executive for India, to extend his posting after his three-year term expired on Monday. Mr Bob Edgar, ANZ Grindlays' chief executive for India, is leaving this week to a senior posting in Australia after two years in India. Earlier Mr PS Nat, Standard Chartered's chief executive for India, resigned to take responsibility for his bank's heavy losses.

Barely a week has gone by since the new government took office without what is presented as yet another presidential foreign policy initiative, exciting unrealistic expectations. Mr Mandela is, it seems, single-handedly reforming the Organisation of African Unity, in which newly-admitted South Africa is 'destined to play a leading role in peacekeeping and conflict resolution', according to local reports. He is much in demand. Over the past few weeks Mr Mandela has been described as 'brokering' peace efforts in Rwanda and Angola, and contemplating imposing democracy on troubled Lesotho. Thanks to President Francois Mitterrand's invitation, he will attend the next gathering of Francophone states, while the French leader's championing of South Africa placed the country 'firmly on the agenda' at last week's Group of Seven leading industrial nations' meeting in Naples. Meanwhile South Africa has rejoined the Commonwealth and looks forward to playing an active role in the Non-Aligned Movement. New ties have also been forged with Japan. Tokyo's aid package, said to be worth R4bn, will, says Mr Mandela, help to 'kick-start' the country's reconstruction and development plan. But closer examination of the package suggests it may be worth less than the initial estimates suggest. If all this is not enough, President Mandela appeared on video at President Bill Clinton's White House conference on Africa last month to lend his weight to calls for a Marshall Plan for the continent, the name given to the US-led programme to rebuild Europe after the second world war. Included in Mr Mandela's speech was an appeal for radical measures to ease Africa's external debt burden. While these initiatives - real, imagined or exaggerated - take place, one arm of foreign policy seems to be operating with its past efficiency: the state-owned arms manufacturer, Armscor. With sanctions lifted, and its activities given the endorsement of Mr Joe Modise, defence minister, officials are now lifting at least a corner of the veil of secrecy. The defence industry provides 70,000 jobs and foreign exchange, say government officials, who add defensively: 'If we didn't sell weapons, someone else would.' To be fair to Mr Mandela, he and his senior advisers have tried to play down expectations. On the one hand, Mr Mandela's integrity and moral authority makes him the acceptable voice of Africa on behalf of its many causes. At the same time, he makes clear that that he has no easy answers to offer. Advisers also point out that an effective diplomatic role is not made easier by the fact that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in the throes of reorganisation. South African missions abroad have doubled since the transition to respectability began, while new entrants to the diplomatic service have to be trained, and suitable ambassadors found to replace many of the pre-election incumbents. Meanwhile the overstretched service is still getting to grips with issues in which it has had little or no experience. These range from getting to know the OAU to the implications of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade deal, or reconciling relations with countries with whom ties were initially forged by the African National Congress, or the former government. Thus, the new South Africa has to weigh its relationship with Taiwan, one of its biggest trading partners, against recently-established official links with the People's Republic of China. The latter's trading potential is bigger, and its position as permanent member of the UN Security Council will have to be taken into account by Pretoria should South Africa have aspirations for a council seat as Africa's representative. Nominally in charge of this demanding portfolio is Mr Alfred Nzo, the foreign minister. His surprising appointment is put down to years of loyal service to the ANC. It may also be explained by the fact that policy will be shaped by Mr Mandela himself, and his senior deputy president, Mr Thabo Mbeki. As the initial euphoria and excitement dies down, South Africa's foreign policy is likely to become more cautious. Mr Aziz Pahad, the deputy foreign minister, acknowledges the dangers of taking on too much. But expectations are nevertheless high. In an interview with the Financial Times he echoes the explanation he gave to the Johannesburg Sunday Times: 'We have captured the moral high ground in nonracialism, democracy and conflict resolution to become the world leader in this area.' First of all, however, South Africa has to consolidate its success and build a stable, flourishing, democracy: 'If we don't sink, they (Africa's donors and creditors) see the hope that the region won't sink, and if the region doesn't sink, they see some hope of a breakthrough in the development of other parts of Africa.' Mr Pahad hopes that foreign investors do not ignore South Africa's neighbours: 'If you don't have mutually advantageous regional development, illegal immigrants will come to South Africa and, given that our borders are so big, we will not be able to prevent it.'

'Let me tell you there will be no postponement of elections  ..either in the province of Natal or in any of the provinces,' Mr Mandela told a youth conference in Durban. 'We will not postpone our freedom ..We will not postpone our plans to build a better life for all South Africans.' Some 700 additional troops were last night on their way to bolster the 2,000 soldiers already enforcing the state of emergency in Natal, where over 100 people have died in six days. A government spokesman said last night the Natal crisis required a political solution, which will be the focus of tomorrow's peace summit between Mr Mandela, President F W de Klerk, Inkatha leader Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi and Zulu King Goodwill Zwelethini, who are to meet at an undisclosed venue. The ANC hopes at that meeting to assuage the fears of the Zulu King about the future of his monarchy by promising to protect his salary and status under a new constitution. ANC officials believe they can offer the king a deal which will persuade him to break with his ally, Chief Buthelezi, and accept the constitution, seriously undermining Inkatha's election boycott.

0,FT934-11471 ,"FT934-11471 _AN-DKACHAADFT 931101   FT  01 NOV 93 / De Klerk concedes ground to ANC over constitution      By PATTI WALDMEIR      JOHANNESBURG   SOUTH AFRICA's ruling Nation-al party appears to have abandoned its demand for a constitutionally enshrined veto in a government of national unity to be headed by Mr Nelson Mandela if his African National Congress wins the country's first all-race general election next April. Joint proposals, which will be incorporated in a draft of the constitution due to be released today, show that the government has given substantial ground in its negotiations with the ANC on a new constitution. The National party would have little constitutionally entrenched power to block majority decisions. In an earlier draft, the party was guaranteed what amounted to a veto in the areas of budget, finance and security. The proposals call for multi-party power sharing in a five-year national unity government. However, the long-ruling National party, which speaks for minority interests and is likely to come second in next year's elections, now seems to have accepted a form of voluntary rather than enforced power sharing, with President F. W. de Klerk appearing to rely on assurances from Mr Mandela that fundamental decisions will not be taken without his approval. If the ANC wins the general election set for next April, Mr Mandela would become president of South Africa. Unless National party electoral support is drastically eroded, Mr de Klerk is likely to become second deputy president, alongside a first deputy president also from the ANC. If Mr de Klerk disagrees with the ANC, he can try to muster support from allies to outvote it in the cabinet. He is likely to need 40 per cent support to block the ANC, which still might not guarantee him automatic veto power. Dissent surfaced within Mr de Klerk's National party about the outcome of the talks. One influential party member said the proposals would leave the party 'at the mercy of the ANC'. The proposals also offer only limited powers to provincial assemblies. They are likely to reinforce fears of many whites and harden the opposition of Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi and his Inkatha Freedom party which demands a quasi-independent status for Natal province, the IFP stronghold. The IFP and its white partners in the right-wing Freedom Alliance have been given 10 days to respond to the proposals. Freedom Alliance officials condemned the proposals, released yesterday, saying they did not devolve sufficient powers to regional governments. ANC and government negotiators expect to wrap up three years of off-on constitutional negotiations this week, completing proposals on how a final constitution should be written, on the composition of a constitutional court, and on local government. They will then present the document as a final offer to the Freedom Alliance, which includes the IFP and the white Conservative party. Negotiators, say they will tell the alliance to accept the offer within 10 days, or the government and ANC will proceed to elections alone.

Mr Aldo Brancher, responsible for special projects at the Fininvest communications subsidiary but understood to be a lobbyist, is being sought by Milan magistrates for questioning about irregularities at the Ministry of Health. The warrant, for illegal funding of political parties, follows allegations by Mr Giovanni Marone, secretary to a former health minister, that Fininvest paid L300m (Dollars 200,000) in kickbacks on a television advertising contract during the government's anti-Aids campaign. The money allegedly went to Mr Francesco De Lorenzo, a former health minister, who this year resigned after his father, a prominent Naples doctor and ex-politician, was investigated on corruption allegations. Magistrates subsequently informed Mr De Lorenzo, a senior member of the small Liberal party, he was under investigation in connection with a Naples jobs-for-votes scandal. The involvement of Mr Brancher in the corruption scandal is a big setback for Mr Berlusconi, who has faced growing difficulties following a government decision to re-examine Italy's controversial revision of broadcasting frequencies. Fininvest, which controls three TV channels, has about 45 per cent of the audience. Mr Berlusconi has been complaining of a media campaign against him. In recent weeks, he has been targeted by parts of the media controlled by Mr Carlo De Benedetti, an arch-rival. The attacks followed reports that Mr Davide Giacalone, an adviser to a former posts minister, subsequently obtained a L420bn consultancy with Fininvest. Mr Giacalone assisted Mr Oscar Mammi, the posts minister responsible for the broadcasting frequency allocations now due to be re-examined.   Companies:-  Finanziaria d'Investimento.

0,FT943-16224 ,"FT943-16224 _AN-EGFD2AAEFT 940706   FT  06 JUL 94 / S African markets hit as finance minister quits      By MARK SUZMAN and MICHAEL HOLMAN      JOHANNESBURG   Mr Derek Keys resigned suddenly yesterday as South Africa's finance minister in a move which threw markets into turmoil and raised concern about the country's future economic policies. Mr Keys denied that any policy clash lay behind his announcement, and cited unspecified 'personal reasons' for his decision. President Nelson Mandela, who told a hastily summoned press conference last night that Mr Keys had informed him of his request last Thursday, moved quickly to allay market concern by naming Mr Christo Liebenberg, a prominent banker, to replace Mr Keys. Mr Liebenberg, 60, retired in February as chief executive of the Nedcor banking group. Mr Keys' efforts to reassure markets were undermined only hours later by a sharply critical statement from the powerful Congress of South African Trade Unions, which charged that by his actions yesterday the minister had put at risk the government's reconstruction and development programme, and had betrayed Mr Mandela's trust. In his official announcement released yesterday, Mr Keys praised Mr Mandela and Mr FW de Klerk, the deputy president, as 'remarkable leaders' and said that his aim as finance minister had been to contribute to an orderly transfer of power and 'protect the country's economic base'. His resignation created South Africa's first crisis since the inauguration of Mr Mandela in May. It was greeted by widespread shock and dismay in the local business community. Mr Keys was respected both domestically and abroad for his prudent stewardship of the South African economy and had become a symbol of integrity and competence in the administration during a two-year term of office which began under the white-led government of Mr de Klerk. Adding to the distress was the inept way in which the news yesterday was handled. If Mr Keys' statement can be taken at face value, news of the move was inadvertently leaked earlier in the day and the result was that for several hours confusion reigned. Rumours about Mr Keys' decision began to reach the Johannesburg stock market by mid-afternoon, and bond yields climbed sharply while the financial rand, the main barometer of foreign sentiment, weakened by 2.6 per cent against the dollar. However the appointment of Mr Liebenberg, who has no formal political affiliations, will partially help to stabilise the situation. By again going outside the political arena to appoint a minister with credibility in the private sector, Mr Mandela will hope to allay fears that Mr Keys' departure will also mean a shift from the government's commitment to fiscal restraint. The appointment also means that the National party, which in terms of the constitution is entitled to six cabinet posts, will be given another cabinet appointment. 'In the short term at least it's very bad news for the markets,' said Mr Michiel Bester, economist at the consulting firm Econometrix. 'It creates a lot of unwelcome uncertainties.'

MUIR, TIMES STAFF WRITER      As much as the City Council members wanted Treasurer Leonard Rittenberg to go,  they had some pragmatic reasons for keeping him around on a lucrative $50,000  consulting contract.    Council members said Wednesday that much of the treasurer's office policies,  procedures and history are carried only in Rittenberg's head and the city needs  to get it all down on paper before he leaves for good.    ""He's the only one who knows where the bodies are buried,"" said Councilman Zev  Yaroslavsky, chairman of the Budget and Finance Committee that oversees the  treasurer's office. ""One of his great weaknesses -- and what finally got  Leonard into trouble -- is that rules were never reduced to writing.""    The council voted Wednesday to accept a settlement allowing Rittenberg to  resign rather than to be fired for his role in a scandal involving the mayor  and a downtown bank.    But even as council members agreed that Rittenberg had to leave after 2 1/2  years at the helm, some council members said they still respect his talents as  a prudent investor of a $2-billion portfolio.    ""As troubled as his office has been, he has an expertise that cannot be  ignored,"" said Yaroslavsky. Councilman Richard Alatorre, vice chairman of the  council's Revenue Committee, added, ""He's been there 22 years, he's got  something to offer.""    Under the settlement approved by the council on Wednesday, Rittenberg will  retire June 1 and be paid $50,000 as a consultant for the remaining six months  of the year.    But while Rittenberg was respected as a technician, he was condemned as a poor  manager who allowed the department to fall into disarray -- particularly during  the scandal over an investment he made in a bank that had employed the mayor.  Rittenberg invested $2 million in Far East National Bank in March, 1989, after  receiving a phone call from Mayor Tom Bradley. Rittenberg has steadfastedly  denied that the mayor tried to influence him.    ""From a pragmatic point of view, we wanted him out as soon as possible,"" said  one council member who spoke on condition of anonymity. ""He was a negative  influence"" in the department as local and federal investigations demanded more  and more of his time and the loyalty of his staff was strained.    Firing Rittenberg could have resulted in Civil Service Commission appeals  lasting up to a year and costing the city many thousands of dollars in legal  fees, city officials said. During that time, Yaroslavsky said, the city would  have been required to pay Rittenberg his regular salary of $83,415 a year.    In addition, the firing could have resulted in litigation costing the city  still more, according to council members.    On the other hand, council members said, settlement guaranteed a swift and  amicable exit for Rittenberg.    Rittenberg joined the treasurer's office in 1968 as an accountant and steadily  rose in the department to become chief deputy in 1981 and then was named acting  treasurer in 1986 when former Treasurer Robert Odell became ill. Odell died in  1987 without returning to the job and Rittenberg was appointed treasurer by  Bradley in 1987.    ""We need to clean house and restore confidence in that office,"" said Alatorre.  ""We do know that absenteeism is high and morale is low.""    Yaroslavsky said, ""We have an office besieged and beleaguered by scandal and  preoccupied with defending itself.""    Since the scandal first erupted in the weeks before Bradley's close victory for  a record fifth term as mayor in April, 1989, Rittenberg and his senior deputies  told conflicting stories about how the $2 million came to be invested in Far  East National Bank. They openly disagreed on who was responsible for the  attempted cover-up of the transaction -- including the infamous obliteration of  a reference ""per the mayor"" on one document.    In the wake of the investigations, cash management officer Bill Hoss retired  without returning to the office, and a senior investment officer, George  Sehlmeyer, was out on leave for five months, before returning to the office  last week.    Council members said the ouster of Rittenberg is only one of many changes  necessary to restore credibility to the treasurer's office.    ""The office needs more than just a new treasurer, it needs a new attitude, it  needs a housecleaning,"" said Yaroslavsky.    Some council members privately questioned whether the return on the city's  investments -- which can run into the tens of millions of dollars annually --  has suffered during the last year as a result of the tumult in Rittenberg's  office. Yaroslavsky said he will ask the council on Tuesday to approve a 90-day  extension of a program in which the chief administrative officer provides daily  oversight of the treasurer's office to ensure that council-approved policies  and procedures are followed.    In the end, there was one other overriding factor in the council's decision:  Most members of the council like Rittenberg.    He is seen by council members and many city bureaucrats as a ""nice guy"" --  serious but approachable, easy to work with and genuine.

The death of Mr Majocchi, who was taken to hospital after shooting himself in the head at home on Sunday, follows that last month of Mr Renato Amorese, secretary of the Socialist party in Lodi, near Milan. Mr Majocchi's motives remain obscure, unlike those of Mr Amorese, who left a long letter. After being interviewed by Milanese magistrates on Friday, Mr Majocchi, managing director of a company active in public sector contracting in Lombardy, returned home apparently unperturbed. The latest incident follows a shift of focus from politicians to industrialists in the continuing investigation. Last Friday, police arrested Mr Giancarlo Cozza, the 55-year-old chief executive of Fiat Ferroviaria Savigliano, the railway equipment division of the Fiat group. His arrest, and that of the owner of a local Iveco bus dealership, brought to 71 the number of people now charged in connection with the widening investigations. Mr Cozza, detained on suspicion of having paid bribes for contracts to supply rolling stock to Milan's underground railway, is the second Fiat executive to have been arrested in the affair. Earlier this year, police arrested Mr Enzo Papi, chief executive of Fiat's Cogefar Impresit building subsidiary, Italy's biggest building group. Mr Papi, who refused to give evidence and eventually resigned from his job, was finally released.  The Financial Times   London Page 2  "

The scandal follows revelations in the Indonesian Parliament  that Bapindo, the state-owned development bank had lent U.S.$430  million to Eddy Tansil, a businessman who heads the Golden Key  group of companies.    Legislator A.A. Baramuli, who belongs to the ruling Golkar  [Functional Group] party, told MPs that the money had not been  repaid and was now one of 49 cases of bad or doubtful debts  amounting to billions of dollars owed to state banks.    The loan was apparently made to subsidiaries of Golden Key  for the construction of petrochemical plants in the West Java  city of Cilegon. Hutomo Mandala Putra (Tommy), a son of  President Suharto. was chairman of one of the subsidiaries and  his Humpuss Group a minor shareholder at the time the loan was  made.    Last week, General Sudomo, former coordinating minister of  politics and security and now chairman of the president's  Supreme Advisory Council, said he had recommended that Bapindo  lend money for the project but that neither he nor his family  had any personal financial interest in it. Gen. Sudomo had  earlier strongly criticised the MP who revealed the loan details  claiming that he had violated bank secrecy laws.    A series of current ministers, including Finance Minister  Mar'ie Muhammed, Governor of the Central Bank Sudrajat  Jiwandono, and Bapindo executives have appeared in parliament  denying knowledge of the loan or refusing to answer questions  about the matter.    Their reticence has led to parliamentary calls for revision  of the bank secrecy laws.    J.B. Sumarlin, finance minister at the time the loan was  granted in 1992 also denied that he had any personal interest in  the project or that he had recommended it be granted when he was  a commissioner of Bapindo.    Mr. Hutomo admitted he had pushed Bapindo to make the loan  for the project but said that Humpuss had now sold its  shareholding in the Golden Key subsidiary because it realised  that the plant would cost double its planned budget.    Mr. Tansil has claimed that he is servicing the loan, but  there appears little evidence that the money has been used to  import equipment for the plant, the reason for the loan  according to a letter of credit issued by Bapindo. Both Mr.  Tansil and another Golden Key director have been banned from  leaving Indonesia.    Foreign bankers say that the scandal points to the way  influential people can ignore laws and regulations set up by the  Central Bank and how state banks have been powerless to reject  requests for loans from such people.    The loan to Mr. Tansil violated Bapindo's legal lending  limit  at the time and Mr. Tansil had been taken to court earlier for  non-payment of loans to foreign banks.    ""He is well known to Bank Indonesia,"" a foreign banker said,  adding that normal credit risk evaluations were clearly not made.    The Golden Key case is not the first time that Mr. Hutomo  has  been involved in borrowing from state banks for failed projects.  In 1991, he borrowed U.S. $400 million from the central bank to  establish a monopoly over the clove trade, which subsequently  collapsed.    Last year, the government ended the practice of so-called  ""memo loans"" -- funds granted on the basis of a memo from an  important individual -- from state banks under a programme  backed by the World Bank to recapitalise the major state banks.

""The immediate  source of pressure, of course, is the election, with its  necessary deadlines."" ""However, the truly relentless pressures  lie deeper, beyond the reach of mere politicians, and it has  been these underlying pressures that came into play, especially  in Bophuthatswana, this week."" ""The people who have all but  brought down Mangope's regime are South Africa's hidden actors.  They are million of ordinary black folk who destroyed  apartheid, and in whose hands the destiny of South Africa  lies.....they, and not President de Klerk and his reformers,  ended apartheid."" In conclusion the paper writes that ""South  Africa needs only political stability and reasonably sensible  economic policies to burst out of the stagnation of the past  three decades, and the elections are the first, necessary, step  towards stability. At the same time, there is an vital role for  men like Chief Buthelezi and General Viljoen to play in  fashioning the final constitution, in curbing the lust for power  which is evident in the ANC [African National Congress], and in  ensuring representation for the widest range of views in  Parliament. Welcome them to the fray.""    SUNDAY NATION    IFP Registration for Election -- ""Inkatha Freedom Party  (IFP)  leader Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi's decision to `provisionally'  register for the elections, should be treated with caution,""  begins the Johannesburg SUNDAY NATION in English on 6 March in a  page-6 editorial. ""It should be remembered that before his  meeting with ANC leader, Nelson Mandela, he shot down the whole  idea of participating in the elections."" Buthelezi's  ""vacillation"" ""simply deepens the opinion of political observers  who have found Buthelezi to be a man who is simply interested in  shifting goalposts to avoid the elections at all costs.  Creating an uncertainty about the future has been one of the  effective instruments in creating tension in the black  townships. This has also planted fertile seeds of political  violence and wanton criminal acts of lawlessness."" ""While the  ANC's commitment to an all-inclusive settlement is commendable,  Buthelezi should not be allowed to delay the long-awaited  elections for his personal reasons."" ""ANC and the government  should not bend over backwards for Buthelezi anymore. Now is  the time to go forward with or without him.""    TEC Standstill Criticized -- In a second editorial on the  same page, the SUNDAY NATION reports that ""with less than two  months to go before the April 27 election, the Transitional  Executive Council [TEC] seems unable to perform its tasks  adequately."" ""As things stand now, the TEC has been unable to  reassure people in Bophuthatswana and kwaZulu-Natal about""  whether or not they will be able to vote. Additionally, items  brought before the TEC are ""never finalised immediately after  presentation. They are often referred to later sittings.  Occasionally the TEC has had to wait until certain situations  were out of control before taking a decision."" Concluding the  SUNDAY NATION writes that ""the TEC really needs to jack up if we  are to continue having confidence in it. We want to believe  that there is no better structure to turn to during this  transition. But the TEC should sharpen its teeth and take its  rightful place in the hearts of our people.""    RAPPORT    ANC Propaganda Machine Running Out of Steam -- A page-22  editorial in RAPPORT of 6 March in Afrikaans writes that in the  Western Cape the ANC ""is no longer so talkative, and in Natal  this week it was dealt two stiff blows."" President F. W. de  Klerk's visit to this province and the type of reception  accorded him should be something that not only Mr. Nelson  Mandela ""should sit up and take note of, but also the communist  archenemy, Mr. Harry Gwala. Even those opinion polls that  predict a runaway victory for the ANC have been more cautious  lately. The premature ANC choruses of demands and those big  promises also seem to have taken -- hopefully for good -- a back  seat."" Mr. de Klerk's campaigning had resounding successes  among the Indian and colored populations in Natal where he made  no attempt to glorify the National Party's past mistakes, but  instead asked for forgiveness. ""But,"" he asked, ""has the ANC  ever said sorry for its wrong deeds? Has it become a new  party?"" The second blow for the ANC was Mr. Mandela's meeting  with Mr. Mangosuthu Buthelezi. The ANC propaganda machine had  tried to make it appear as if it were the biggest gesture of  reconciliation and a victory for Mr. Mandela. ""With dubious  success."" It is no longer a question of what did Mr. Mandela  say to Mr. Buthelezi to change his mind, but rather ""what did  Mr. Buthelezi say to Mr. Mandela to make him sing a different  tune?"" Mr. Mandela's grim face after the meeting told a story.  ""The shrewd Mr. Buthelezi had unmasked Mr. Mandela and the  ANC's propaganda.""     "

The journeys of General Panic to Russia and Iraq in March  1993 can be seen in this light.

0,FT942-11797 ,"FT942-11797 _AN-EEDEHADIFT 940504   FT  04 MAY 94 / Leading Article: South Africa looks forward   South Africa's transition from minority rule to democracy is something to celebrate. Not even the painfully inefficient election count can spoil an event of such moment and one whose significance extends well beyond the region. A stable, democratic and economically successful South Africa might yet offer hope for a continent debilitated by debt, disaster and disease. It could even become a model for other countries where ethnic and racial tensions present seemingly insuperable barriers to economic progress. Fulfilment of these hopes will be as difficult as the transition itself, but South Africa has made an encouraging start. President FW de Klerk has left office with a grace that has enhanced his reputation and augurs well for his expected role as second vice president. General Constand Viljoen, the former armed services chief, steered the conservative right away from confrontation and into the election. He deserves credit for defusing what could have been a destabilising clash. Above all, the president-elect, Mr Nelson Mandela, leader of the victorious African National Congress, is preparing for office with the pragmatism and compassion that is his hallmark. With the grim legacy of apartheid all around him, he was right to strike a note of urgency in his victory speech on Monday night, promising that he and his team will roll up their sleeves and get South Africa back to work. Cabinet places He was also wise to offer places in his cabinet to parties which failed to reach the 5 per cent that would give them automatic representation in a government of national unity: the liberal Democratic party, the radical Pan Africanist Congress and Gen Viljoen's Freedom Front, which seeks reassurance that Afrikaner culture will survive. It would be wise to extend a similar invitation to Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, although his Inkatha Freedom party may have attracted sufficient votes to secure it a cabinet seat. Chief Buthelezi's difficulties with the ANC and its leader are well-known. Yet nothing can be lost by attempting to bring this prickly personality into the fold. In selecting his cabinet Mr Mandela must also look beyond his domestic constituency. A careful balance is needed to reassure international investors, who look for stability. They will wish to see continuity of the sound economic policies that have characterised the transition. The retention of Mr Derek Keys, the present finance minister, in one of the main economic portfolios would constitute a clear signal that this is understood. Mr Chris Stals, the governor of the Reserve Bank, should be asked to stay in his job. It may be difficult for Mr Mandela but room should be found for both men, not as token whites but as key players in South Africa's new economic team. Investment code Mr Mandela must also be on his guard against those who argue for an investment code. Rev Leon Sullivan, the US-based campaigner, achieved some success in urging foreign companies who decided to maintain their operations in the old South Africa to end discrimination on the shop floor, introduce training programmes and accept social responsibilities in the black community. He and others now advocate similar terms for would-be foreign investors. These objectives are well-meant, but to make them a condition displays a misunderstanding of the tough competition for investment. No lobby urges the same conditions for other developing nations. Some investors are showing strong interest in post-apartheid South Africa, whether as a market in its own right, or as a base for operations in the rest of Africa. Yet the new government is in no position to lay down terms that might drive investment capital to more attractive Asian homes. Indeed, Mr Mandela should bear Asian lessons closely in mind as he looks to the future. That implies a market-driven exchange rate, a competitive business environment, a close partnership between government and the private sector, trade liberalisation, encouragement of multinationals with their worldwide marketing facilities, technology and management skills and an efficient civil service. He will best serve the new South Africa if he applies these principles. He might also then galvanise the rest of Africa, for whom he is already an inspiration.

United States Vice-President Al Gore,  British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, Palestinian Liberation  Organisation Chairman Yasir 'Arafat, Tanzanian founding  President Julius Nyerere and more than 80 other leaders arrived  to heap praise on South Africa and its people.    Heading a 65-strong U.S. delegation, the most senior to  visit  South Africa, Mr Gore said the moment was historic not only for  South Africa but for all mankind. The inauguration of African  National Congress leader Nelson Mandela marked a transition in  the history of the world, he said. The U.S. civil rights  movement and the struggle for democracy in South Africa were  historically intertwined with both countries sharing the spirit  of the fight for full democracy. ""And so the people of the  United States rejoice with the people of South Africa. We look  forward towards starting a new and more vigorous relationship.  We see the inauguration tomorrow (Tuesday) of Mr Mandela as the  beginning of a partnership between our two countries."" Included  in the us delegation was first lady Hilary Clinton, Mr Gore's  wife Tipper, the Rev Jesse Jackson and U.S. Secretary of  Commerce Ron Brown.    On his arrival, Mr Hurd said there has been a huge upsurge  in  British business interest in South Africa. He said he was in  the country to show Britain's support for a new South Africa and  was going directly from the airport to visit British-aided  projects in the East Rand townships.    Croatian Prime Minister Mr Nikica Valentic said South Africa  had shown it was possible to satisfy diverse interests in a  positive way. ""We are a country that has emerged from war. The  message (from South Africa) is political solutions have to be  sought by peaceful means,"" he said.    Former British prime minister Lord James Callaghan said  South  Africa would be an example to the rest of Africa. Asked if he  had a message for this country, Lord Callaghan said: ""South  Africa is going to work out its own destiny.""    Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto said the struggle  against apartheid had few parallels in modern history. ""We are  confident that under Mr Mandela's sagacious leadership the scars  of the past will soon heal and the goal of peace and development  will be achieved.""    The diminutive Mr Arafat, wearing his traditional black and  white keffiyeh, said he brought greetings from the Palestinian  people ""and best wishes for my brother and friend President  Mandela...and Mr (F W) de Klerk"". He was greeted by ANC  representative Stanley Mabisela who held the PLO leader's hand  as the large delegation strode into the airport building.    Mr Nyerere, once a crusader against colonialism and a  long-time enemy of Pretoria, said he had always wanted to come  to a free South Africa. ""I never believed it would come. But  here it is.""    Bangladeshi Foreign Minister A S M Rahman, who was asked if  his country would be investing in South Africa, said Bangladesh  had no money to invest ""but we will share our knowledge"".    On his arrival, Danish Prime Minister Poul Rasmussen praised  the demise of apartheid as ""a victory for humanity"" and pledged  R375 million [rand] in aid for South Africa's transition. He  said he hoped the two countries would exchange ""experiences"",  expecially in the labour market, and he extended a formal  invitation to Mr Mandela to visit Denmark. The Danish national  soccer team, European champions in 1992, were scheduled to visit  South Africa in 1995, Mr Rasmussen announced. ""This is a most  happy moment in Danish international politics. (It) is the fall  of the Berlin Wall...in human terms...a victory for humanity.""    From Syria to the Bahamas, Italy, Slovakia, Georgia, Malta,  Iran, Malaysia, the Philippines and Romania they continued to  pour into Jan Smuts from dawn and into the night. Other  notables included the Irish President Mary Robinson, Greek King  Constantine and Mr Abdul Rahman Taib who is the Industry  Minister of Brunei, the richest country per capita in the world.  Also among them were European Union Chairman T Pangalos,  Portuguese president Dr Mario Soares, French first lady  Danniella Mitterand, Spanish heir apparent Prince Asturias and  Finland President Mr Martii Ahtisaari [name and title as  received] who is credited with brokering Namibian independence.  The presidents of Zambia, Angola, Mozambique and Namibia, as  well as Lesotho King Letsie III, were due to arrive later in the  night.    The prize for the biggest present went to the Philippines --  a four-foot square box in colourful wrapping paper and ribbon  reportedly containing shoes for Mr Mandela.    By 6PM there was still no news of the expected appearance of  Libyan Chief Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi or Cuban leader Fidel Castro.  A Cuban aircraft arrived early on Monday but apparently it was  carrying only cigars.    On his arrival, Zambian President Frederick Chiluba said:  ""Africa has been decolonised and is in the process of  democratisation -- that is the challenge.""     "

It has threatened directly  the government. The prime minister now clearly wants to revive  the mechanism of a reshuffled team, not by refusing to forget  the ""scandal"" but by trying to show that ministerial work must  continue.    [Dehaene] With regard to the Agusta scandal, it is a good  thing that matters have been clarified by drawing a distinction  between government policy and the handling of ""scandals."" And  that those whose names have been mentioned should be free to  defend themselves. I do not want to trivialize these events.  This issue must be cleared up, like the Andre Cools murder, and  any other scandal which breaks out in the future. I therefore  insist that the legal authorities be allowed to act, according  to their rules, on this issue and on any others that arise.    [LE SOIR] The Agusta scandal has shown the need for some  reforms. Will you propose them?    [Dehaene] Discussions were already under way on party  funding, the limitation of election spending, ensuring the  objectivity of nominations, or the establishment of an ombudsman  in public enterprises or Parliament. What has happened has  served as a catalyst.    The issues on which parliamentary groups and parties will  have to take the initiative -- namely immunity, the status of  deputies, and funding -- should be distinguished from those  which relate to the state apparatus and are the government's  responsibility: ministerial responsibility, the control of  public appropriations, recruitment and promotion in the  magistrature and civil service.    [LE SOIR] Are you not afraid that other scandals will  emerge,  as they have in Italy?    [Dehaene] First, let us not make too hasty a comparison with  Italy. Second, if other scandals emerge, they will have to be  clarified. Third, if they are the result of vengeance, that is  dangerous.    [LE SOIR] Do you share the view of those who talk of  different ethics in the north and the south? Those who think  that the PS [French-speaking Socialist Party] is a sicker party  than the others?    [Dehaene] Public opinions and voters are different. The  parties, politicians, and media often reflect that. That may  create different sensitivities. But I do not think there are  fundamentally opposite approaches. In other, previous cases,  questions were asked, in the north and the south, about the  resignation of certain people....    [LE SOIR] What do you think of the defense adopted by Guy  Coeme?    [Dehaene] I will not express an opinion or a judgment on the  aspect of this case under jurisdiction.    [LE SOIR] Guy Coeme has criticized the ""excessive media  coverage"" and ""over-politicization"" of the issue. Do you agree?    [Dehaene] The system of parliamentary immunity and Article  90  must be reviewed because, in view of the media coverage, what  was originally a protection has turned into a system under which  the politician is tried twice. It is up to Parliament to draw  the necessary conclusions.    [LE SOIR] Nonetheless you called for the creation of a  financial, social, and fiscal status for the deputy....    [Dehaene] It is one thing to say what is a desirable reform.  Giving a verdict on how to implement it is a different matter.  As a deputy, I will say what I think about it within my party.  But that is not the prime minister's role.    [LE SOIR] At one time, the PS said that you too had met  with Agusta envoys. Did that annoy you?    [Dehaene] I note that, susequently Mr. Spitaels issued a  communique explaining that he had not intended to implicate  other people. As for the decision on the Agusta issue, I  participated in it as a government member. I have shouldered my  responsibilities. At the time there were contacts between the  different candidates and my office. A distinction must be drawn  between the licit and illicit aspects of the issue.    I have been involved in other cases of public  appropriations:  At the time of the RTT [Telegraph and Telephone Administration]  contract, we were subjected to lobbying from all sides. The  RTT's interests seemed secondary to the effects on Flanders or  Wallonia. I therefore say that the issue of appropriations  should be dealt with according to the principle of the best  relationship between quality and price and not in accordance  with which enterprises need investments. Indirect compensation,  which is often dubious, must therefore be abandoned. On the  other hand, direct compensation can be useful if it does not  affect the price.    [LE SOIR] Last week, did you pass on the view of the CVP  [Christian People's Party] deputies who thought that Guy Coeme  should resign? Did you take that action?    [Dehaene] I am abiding strictly by the reply I gave in  Parliament, each word of which was carefully considered.    [LE SOIR] Coeme says that his resignation was a personal  decision. But it came several hours after a conversation which  you had with the PS president. Was that meeting not the  decisive factor?    [Dehaene] No.    [LE SOIR] Has the government now been weakened?    [Dehaene] It is a good thing for the government program that  the PS has appointed new ministers. But I certainly do not rule  out the fact that the process of the Agusta scandal or the  emergence of other issues could have an influence on the  government or the pursuit of its policy at a given time. At  present, the two spheres are clearly separate. During my  meeting with the presidents of the majority parties, all clearly  expressed their desire to see this issue resolved and their  desire to pursue government action until the end of the  parliamentary term.    [LE SOIR] Do you agree with Gerard Deprez? He does not rule  out the possibility of the government's unity being undermined?    [Dehaene] His remarks speak for themselves! It is one thing  to say: For the time being matters have been clarified and the  government is in a good position to pursue its policy; saying  that the development of the Agusta scandal or the emergence of  other scandals will have no influence on the coalition is a  different matter. You would have to be naive to think that!    [LE SOIR] Was it necessary to give guarantees to the PS for  it to remain in power?    [Dehaene] No. Not other than to express our determination to  carry on to the end of the parliamentary term, which is natural.  Philippe Busquin clearly took account of the other parties'  desire to complete the parliamentary term. Moreover, this is in  the interests of the PS and the other parties, because the  government had a threefold objective: The reform of the state  virtually has been completed, the overall plan has been drawn up  and must be implemented in all its dimensions, and, finally, the  contract with the citizen must be highlighted and given greater  prominence and this implies reforms which take longer. After  two years of preparatory work in several spheres, we can adopt  bills and start to implement them on the ground.    [LE SOIR] The Flemish liberals continue to level very harsh  criticisms at you. What is your answer to them?    [Dehaene] Those who think they will extricate themselves by  exploiting the antipolitical climate are merely strengthening  that phenomenon.     "

By SCOTT KRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER      PRETORIA, South Africa      When red-robed Judge Quartus de Wet, sitting in Courtroom C of the Palace of  Justice here, considered the case against Nelson R. Mandela in 1964, it was not  a question of guilt or innocence that he pondered.    It was whether to send Mandela and seven co-defendants to Death Row or give  them life sentences. A ninth man, Lionel Bernstein, was acquitted but arrested  after the trial and banned.    ""The atmosphere was very grim,"" remembers George Bizos, a Johannesburg lawyer  who was on the defense team. ""There was a great hue and cry in the country, and  a great fear among us all, that they would be sentenced to death.""    In his statement to the judge, introduced without cross-examination, Mandela  had admitted his role in launching Umkhonto we Sizwe, or Spear of the Nation,  the military wing of the then-banned African National Congress, and he said he  was prepared to die for what he believed.    ""It wasn't just rhetoric,"" said Bizos, who is still one of Mandela's lawyers  and a longtime friend. ""Nelson has a sense of history, and he considered  himself as one of a line of people who had been dealt with harshly by the law.""    The defendants were charged with sabotage, a capital crime equal to treason  under South African law. The state accused them of recruiting people to make  explosives and training them to plant them. In all, the charge sheet listed  nearly 200 attacks of sabotage and damage to property aimed at symbols of  apartheid, such as rail lines and pass offices, during 1961-63.    The defendants and their four attorneys discussed whether they should even  testify in their own defense, with some arguing that doing so would be  tantamount to accepting the legality of the proceedings.    But, because the government planned to cross swords with the defendants on  political issues, it was decided that the defendants would place their  positions on record. The resulting speech from the prisoner's dock by Mandela,  delivered to a packed courtroom in 1964, came to be the guiding document for  the armed struggle against Pretoria.    Their defense was that they had no option, given the violence launched by the  state against peaceful protest, and they argued that it was nothing more than  what the white Afrikaner people had done years earlier to win  self-determination under British colonial rule. As Umkhonto we Sizwe's  manifesto, seized by police, had said: ""There comes a time in the life of a  nation when they can no longer turn the other cheek.""    ""As a legal defense, it wasn't one,"" Bizos says. ""There was no legal defense.  They said, 'Yes, we formed this organization.' There was no attempt to avoid  responsibility.""    In his closing arguments, Percy Yutar, the deputy attorney general, said he was  amazed by the ""conceit and deceit"" of the defendants, who he contended  represented less than 1% of the black population.    Yutar described the crime as ""a classic case of the intended overthrow of the  government by force and violence. It is tragic to think that the accused, who  between them did not have the courage to commit a single act of sabotage  themselves, should have incited their followers to acts of guerrilla warfare,  open rebellion and ultimately civil war.""    Judge De Wet, who had heard the lawyer Mandela defend clients in his courtroom  many times, sentenced the eight convicted men to life in prison, saying ""that  is the only leniency I can show.""    ""The primary concern was to save their lives,"" Bizos said. ""And the verdict was  a tremendous relief.    ""The feeling at the time, both of the prisoners and ourselves, was that the  life sentence would not be served,"" he added. ""Certainly we didn't think in  terms of 26 or 27 years. Somehow it always seemed that apartheid would come to  an end within the near future.""    Mandela, released Sunday, was the last to regain his freedom.    Dennis Goldberg was released in 1985 after accepting President Pieter W.  Botha's offer of an amnesty if he renounced violence. As a white, he had not  been sent with the others to Robben Island prison, northwest of Cape Town, but  was jailed on the mainland.    Govan Mbeki, born in 1910 and the oldest defendant, was freed in November,  1987, but was subjected to a banning order and restricted to Port Elizabeth  until last fall.    Five were released last October under President Frederik W. De Klerk's pledge  to start negotiations with black leaders. The most prominent is Walter Sisulu,  former secretary general of the ANC, and regarded as Mandela's closest  associate. He was placed under restrictions until Feb. 2 when De Klerk  announced sweeping reforms.    The others freed last fall were Raymond Mhlaba, a trade union activist and  anti-apartheid worker; Andrew Mlangeni, a former newspaper writer and one of  the founding members of Umkhonto we Sizwe; Ahmed Kathrada, head of a left-wing  Indian organization and member of Umkhonto we Sizwe's high command; and Elias  Matsoaledi, a union activist and leading member of Umkhonto we Sizwe.

Foreign Minister Roelof F. (Pik) Botha announced the visit in a statement,  saying he and De Klerk will take up a longstanding invitation from Bush.

South Africa's international isolation began to thaw early this year when De  Klerk repudiated 40 years of apartheid and started talks with African National  Congress leader Nelson Mandela about a negotiated transition to democracy.    De Klerk was to have met Bush in June, shortly before Mandela began a  triumphant American tour, but he canceled when U.S. anti-apartheid groups  threatened to disrupt his visit.    The sources said De Klerk realizes he will still face protests but believes his  reform message will be an effective counter to opponents of his visit.    The most significant symbol of De Klerk's break with white Afrikaner tradition  was his request last week to his own National Party, which has ruled South  Africa without significant challenge since 1948, to open its doors to blacks.

An editorial by the newspaper GRANMA, official organ of the  Central Committee of the Communist Party of Cuba, salutes the  electoral triumph of the African National Congress (ANC) in the  South African elections which, with its victory, has crowned the  process sealed in the fierce fighting of Cuito Cuanavale in  Angola.    GRANMA says that, the historic battle and defeat suffered by  the racist army in the face of the resistance of the Angolans  and Cuban international fighters changed the correlation of  forces in South Africa and led to the current triumph of the  South African people.    Regarding the struggle and merits of ANC leader Nelson  Mandela, the paper states that when he assumes his nation's  presidency, the world will have occasion to render tribute to  his wisdom, courageous revolutionary stance, and unwavering  principles.    It can be seen in all its dimensions that the triumph  corresponds to those who struggle and the example offered must  be again appreciated. The value of this example is heightened  at this shameful moment when so many have lowered their flags  and have repented for what they once were, it states.    The newspaper criticizes the regime of racial discrimination  that existed in South Africa, noting that capitalism and  imperialism were responsible for instilling in that state the  notion of superior and inferior races.    We are proud to have been and to continue to be close  companions of arms of Nelson Mandela and of the South African  people, the GRANMA editorial concludes.     "

Final      Part P; Page 2; Column 4; Late Final Desk      302 words      BLACK ACTIVIST DIES IN SOUTH AFRICAN JAIL      From Associated Press      JOHANNESBURG, South Africa      A black man accused of involvement in guerrilla attacks was found hanged in his  cell, police said today. He reportedly was a former lover of jailed black  leader Nelson Mandela's daughter.    Within hours of the police announcement, President Frederik W. de Klerk ordered  a judicial inquiry into the death, a step not taken after scores of previous  incidents in which black activists died while in police custody.    According to local newspapers, the 20-year-old man, Clayton Sithole, was a  former lover of Zindzi Mandela and the father of her child.    There was no immediate comment from the Mandelas, but associates of the family  said they believe the report is accurate.    Sithole and four other suspected African National Congress guerrillas were  arrested Friday in Soweto, the vast black township outside Johannesburg. Police  accused the group of killing 10 people, including two policemen, in attacks  with hand grenades and automatic rifles over the last two years.    Police said Sithole was found hanging from a shower pipe Tuesday in his cell at  John Vorster Square, Johannesburg's central police station. The police said an  investigation into the death had started and would include a post mortem by a  state pathologist.    Within a few hours of the police statement, Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok  announced that De Klerk had appointed an inquiry commission headed by a judge  to investigate Sithole's death.    Audrey Coleman, a prominent human rights activist, welcomed de Klerk's move,  saying she could not recall such a swift and emphatic response to any of the  scores of other deaths of detainees which she has monitored in recent years.    She said Sithole's family, who suspected the young man had been mistreated,  would hire a pathologist of their own to conduct an independent post mortem.

Mr Aylwin is being accused of emulating the dictatorial practices of his predecessor, General Augusto Pinochet. The spying scandal was disclosed by the Union of Independent Democrats (UDI), a small right-wing party best known for its loyalty to the former dictator. The scandal has allowed UDI to recapture the moral high-ground after being taunted for failing to defend human rights during Gen Pinochet's rule. 'This government was elected to correct the errors of the past, not to repeat them,' Mr Jovino Novoa, UDI's president, said at the weekend. The government has not contested the veracity of the classified documents that fell into the hands of its opponents. Mr Horacio Toro, chief of Investigaciones, the civilian police force, was forced to resign on Friday. President Aylwin wrote to him saying: 'Instructions issued under your orders . . . have gravely damaged the credibility of this government in the field of civil liberties.' Few Chileans believe, however, that Mr Toro acted on his own initiative. UDI has called for a parliamentary inquiry to determine who gave Mr Toro his orders. The police chief's immediate boss is the home secretary, Mr Enrique Krauss, who is one of President Aylwin's closest advisers. The documents revealed by UDI gave details of instructions to a 'special branch' of Investigaciones to report monthly on the activities of the government's political and trade union opponents, including their family lives. Of particular interest was a 'Falcon Plan' to keep tabs on Gen Pinochet's meetings with business leaders and politicians.  The Financial Times   London Page 2  "

Speaking on his arrival at  Johannesburg's Jan Smuts Airport on Monday [9 May] morning, Mr  Hurd said he was in the country to show Britain's support for a  new South Africa, which will be launched symbolically on Tuesday  with the presidential inauguration of Nelson Mandela. He told  reporters he would visit British-aided projects in the East Rand  townships on Monday. Future British Government support would  continue to focus on South Africa's needs, he said.    Croatian Prime Minister Nikica Valentic, who also arrived  for  Mr Mandela's inauguration, said South Africa had shown it was  possible to satisfy diverse interests in a positive way. ""We  are a country that has emerged from war. The message (from  South Africa) is political solutions have to be sought by  peaceful means,"" he said.    Former British Prime Minister Lord James Callaghan said  South  Africa would be an example to the rest of Africa. Asked if he  had a message for South Africa, Lord Callaghan said ""South  Africa is going to work out its own destiny"".    Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto was one of the most  outspoken of the VIPs who streamed in to the airport at a steady  rate on Monday. Of the inauguration she said: ""This is a  wonderful moment, not just for South Africa but for the world.""    Ninety-one delegations from around the world were due to  arrive on Monday. Representatives from Italy, Portugal, Malta,  Spain and Finland had arrived already and included Spain's heir  to the throne, Portuguese President Mario Soares and Finland's  President Martii Ahtisaari.

0,FT921-9952 ,"FT921-9952 _AN-CBIAHADXFT 920208   FT  08 FEB 92 / Mandela seeks to calm investors      By CAROLINE SOUTHEY, ANDREW GOWERS and TRACY CORRIGAN   MR NELSON MANDELA made a determined effort yesterday to reassure the international business community about the economic policies of a post-apartheid South Africa. In an interview with the Financial Times, the president of the African National Congress served notice of a fundamental review of his organisation's stance on nationalising key industries, and urged foreign companies to visit South Africa to investigate investment opportunities. He also sought to clarify the ANC's attitude to South Africa's external debt and hinted that a new government might try to reschedule loan payments. 'Without the support of business we cannot solve our economic problems,' he said. 'Nationalisation is like a sword of Damocles hanging above those who want to invest. So long as nationalisation is our policy, we will not attract investors.' Mr Mandela's comprehensive review of economic policy came at the end of a week in which the ANC's credibility took a severe knock as a result of apparently conflicting signals on the economy. While the 73-year-old nationalist leader held a series of meetings in Europe with senior businessmen and politicians, including talks with Mr John Major in London yesterday, his assurances about foreign investment and loans were contradicted by statements from ANC headquarters in Johannesburg. Yesterday, however, speaking at Heathrow airport before his return to Johannesburg - and days before the second anniversary of his release from 27 years of imprisonment - Mr Mandela sought to assert his authority over ANC policy. He denied there was any discrepancy between his statements and those issued at headquarters. In a formal statement, which had apparently been cleared with other ANC leaders, he said the ANC accepted 'that a future democratic South Africa had an obligation to service the debts which were incurred by the present regime . . . before financial sanctions were imposed by the international community.' But the statement added: 'The terms of repayment of such loans may be renegotiated to ensure that a democratic government is not unduly burdened by foreign debts incurred by an illegitimate regime.' Mr Mandela did, however, criticise efforts by Pretoria to raise capital through international bond issues, saying they amounted to sanctions busting. He also reiterated the ANC's plea for maintenance of economic sanctions, although most have already been dropped. Lending to South Africa by private-sector institutions is not prohibited. But banks cut off credit lines to South Africa in 1985 and Mr Mandela believes this hastened apartheid's collapse. He is trying to impede the government's access to international capital markets until an interim government is installed to oversee democratic elections. Foreign financial institutions arranging bond issues on behalf of South Africa, said Mr Mandela, singling out German banks, were 'undermining the negotiation process in South Africa. If they have a genuine interest in South Africa they would put pressure for the immediate installation of an interim government of national unity in South Africa'. Borrowing is a particularly sensitive issue in light of the current all-party negotiations on South Africa's future. The ANC believes that new loans will bolster the position of President F W de Klerk and reduce the pressure for reform. Mr Mandela's comments on nationalisation seemed designed to set the tone for a review of what has been a central and controversial plank of ANC thinking since 1955. This, he said, was likely to be discussed at a policy conference in April, though it is far from clear that this will resolve the matter. The ANC leader said he had concluded that a nationalisation programme was likely to alienate business after discussions with top executives in South Africa and abroad, and recent conversations with world leaders, includinging Li Peng, the Chinese prime minister, and President Francois Mitterrand of France.

Belgrade (from VJESNIK's permanent correspondent)--What was  published in previous weeks by Belgrade's DUGA, revealing which  of the prominent and influential Serbs withdrew foreign exchange  deposits after the collapse of Dafiment Banka, and who ""secretly  dined"" with bank owner Dafina Milanovic, receiving valuable  gifts from her (jewelry, automobiles, foreign exchange), was all  just a dramatic overture to the real political hurricane that  has been raging in Serbia since Saturday, and which was caused  by the weekly SRPSKA REC and Danica Draskovic, the wife of  opposition leader Vuk Draskovic, and both a director and  columnist in the newspaper.    The new issue of SRPSKA REC published on the title page a  receipt from Dafiment Banka saying that the wife of the Serbian  president, Mirjana Markovic, withdrew 278,000 Swiss francs from  that bank, and also published receipts with the amounts  withdrawn by Marko Milosevic (son of the Serbian president),  Prime Minister Mirko Marjanovic, former Prime Minister Nikola  Sainovic, new customs director Mihalj Kertes, Police Minister  Zoran Sokolovic, opposition leader Vojislav Kostunica, General  Director of Serbian Radio-Television Milorad Vucelic, that  company's reporter Stefan Grubac, and chief editor of TV  Politika Aleksandar Tijanic and his deputy Bogdan Tirnanic. The  same list also includes Dragomir Draskovic, nominally the head  of the SKPJ [expansion unknown], as well as Ljiljana  Habjanovic-Djurovic, a DUGA reporter who is famous as the one  who initiated the financial and political scandal known as  ""Dafimentgate.""    Prohibitions, Pressures, Threats    Back on Friday, an unprecedented commotion was raised over  the first announcement of the ""hot"" list that SRPSKA REC would  print the next day. First Tijanic and Vucelic refused to  broadcast a paid television ad when they heard what that  newspaper was bringing on the front page, and then the head of  the POLITIKA firm Zivorad Minovic, prohibited distribution of  the newspaper through POLITIKA's sales network, even though  SRPSKA REC and Minovic have a signed contract on marketing.  Later, on the only available television channel, Studio-B,  Danica Draskovic appeared and testified about the pressures and  threats to which she and the entire editorial staff had been  subjected. ""Tijanic told me, `Finally I will put you in jail and  you will never get out of it. We will destroy you and that  vermin from your newspaper,"" Danica Draskovic stated, recalled  that SRPSKA REC had been banned twice before, both times when it  wrote something about the Milosevic-Markovic couple and their  alliance with crime. Or, as Danica Draskovic said in Sunday's  BORBA, ""It is not a case of an alliance between politics and  crime. The same people are both politicians and gangsters. By  day they destroy cities, engage in ethnic cleansing, rape,  slaughter, and rob. In the evening they justify all those  terrors by saying it is in the national interest, and at night,  they count their war booty and transfer it abroad. The ballots  of the ruling party and its backup parties coincide with  Interpol warrants and the list of the International Tribunal for  War Criminals. The Knin-Pale-Dedinje-Cyprus line is the most  frequent European financial line,"" Danica Draskovic said.    Even though he gave exceptional publicity on his television  station to the scandal over Dafiment, which was initiated by  DUGA, without questioning at all the credibility of DUGA's  facts, and praising DUGA's courage for exposing how prominent  Serbs were robbing the people, Aleksandar Tijanic, in addition  to threatening Danica Draskovic, hurried to accuse SRPSKA REC of  forgery on his television station. ""Danica's list is a carefully  arranged cocktail of names of people who are either her  political opponents or reporters who wrote in a principled  manner about those who took the money of small depositors. She  wants to turn a financial scandal into a political one,"" Tijanic  stated.    Along with that very interesting observation by Tijanic,  according to which the previous coverage was principled, and  ""Dafimentgate"" was only a financial scandal until it was taken  up by SRPSKA REC (which, by the way, cites the committee of bank  creditors, as well as DUGA), which expanded the list of those  who loved Dafina to the last mark, there are also Tijanic's  words that neither he nor Bogdan Tirnanic were Dafina's  depositors, and that he will sue Danica Draskovic for slander.  ""All those who withdrew money after the bank's collapse,  including Danica, will end up in court, or in a  sanatorium--Danica herself can choose. Bogdan and I will demand  compensation in the amount that she stole from Dafina and we  will return that money to the people. And we will send packages  to Danica, wherever she is, in jail or a lunatic asylum,""  Tijanic announced furiously from the screen of his television  station.    Panic in the Government Leadership    How much panic seized the very leadership of the Serbian  authorities because of SRPSKA REC's revelation that the  Milosevic family was also very directly involved in the scandal  is also indicated by the fact that ""from the very top,"" Kostadin  Pusara (head of the team for consolidation of Dafiment Banka)  received an order to comb through immediately and publicly,  without approval from the judicial bodies that had sole  jurisdiction, the list of several hundred thousand of Dafina's  depositors. The result of Pusara's instant check on Tijanic's  television station, and on Sunday in the newspaper of the same  name under the title ""Danica Draskovic's Forgery,"" was expected:  No one in Milosevic's family ever invested in that bank, nor did  any of those cited by SRPSKA REC (Pusara made the only exception  for DUGA reporter Ljiljana Djurovic, because, he said, ""I have  not managed to check her yet""): SRPSKA REC's receipts ""are  certainly not credible,"" and consequently Pusara ""does not doubt  at all that the judicial authorities will clear up that media  hysteria over the bank,"" especially now that the state has  decided that Dafiment will not go into bankruptcy, but rather  continue operating, which ""obviously does not suit certain  profiteers.""    Where Should the Minister of Justice Stick His Nose?    Who is it that is not suited by discovering the truth about  the undeniable alliance of the state and crime, not just in the  case of Dafina Milanovic (who was in prison twice because of  embezzlement and forgery before Dafiment), but also in the case  of the fugitive Jezdimir Vasiljevic, and the ministerial  scandal, never cleared up in the courts, that awkwardly  coincided with the violent death of two directors of Jugodrvo  (it had to do with oil, the most profitable business in a  country under an embargo), and about the operating licenses for  hundreds of quasi-banks and savings banks that were closed only  after they freely robbed the people for two years, and about  Seselj's Radicals, who were frantically persecuted during the  election campaign and arrested on charges of crimes and war  crimes, but all suddenly freed when Seselj threatened that he  would also reveal certain secrets from the period of flirting  with the Socialists?    That is actually not an issue for anyone. It is clear that  Serbia could not finance the war (wars!) or survive under the  embargo without the assistance of the mafia (domestic and  international), which, for the needs of the state, has grabbed  up foreign exchange, installed the black market, developed deals  in oil, arms, and cigarettes, laundered money.... That this sort  of question is extremely naive and inappropriate is best  illustrated by Serbian Constitutional Court Judge Slobodan  Vucetic, who recently stated, ""If a law-governed state were born  overnight, by some chance, the jails and border crossings would  be too crowded,"" to which one can add a comment by one Belgrade  attorney: ""I don't know whether the minister of justice dares to  stick his nose in anything but his handkerchief.""

Mr Mandela's speech to parliament in Cape Town, which was broadcast live nationwide, marked the 100th day of the multi-party government of national unity. It was billed as an attempt to reassure his mass constituency that he would not put the demands of potential investors and nervous whites above the needs of those disadvantaged by apartheid. 'Millions have suffered deprivation for decades and they have the right to seek redress. They fought and voted for change; and change the people of South Africa must have,' he told members of parliament, who gave him a standing ovation when he entered the chamber. While judging the government's first 100 days a success, he stressed that 'at the end of the day, the yardstick that we shall all be judged by is. . . are we, through our endeavours, creating the basis to better the lives of all South Africans?' But the speech gave little detail of proposed socio-economic development projects, and included almost no new initiatives to promote that goal. It was couched in language which would not be readily accessible to a township audience, focusing more on the process of managing change than on the kind of eye-catching programmes demanded by an impatient electorate. He made only a passing reference to the country's desperate need for millions of new homes. Housing is the most politically explosive issue facing the new government, and is a significant focus of the Reconstruction and Development Programme, the government's umbrella plan for socio-economic development. A white paper on the programme is expected to go to the cabinet soon.   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.   Industries:-  P9111 Executive Offices.     P9199 General Government, NEC.

0,FT921-9774 ,"FT921-9774 _AN-CBJBRADEFT 920210   FT  10 FEB 92 / Answers that need repeating: FT writers talk to Nelson Mandela about the ANC's policies on issues such as nationalisation      By RICHARD LAMBERT, ANDREW GOWERS, CAROLINE SOUTHEY and MICHAEL HOLMAN   MR NELSON Mandela has a credibility gap, and he knows it. Fresh from rubbing shoulders with the elite at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, the African National Congress (ANC) president wryly recalled the group discussions. 'They put all these questions, on nationalisation or violence, and I would deal with them. At the end they would clap.' Mr Mandela paused, smiled ruefully, and added: 'The following day, the same people raised the same questions. In spite of their ovations, I had to start all over again.' His Davos message - rethinking nationalisation, encouraging foreign investment in a post-apartheid South Africa, honouring external debt - had not been helped by apparently conflicting reports from Johannesburg. In his London hotel room last Friday, on his way home, Mr Mandela spoke to the Financial Times about a controversial week. During a two-hour exchange he revealed his growing doubts about nationalisation. He remained inflexible in his support for economic sanctions. He repeated his personal preference for a coalition government, 'even assuming the ANC is returned with an overwhelming majority'. Sometimes he gave the impression of making policy on the hoof, as in his comments about alternatives to nationalisation. Sometimes he seemed ingenuous, taking at face value welfare donations from big business. But it was a remarkable performance: vigorous, articulate and good humoured. Most of the questions raised, whether in Davos or by the FT, are not new. But as South Africa moves closer to a post-apartheid government, in which the ANC will have the prominent role, the answers become more pertinent. It is two years ago tomorrow that the world's most famous political prisoner walked free after 27 years in detention. Political power is now moving from the white house of assembly to the multi-party Convention for a Democratic South Africa (Codesa), where negotiations over an interim government are on the verge of a breakthrough, says Mr Mandela. The ANC president has been central to the process, with President FW de Klerk. Neither man, however, can be entirely confident that his constituency will hold up as the transition unfolds. Mr de Klerk's ruling National Party is losing ground to the extreme right. Mr Mandela has to keep an eye on the left wing of the ANC, and an angry young generation who are impatient for radical change. But while the white right fears majority rule, it does not differ from Mr de Klerk on economic issues. For many black South Africans, however, economic policy could determine their vote: state take-over of industry is synonymous with rapid redistribution of wealth; and repudiating apartheid's debts can be readily justified. Last week, these two critical issues came under rigorous scrutiny, both by Mr Mandela's black constituency and the business community. Mr Mandela's reassurances at Davos were, it seemed, being questioned by both blocs at home. A draft of Mr Mandela's main address obtained by a Johannesburg weekly business magazine contained a section - dropped from the final text - which advocated putting 'some key enterprises into public ownership'. And no sooner had Mr Mandela told delegates at Davos that an ANC government would honour external debts, than the ANC publicity department in Johannesburg promptly raised doubts. It issued a statement implying that the ANC might not, in fact, honour loans made to the 'present illegitimate South African regime and its agencies'. New foreign borrowing had to await the installation of a multi-racial interim government. Since the main advocate of this view within the ANC is said to be Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, the party's secretary general and viewed as a potential successor to the 73-year-old Mr Mandela, the warning was significant. Mr Mandela tried to put the record straight in London. Mr Ramaphosa - 'a young man of considerable ability destined to occupy a very important position in our political life' - had not been accurately quoted. 'He accepts the fact that it would be a disaster,' the ANC president said, 'to say we would not pay the debts entered into by the regime.' But while some questions were answered, uncertainties remained. A statement issued on Friday by Mr Mandela accepted 'an obligation to pay foreign debts . . . incurred by the present regime in the normal course of administration before financial sanctions were imposed by the international community'. What, anxious creditors might ask, was 'the normal course of administration' under apartheid? Recent South African bond issues, the statement continued, are 'totally unacceptable', an attempt to 'bust financial sanctions adopted by the international community'. Mr Mandela was asked what sanctions were being busted. 'The sanctions which have hit South Africa most are the financial sanctions,' he replied, 'because they cannot get loans from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank . . . Banks which have now given a loan to South Africa are breaking those very sanctions.' Mr Mandela is right in his reference to the IMF and the World Bank. But the bond issues do not contravene any law other than the one the ANC leader went on to enunciate: 'We have recommended to the international community that sanctions be applied against South Africa by everybody. And anybody therefore who violates those sanctions is not acting in the interests of the people of South Africa as interpreted by us.' If Mr Mandela seemed unrealistic on the issue of economic sanctions, most of which have been repealed, his comments on nationalisation suggested a fundamental change. The legacy of apartheid 'cannot just be addressed through stimulating economic growth', he argued. 'Without state intervention, it is impossible to achieve redistribution.' Two years ago, most ANC officials - including Mr Mandela - would have said nationalisation was the answer. Some officials still do. But Mr Mandela, citing advice from world leaders with credentials which he must hope will satisfy even the most radical of black South Africans, appears to have undergone a change of heart. The collapse of communism has strengthened the hand of critics of nationalisation, he said. 'What is more, we have had discussions with people like Li Peng, (prime minister of the Peoples Republic of China,) and they have given us a different scenario. 'Li Peng, the head of a Marxist state, has said that difficulties which they faced with their economy induced them to reduce state participation . . . and they are considering other measures to reduce the involvement of the state. Now that was a big shock]' exclaimed Mr Mandela, relishing his anecdote and the chuckles from his audience. Vietnam 'was even more disillusioning to us', revealed Mr Mandela, who is inclined to use the Thatcher 'we'. A senior minister told him how Vietnam had allowed 'more scope to private enterprise and to reduce state participation. Very cautiously, very diplomatically, he suggested to us that we had to examine the question of nationalisation. 'We want to attract investment,' he continued, 'but nationalisation is the sword of Damocles hanging above the heads of the people who want to invest. . . As long as nationalisation is our policy, it is clear to me that we are not going to attract investors.' He gave a clear indication of his thinking on nationalisation: the ANC should 'be able to (achieve redistribution of wealth) without nationalisation'. He suggested that he would prefer to redress the legacy of apartheid in other ways: tax reforms, partnerships with the private sector and by encouraging land redistribution through a land bank. He was aware that a battle might be looming at the ANC policy conference next April. 'I am not saying that my colleagues will be convinced that the time has come to abolish nationalisation.' But he will tell them that they have to choose between nationalisation and foreign investment. As at Davos, however, Mr Mandela may have to repeat his message before it gets through.

By JAMES RISEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER      DETROIT      In a widening scandal that has rocked the Detroit Police Department, federal  investigators are probing whether cash from a million-dollar secret police fund  earmarked for narcotics investigations went to pay the rent on the posh Beverly  Hills home of the daughter of Detroit's police chief.    The apparent diversion occured at a time when Detroit police were so short of  cash that undercover officers were paying for street-level buys of crack  cocaine out of their own pockets.    The scandal has become a major embarrassment for a city suffering under a  plague of drug-related crime, where residents often complain about the police's  inability to rid their neighborhoods of crack houses and drug-dealing gangs.    A mounting public outcry over the case has led several City Council members to  call for the suspension of Police Chief William Hart, who has already had  control of the secret fund taken from him by Detroit Mayor Coleman A. Young.    That action came in the wake of allegations that Hart's daughter had $72,000 in  rent paid over two years on her Beverly Hills home by companies controlled by  the mysterious central figure in the scandal, Kenneth Weiner, a former civilian  deputy chief of police in Detroit.    Weiner's California-based companies had contracts with the Detroit police that  were paid out of the secret drug-purchase fund.    Hart has denied knowing anything about Weiner's rent payments for his daughter,  and city officials say it is still not clear whether any money from the  drug-purchase fund went for the rent payments. But investigators for the FBI  and the Internal Revenue Service, working with a federal grand jury, are now  trying to determine exactly what happened to the money from the secret fund,  and are trying to track down the elusive Weiner.    The scandal has received so much attention in the Detroit media that Stephen  Markman, the U.S. attorney for Detroit, took the unusual step last week of  acknowledging the existence of a federal investigation into the case.    ""The circumstances of the investigation surrounding the Detroit Police  Department have been extraordinary,"" Markman said, in explaining why his office  confirmed its probe.    A former college professor and reputed expert on anti-terrorism, Weiner served  as a civilian anti-terrorism expert for the Detroit police until 1986, when a  federal investigation of his allegedly questionable investment activities in  suburban Detroit forced him to resign, city officials say.    Hart and Mayor Young are now seeking to distance themselves from Weiner, and  agreed Monday night to turn over checks and other financial records from the  secret fund that the Detroit City Council had demanded for its own  investigation.    Young has refused to take Hart off active duty during the investigation. ""The  Mayor still stands by Chief Hart,"" Bob Berg, Young's spokesman, said. ""There  has been a lot of innuendo, but you are presumed innocent until you are proven  guilty.""    Young blasted the local media's coverage of the police probe last week,  charging that it amounted to a ""crucifixion"" of Hart. On Monday, an  organization of black Detroit police officers also gave their backing to Hart,  charging that he had been treated unfairly by the press.    But Young's critics on the City Council believe that the police department  cannot conduct an adequate internal investigation while Hart remains on the  job.

Mr Ohmae, chairman of the Japanese operations of McKinsey and Co, management consultants, is a household name in Japanese business after publishing more than 30 books on management. He describes his group, dubbed The Reform of Heisei, as a grass-roots organisation which will offer a third choice between the ruling Liberal Democratic party and the Socialist parties. The grouping will promote the reform of Japan's political institutions by offering to support politicians who endorse its goals. A reform of the electoral system widely blamed for encouraging politicians to seek illegal corporate donations is likely to be a central issue for the group. Mr Ohmae was named the nation's most influential leader of public opinion by a recent survey of more than 700 prominent Japanese. Mr Ohmae's group is unlikely to stage a significant challenge but it could provide a focal point for the public outcry of the Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin scandal which has exposed links between LDP leaders, allegedly corrupt businessmen and organised crime syndicates. The initiative is likely to put pressure on the LDP to offer more far-reaching proposals for political reform. The scandal has led to a vicious power struggle within the LDP. A two-week stalemate between the LDP and the opposition parties over which LDP leaders should testify to the parliament over their involvement in the affair has delayed passage of the supplementary budget needed to implement the Y10,700bn (Pounds 57bn) emergency spending package announced in August. There were signs last night that the parties were edging towards a compromise on the testimony issue to allow debate on the budget to proceed.  The Financial Times   London Page 4  "

The move follows widespread contamination with lead oxide of the tangy spice Hungarians use to flavour and colour their food. The ban is expected to last for 7-10 days, the government said. More than 40 people have had hospital treatment for poisoning. The police believe some vendors have been using red pigment containing high quantities of lead oxide to enhance the colour of low quality paprika or paprika substitutes. The police said yesterday they were holding 18 people in connection with the case. Ms Erzsebet Schreiber, deputy head of the food product department at the national quality control institute said: 'This is the worst case of food contamination we know of in Hungary. 'The paint has been mixed with poor quality paprika or other paprika substitutes and sold as the real thing,' she said. Traces of the toxic substance had been found in around 15 per cent of paprika sold in unsealed, unmarked containers which the institute has tested. Hungary produces about 10,000 tonnes a year of paprika, which is made from dried red peppers. Around 55 per cent is exported, accounting for up to 6 per cent of world production. The government stressed that toxic substances had not been found in foods due for export. Mr Zoltan Bertha, head of the red pepper growers association, blamed the paprika poisoning on 'adventurers' who entered the industry in the hope of quick profits after the state monopoly was dismantled in 1991. Vendors fear the bad publicity from the poisoning would affect sales and exports for years to come. 'I sell mainly to tourists,' one vendor said, pointing to a basket of fancily packaged paprika costing Ft2,200 (Pounds 12.90) per kilo. 'This scandal could hurt our national image.

0,FT924-10320 ,"FT924-10320 _AN-CKAABADEFT 921031   FT  31 OCT 92 / Miyazawa urges political clean-up: Japan is slipping deeper into political and economic crisis - The Politics      By CHARLES LEADBEATER and ROBERT THOMSON   THE Japanese government has become gridlocked in the wake of the Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin scandal while the economy is facing a severe slump, Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, warned the Japanese parliament yesterday. Mr Miyazawa told an extraordinary session of the Diet there was an urgent need to restore public trust in politics, which had fallen to an all time low. A newspaper poll this week showed the cabinet's approval rating fell by 10 points over the last month to a low of 23 per cent. The slump is mainly a reflection of the scandal which has provoked a vicious power struggle at the top of the ruling Liberal Democratic party. This follows the resignation of Mr Shin Kanemaru, the party's powerbroker who admitted receiving an illegal donation of Y500m from Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin, a trucking company with links to organised crime syndicates. The Diet session, which has been convened for 40 days, will start by focusing on the scandal towards the end of next week. Opposition parties are demanding that Mr Noboru Takeshita, the former prime minister and titular head of the LDP's largest faction, should testify over his role in the affair. Mr Takeshita's testimony could further destabilise the party leadership. Mr Miyazawa issued a ringing denunciation of the current political system: 'I am unalterably resolved to work for far-reaching political reform to eliminate the root causes that have bred today's distrust of politics, including ensuring greater transparency of political funding and facilitating elections contested over policy issues and political activity that does not require vast sums of money.' However, the reform plan which the government has agreed with the main opposition parties falls well short of demands made by leading reformers. The plan would reapportion several Diet seats from rural to urban areas, strengthen the political ethics council, force Diet members to make a fuller disclosure of their assets and allow illegal contributions to be confiscated. Mr Miyazawa called on the LDP and the opposition to continue talks on the more far-reaching reforms to the electoral system and political funding which would he said would be needed to meet public criticism. Mr Miyazawa responded to the uncertainty created by next week's US presidential election by stressing that relations with the US would remain the cornerstone of Japanese foreign policy. However, he said Japan would increasingly develop Asian foreign policy initiatives which would lead Japan into a political role in resolving disputes in the region as well as providing financial assistance. Japan would not waver from its Russian policy that bilateral financial aid would be increased only once the dispute over the Kurile Islands was settled and a peace treaty was signed.

0,FT923-3642 ,"FT923-3642 _AN-CIKCNAAFFT 920911   FT  11 SEP 92 / Mandela agrees to talks with de Klerk on political violence      By PATTI WALDMEIR      JOHANNESBURG   THE African National Congress last night pulled back from the brink of confrontation with the South African government by agreeing that Mr Nelson Mandela, the ANC leader, should accept Pretoria's invitation to meet President FW de Klerk to address the question of political violence. The decision to hold talks with the government over violence which earlier this week claimed the lives of more than 20 people in the Ciskei black homeland represents a victory for the moderate faction of the ANC, which is committed to negotiating a new constitution for South Africa. It was an important move to defuse one of the country's most serious political crises since Mr de Klerk launched his political reform programme in 1990. During a two-day meeting of the policymaking national working committee of the ANC, which ended last night, powerful voices within the organisation's leadership were raised in favour of halting negotiations altogether, and pursuing mass protest actions to weaken the government. However, leading moderates won the day, arguing that Mr Mandela should meet Mr de Klerk, subject to the fulfilment of certain conditions. These included the release of remaining political prisoners, the banning of dangerous weapons in public and action to reduce violence emanating from hostels in black townships. Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, the ANC secretary-general, said he was ready to meet Mr Roelf Meyer, the minister of constitutional development, as early as today to prepare for a summit between the ANC and National party leaders. He said ANC leaders would welcome a visit from a UN representative to mediate in the crisis - a move proposed earlier in the day by Mr Pik Botha, foreign minister.

No shots have been fired, no inner-city  buildings torched, and no arrests have been made. The streets of Miami's  predominantly black neighborhoods are calm.    Yet, for business leaders in this city that has been rocked by three bloody  civil disturbances in the past 10 years, this disciplined revolt may be the  most wrenching of all. It has certainly been the toughest to quell.    Over the past four months, at least 13 national organizations have canceled  plans to hold conventions in Miami in support of a boycott called by black  leaders to protest officials' refusal to honor anti-apartheid hero Nelson  Mandela during his visit here last June. Among groups that have scrapped plans  to meet here are the National Assn. of Black Social Workers and the American  Civil Liberties Union.    The boycott has cost at least $5 million in lost convention and tourism  business, Dade County officials say, and the figure could be as high as $14  million.    But damage to the economy and national image of South Florida is not all the  boycott has produced. Black leaders also point to a surge in African-American  pride as a minority population that for 30 years has seemed to lose ground to  the influx of Latinos, especially from Cuba, begins to appreciate its  potential.    ""For a long time it was thought that the only way for blacks to get attention  in Miami was to strike matches,"" says Marvin Dunn, a sociology professor at  Florida International University and a black activist. ""But now we are seeing  the potential for political gains. Right now there is a lot less anger and a  lot more pride, and that speaks to a certain maturing in the black community.""    Establishment leaders do not dispute that blacks, who make up about 20% of  greater Miami's population, have -- by any measure of economic, political or  social power -- long been depressed. But, they say, gains have been made,  especially since the devastating 1980 riot in Miami's Liberty City and Overtown  sections.    Some have been stunned by the boycott's effects. ""We are being held hostage,""  says William O. Cullom, president of the Greater Miami Chamber of Commerce,  ""and we don't deserve that. I have congratulated (boycott organizer) H.T. Smith  for his well-conceived plan. But there is only so long you can rub someone's  nose in the dirt. He should declare victory . . . before more innocent people  get hurt.""    The boycott was proposed by the Black Lawyers Assn., of which Smith is a  founding member, after what many viewed as a snub of Mandela when he addressed  a labor convention in Miami Beach last summer. Although Mandela was widely  honored elsewhere during his 10-day U.S. tour, the mayors of Miami, Miami Beach  and Hialeah withdrew an official proclamation of welcome after the African  National Congress leader praised support given him by Cuban President Fidel  Castro.    In predominantly Cuban Miami, where a failure to denounce Castro is often  considered suspect, saying anything positive about the Cuban leader is  traitorous.    But in spurning Mandela, the Latino and non-black leadership of Miami touched  off a backlash of nonviolent protest that has not only proved expensive, but  has united the black community as never before. On Election Day last month,  black activists called for a school and work boycott to protest the choice of a  Cuban-American over a veteran black educator for the vacant Dade County schools  superintendent's post. Thousands stayed home.    ""There is such a sense of pride in our community right now,"" says the Rev.  Victor Curry, a supporter of both the school and tourism boycotts.    In recent weeks, Miami's power brokers became even more concerned after Smith  previewed a 14-minute ""Boycott Miami"" video, which includes footage of police  clubbing Haitian demonstrators and compares the treatment of blacks here to  their treatment in Selma, Ala., in the 1960s. The tape includes a snippet from  Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s ""I Have a Dream"" speech, and points out that while  Mandela was denied an official greeting, a key to the county was recently  awarded to Robocop, a fictitious movie android.    Smith has announced plans to send the video to some 1,000 businesses,  convention planners and even travel agents. It could also be sent to the  National Football League, which has already been asked by Smith not to consider  Miami for the 1993 Super Bowl.    Many see the video as extortive. Smith denies that. ""That videotape is nothing  more than a compilation of news stories that have happened here,"" he says,  adding that a date for distributing the video has not been made. ""It is not  meant to be a threat.""    But the video is viewed as a threat, especially by Cullom and others monitoring  the boycott's economic effects on tourism, Miami's major industry. Last year  tourism brought $5.6 billion into Dade County. ""In three of four years,"" says  Cullom, ""the damage this is doing to the community will be in the billions of  dollars.""    James K. Batten, chairman of Knight-Ridder Inc., which owns the Miami Herald,  told a business group last week that the boycott was responsible for ""poisonous  messages about Miami (being) pumped out into the rest of America and the world,  (which) cannot be retrieved once the boycott is over.""    Smith and other black leaders have set several conditions for ending the  boycott. They are asking for:     -- Increased opportunities for black professionals, especially in tourism.     -- Immigration reform that would benefit Haitians.     -- A review of police procedures in the black community.    But before any negotiations on those issues can begin, Smith insists that the  mayors or city commissions of the three cities that snubbed Mandela must  apologize.    Cuban-born Miami Mayor Xavier Suarez flatly refuses to do that. In recent  weeks, Suarez has spent hours being interviewed and writing newspaper op-ed  pieces about the controversy, emphasizing city programs aimed at black economic  development.    But while allowing that he ""regrets"" the offense taken by many blacks over the  lack of official welcome of Mandela, Suarez insists that Mandela's ""visit to  Miami Beach did not require, did not request and did not provide for any  official reception. What, then, is there to apologize about?""    Miami Beach Mayor Alex Daoud has also refused to issue an apology, saying he  wasn't even invited to meet Mandela. But it is Suarez, a Cuban-American who is  beholden to a large constituency of staunch anti-Castro voters, who is  considered key to breaking the impasse.    As popular as the boycott has been among blacks, it has not received unanimous  support. T. Willard Fair, president of the Urban League of Greater Miami, has  urged the national organization to go ahead with its convention, beginning here  Wednesday. But at least 18 chapter presidents have declined to attend, saying  they will respect the boycott.    Smith, a 43-year-old trial lawyer, says he is surprised and encouraged by the  impact of the boycott, which was aimed at tourism not only because it is the  largest industry here but because ""they've been boycotting us for years -- they  just never called a press conference to tell us.""    ""We have got the power brokers' attention. I believe they underestimated us,""  he said. ""But we were well prepared with a calculated campaign that we thought  would take four to six months. We are making progress.    ""We are not out to destroy the economy,"" Smith says. ""We want to share in the  economy. We are not vindictive. We would like to see this thing over. But it  has got to end with dignity. The boycott will end when the apology is made and  other conditions are met. There will be no surrender.""

The show of solidarity was to have begun with  a rally addressed by ANC President Nelson Mandela and Namibian  President Sam Nujoma in Windhoek on January 27, but Mr Mandela  cancelled his visit. ANC spokesman Gill Marcus said the ANC  President had other engagements.    SWAPO Secretary-General Moses Garoeb said senior ANC and  SWAPO officials would address meetings and rallies across  Namibia to raise money for the ANC's election coffers. He said  SWAPO's support for the ANC was part of the responsibility it  felt towards South Africa. SWAPO was confident of, and hoped for  an ANC landslide victory and felt a need to contribute in the  same way the ANC had helped SWAPO to victory in the 1989  Namibian elections.    Mr Garoeb said SWAPO believed the ANC, with its ""pragmatic  and experienced leadership"", was the party best structured to  manage a post-election South Africa and keep southern Africa  stable.    Money would be raised at SWAPO branch and regional level in  cooperation with the National Union of Namibian Workers. Mr  Garoeb appealed to all South Africans living in Namibia to  register and vote for the ANC on April 27.    In an editorial on Monday, the Windhoek Advertiser warned  that SWAPO's support for the ANC risked drawing Namibia into a  partisan role in a potential future civil war. ""In the event of  a troubled South Africa plunging into civil strife of  proportions where factions go over to guerrilla war and  unrestricted sabotage, Namibia will not be spared. Our  allegiance with the ANC will under such circumstances be on the  debit side of Namibia's interests,"" wrote editor Hannes Smith.    Mr Garoeb dismissed Mr Smith's comment as the ""cry-baby  attitude and professional negativism from a confirmed pessimist""  who could not see anything good about the SWAPO government.     "

Cabinet members, the four NP provincial leaders and  provincial premiership candidates were at the meeting, NP  spokesman Danie du Plessis said.    The meeting will also discuss NP representation in  provincial  governments.    On Tuesday, Mr de Klerk will meet African National Congress  President Nelson Mandela, who is almost certain to be sworn in  as South Africa's first black state president.    Mr Mandela has said the composition of the cabinet in the  Government of National Unity would be chosen at his discretion.    In terms of the constitution, however, Mr Mandela is obliged  to include in his cabinet members of opposition parties that  obtained more than five per cent of the national vote.    As the results stood on Monday, the NP with more than 30 per  cent of the vote qualified for six cabinet posts and the Inkatha  Freedom Party for one.    ANC spokesmen indicated at the weekend that even if parties  did not obtain five per cent of the vote they could be  represented in the cabinet in the interests of creating an as  broadly representative cabinet as possible. They named Freedom  Front [FF] leader Gen Constand Viljoen whose FF had almost four  per cent of the vote as a possible candidate.    The constitution also stipulates that the second biggest  party is entitled to nominate one of two executive deputy state  presidents, one of whom is certain to be Mr de Klerk.    Other names mentioned as possible contenders for cabinet  posts are Minister of Constitutional Development Roelf Meyer,  Cape NP leader Dawie de Villiers, Minister of Justice and  Defence Kobie Coetsee, Minister of Foreign Affairs Pik Botha and  Minister of Finance Derek Keys.    Mr de Klerk's cabinet meets again on Wednesday, perhaps for  the last time as the NP government.     "

The report, prepared by federal and Jewish officials, added that attempts to  get the money back have been unsuccessful.    After the January, 1988, death of Werner Nachmann, the 62-year-old chairman of  the Central Council of Jews in Germany, investigators found that he had run a  massive embezzlement scheme involving reparations paid by the West German  government.    It is the largest scandal to hit West Germany's Jewish community and led to  calls for greater supervision of governmental funds intended as reparations for  Jewish survivors of the Nazi terror.

According to him, representatives of the  executive and the presidential institution passed secret  information about the Petromin fleet to Greek intelligence  General Nikos Grylakis [name as published]. In that context the  PD-FSN deputy named Paul Teodoru, current transportation  minister, and [General] Vasile Ionel, counselor of President Ion  Iliescu. The presidential counselor is supposed to have  personally handed over a file containing secret information to  the Greek general. Basescu claims that the information had been  previously obtained from Petromin Director Romanuel Posedaru.    Until now the representatives of the government, as well as  those of the presidential institution, have not officially  denied anything.    The press remained speechless when it learned about the  accusations of such gravity. If the accusations are sustained  by evidence, the Petromin-Forum Maritime scandal will eventually  be cleared up by simply revealing the details of an espionage  affair the perpetrators of which are top officials in Bucharest  and Athens.

The persons directly  accused or merely hinted at by Basescu are: General Nikos  Grylakis, the man who in 1993 triggered ""the scandal of the  century"" in Athens, Stellos Katounis, owner of the Forum  Maritime company, and the Palestinian Fathi Mohamad Taher [name  as published], the owner of the Elite restaurant in Bucharest,  the Greek business adversary of the previous two persons, the  shipping tycoon Iannis Alafouzos, who also owns a number of  radio and television networks, while on the Bucharest side of  the affair they are Paul Teodoru and General Vasile Ionel. On a  secondary plane the names of Konstandinos Mitsotakis, the former  prime minister of Greece, Nicolae Vacaroiu, the head of the  executive in Bucharest, and Ion Iliescu have also been mentioned.    If Basescu's allegations are true, the center figure of the  whole affair is General Grylakis. His career came to an end in  September 1993, previous to which he held the office of Prime  Minister Mitsotakis' counselor for security and defense issues.  Born on the isle of Crete he later graduated from the Military  Academy and the War Academy. He was specially trained by the  Mosad (Israel's intelligence service.) During the 1967 military  dictatorship he was the head of the Greek secret service. In  1989 he organized an illegal network to tap the telephone  conversations of various Greek political figures and gather  information about them. Three years ago he set up the Bureau  for Balkan Affairs. He had contacts with many Balkan leaders.  He publicly claimed that he supported and influenced things to  have Ion Iliescu elected as president. For that service,  according to the Greek press, in 1993 he received a medal in  Bucharest. Iliescu does not deny this. In the same year Premier  Vacaroiu invites him to Snagov to celebrate the conclusion of  the Petromin-Forum Maritime deal. He is a friend of Stellos  Katounis and the Palestinian Taher (both of whom have very tight  business connections with Moscow), and an enemy of Andreas  Papandreou, the current Greek prime minister, and of Alafouzos,  the influential shipping tycoon, who last September managed to  bring General Grylakis to justice.    In the same month [September 1993] our daily already  signaled, for the first time, that he is involved in the  Petromin-Forum Maritime deal. From first-class Greek sources  (who for the time being wish to remain anonymous) we learned  that immediately after ""the scandal of the century"" erupted in  Athens, General Grylakis made an unexpected move: In exchange  for the extinguishing of the conflict he offered a number of  confidential documents to his adversaries. Among those  documents was the file referred to by Basescu and which contains  evidence regarding the involvement of top Romanian officials in  an espionage affair. In those documents Grylakis describes in  detail the persons from whom he obtained classified information  and how.    Basescu's accusations are so serious that they place the  Romanian intelligence services in a difficult position. The  Foreign Information Service, the Romanian Intelligence Service  [SRI], and UM 0215 (the Intelligence Service of the Ministry of  Interior) are now compelled to urgently provide answers to the  Romanian public.

The tight timetable underscores the government's concern about the damage being caused by an ever widening scandal over embezzlement of intelligence funds and a deliberate campaign by members of the intelligence community to denigrate ministers as well as President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro. The scandal took a new turn yesterday when Mr Alessandro Voci, head of the domestic intelligence service (Sisde) from August 1991 to July 1992, resigned as special administrator of the dissolved Rome city council following allegations of involvement in misusing Sisde funds. Mr Ciampi proposed last month to merge domestic intelligence (Sisde) with military intelligence (Sismi) in a single body controlled directly by the cabinet office and answerable to parliament. But he is handicapped because the shake-up of so sensitive an area requires a broad political consensus and was not part of his brief when he agreed to become premier in May. The reforms risk provoking a controversy with the Christian Democrats who have controlled the interior ministry - responsible for domestic intelligence - since 1946. This is the only portfolio to have been held by one party throughout the post-war era. Mr Ciampi revealed that funding for the intelligence services had been L696bn (Pounds 289m) in 1992, of which L359bn was on a secret unaccountable basis. This year the budget is expected to be L724bn. Until now, these funds have been spent without any accountability, and more than 14 former Sisde employees are now accused of having syphoned off money for their own purposes. An equally serious allegation being investigated by Rome magistrates is that part of these secret funds were used to supplement senior officials' expenses. Two former interior ministers and Mr Nicola Mancino, the current minister, are due to give evidence to magistrates today on this issue. A further allegation is that secret funds have been used to pay kidnap ransoms at politically sensitive moments, although the law formally forbids such payments.   Countries:-  ITZ  Italy, EC.

Commission chairman Mr Justice D A Melamet  said at a press conference in Pretoria the report also  recommended that all allowances, other than car allowances, be  abolished.    Free housing would be given only to the president and the  two  executive deputy presidents and no other housing allowances  would be allowed for any other grades. According to the report,  ""if any person occupies a state house, a market-related rental  is to be paid to the state to cover such occupation"".    ""The committee has worked on the premise that all elected  membe ay income tax on their income as is the case with members  of the public. It, however, believes and recommends that the  right in relation to the pensions of an ex-state or  ex-vice-president and their spouses should continue to exist and  should not be taxed,"" Mr Justice Melamet said.    The new state president will receive R575,000 [rand]  (R409,000 after deductions) a year, and his deputies R500,000  (R338,247). The figures do not include allowances. Asked if  the amount was in line with what President-elect Nelson Mandela  had been preaching, that his salary would not be excessive, Mr  Justice Melamet said Mr Mandela and the present cabinet had  approved the salary scale. ""In fact Mr Mandela was happy with  the recommendations of the commission because he would be taxed  and treated like any other member of the public,"" Mr Justice  Melamet said.    He said the scale was in line with that of international  countries and his committee, which was made up of people from  various sectors, was sure the scale was comparable with that of  the private sector. According to Mr Justice Melamet the  committee, in its recommendations, used a number of principles  to provide a basis for remuneration in the parliamentary system.  These included that the system should attract the best people  available for parliamentary duty; encourage individual growth  and participation in work teams and parliamentary committees;  encourage parliamentary work as a career; and provide for  transparency of the principles and pay involved.    The committee recommended a grading structure of the various  offices in the national legislature and for the new offices  provided for in the Constitution Act of 1993. It recommended  that all allowances where applicable, other than car allowances,  be abolished and incorporated in the basic salary attributed to  each post in the grading system. Parliamentarians, other than  the state president and executive deputy president, are to be  entitled to two free journeys a month for private use during a  parliamentary session between their home base and back.    Each incumbent is entitled to an allowance in respect of a  private motor car (which can also be used for official purposes)  of 20 per cent of the basic salary of the incumbent.    The committee also recommended that a pension fund along the  lines of those existing in the private sector be established for  politicians and had made further recommendations on the  envisaged pension dispensation. It was, however, pointed out  that certain provisions of the 1993 Constitution had to be  amended to enable the introduction of the pension arrangement  recommended.    According to the commission it was also noted that the  present medical benefit scheme was operating successfully and,  although the contributions were high, the benefits were  generous. The committee recommended that the medical scheme be  continued and made a number of recommendations for the  consideration of the scheme's management committee to bring  costs more in line with commercial schemes.    According to Mr Justice Melamet, the commission has also  drafted a bill for the establishment of a permanent commission  on remuneration of representatives envisaged in sections of the  constitution of the Republic of South Africa. ""More  specifically the bill deals with matters relating to the objects  of the (permanent) commission, its constitution, remuneration,  powers, duties and functions as well as meetings of the  commission, the funding of its activities and the powers of the  president,"" Mr Justice Melamet said.

Early this morning, the Cuban leader visited Mandela at his  official residence where they held talks behind closed doors.    In statements made yesterday to the press, Fidel Castro  pointed out that the rise to power of the African National  Congress (ANC) opens new possibilities of cooperation between  the two countries. ""Probably with no other country is there the  possibility of such broad Cuban cooperation than with South  Africa, as we work on developing fraternal and heart-felt ties  between both peoples,"" Castro said.    After meeting with Mandela, the Cuban head of state granted  an exclusive interview to SBC (South Africa Broadcasting  Company), the local television network, at the Arcadia Hotel  where he is staying with the rest of the high-level delegation  that accompanied him.    Concerning his first visit to this southern African nation,  whose Army clashed with Cuban troops in the struggle for  independence of Angola and Namibia, Fidel Castro said: ""There  are two South Africas and two periods in the history of South  Africa. There was a period of strong confrontation, but now  there is a new South Africa where there is peace, respect, and  affection for Cuba.""    The statesman confirmed he has been treated very  respectfully  by all sectors of society, not just the ANC, during his visit  here that began last Monday. We should all contribute to  harmony and peace in South Africa, he said, so that the results  of efforts and sacrifices will make this country a model for the  entire world.    He also appeared very emotional at Mandela's inaugural  ceremony which brought together more than 5,000 people in the  Union Building's amphitheater, where there were heads of state  and heads of government from approximately 40 countries.    Today, Fidel Castro ends his visit to South Africa, where he  also met with more than 20 leaders and representatives from  Africa and the Middle East.     "
0,FT934-13364 ,"FT934-13364 _AN-DJVCQAA0FT 931022   FT  22 OCT 93 / Two arrested as construction scandal widens      By WILLIAM DAWKINS      TOKYO   JAPAN'S construction industry scandal widened yesterday when prosecutors arrested two branch executives of Kajima, one of the country's top contractors, on suspicions of bribery. This means prosecutors have arrested executives from all of Japan's top six contractors, suspected of paying bribes to get local government building contracts. Kajima is Japan's second largest construction group in sales, but is the most politically influential, thanks to the many former government officials it employs. Mr Akira Miyazaki, Kajima's president, yesterday said he believed the pair had made illegal political donations, but head office was not involved. Prosecutors also raided the home of a Kajima vice-president to gather evidence. The latest arrests add fresh weight to US allegations that the Japanese construction market is rigged against foreign competition. They come in the final weeks before the US-imposed November 1 deadline after which Washington has threatened to apply trade sanctions against Japan unless the construction market is made more open. Washington's main complaint is against the designated bidding system, whereby a local government chooses companies suitable to tender for a contract. Companies not designated have no right to bid. This is blamed as a factor in the kind of corruption of which Kajima is suspected. Legal and illicit construction industry donations are a traditionally large source of political campaign funds. The two Kajima branch managers arrested, Kazumi Suzuki and Ichiro Takagi, are suspected of handing Y10m to the former mayor of the northern town of Sendai, Mr Toru Ishii, last year. Mr Ishii has already been charged with receiving bribes from four other contractors, Shimizu, the industry leader, Hazama, Nishimatsu Construction and Mitsui Construction. A senior executive of Taisei, another construction group, has also been held. 'This just shows how endemic the construction industry problem has become,' said Mr Graeme McDonald, analyst at James Capel Pacific. As in previous arrests, the Kajima inquiry is based on evidence gathered from the papers of Mr Shin Kanemaru, former political godfather of the Liberal Democratic Party. His arrest in March on charges of tax evasion on donations from the construction industry contributed to the LDP's election defeat after 38 years in power.

By DAVID LAUTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER      WASHINGTON      The faces in the crowd are the same: eager and expectant -- that mixture of awe  and hope in the gaze of people who have waited hours for a chance to touch the  hand or hear the words of a hero.    Only the heroes have changed. The objects of Americans' adulation have  developed a distinctly foreign cast.    Over the last few months, Lech Walesa and Mikhail S. Gorbachev have made  triumphal tours across America that no domestic figure seems able to equal.    Now it is Nelson Mandela -- cheered by a million New Yorkers this week,  showered by confetti in a ticker-tape parade on Broadway and saluted at rallies  as he began a tour of America.    Is the American hero now an import?    For most of this century, American heroes have been just that -- American.  Franklin D. Roosevelt, Dwight D. Eisenhower, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., John  Glenn -- each excelled in a different sphere. But all were seen as embodying  central aspects of the American character and were placed on the exalted  platform that the nation reserves for its most admired figures.    In recent years, by contrast, America has been marked by a deep cynicism about  its domestic political figures and institutions, said David Riesman, a retired  Harvard social historian. In arenas as varied as sports, politics and  entertainment, idols have turned out to have feet of clay.    At the same time, Americans in the final decade of the 20th Century are  bombarded with celebrity, as Daniel J. Boorstin, formerly the librarian of  Congress, noted in his book, ""The Image.""    ""Celebrity-worship and hero-worship should not be confused,"" Boorstin wrote.  ""Yet we confuse them every day,"" and ""by doing so we come dangerously close to  depriving ourselves of all real models.""    Because they are unable to identify real domestic heroes among the mass of  instant celebrities, Americans naturally gravitate to foreigners who seem to  display heroic characteristics such as courage, decisiveness and mastery of  fate.    ""There's almost gratefulness to these people for existing,"" Riesman said. ""We  still want to look up to people. We're not as cynical as we sometimes like to  make out we are.""    There are no exact measures of the breadth of these new heroes' appeal. Each  has tailored his U.S. visit to cities where his appeal would likely be  greatest, as UC Berkeley political scientist Raymond E. Wolfinger noted.    Thus Polish labor leader Walesa visited Chicago, with its huge Polish-American  community. Soviet President Gorbachev visited Minneapolis and San Francisco,  two of the most liberal cities in the nation. South Africa's Mandela is  visiting a series of cities with large black populations.    The eagerness of national politicians to get close to the visitors, the  attentiveness of the news media, the vast enthusiasm of the crowds and the  results of public opinion polls all indicate that the impact has been real and  considerable.    That impact has been possible because of both a dearth of home-grown heroes and  a shift in how Americans view the nation's position in the world.    The decline of home-grown heroes has many possible causes.    Boorstin argues that the cult of celebrity has drowned out the possibility of  authentic heroes. The whirl of stars, each rising fast and most falling just as  fast, along with the widespread commercialization of popular entertainment,  have changed the way Americans view many aspects of mass culture.    Consider sports, to take one example. Basketball player Michael Jordan is  probably the best-known sports star in the nation. Americans know him both as a  player and as a commercial symbol for such products as Wheaties and Nike. He  earns a huge income, far more than ever dreamed of by Babe Ruth or Joe  DiMaggio. But neither Jordan nor any other athlete of today seems able to  command the broad public affection that was lavished on Ruth and DiMaggio.    Few Frontiers    Those who conquered new frontiers traditionally became American heroes. Daniel  Boone, Davy Crockett, Kit Carson and ""Buffalo Bill"" Cody went west. Later  heroes crossed the frontiers of air and space: Charles A. Lindbergh with his  solo flight across the Atlantic, Glenn with the first American orbit of the  Earth.    Today, those frontiers seem constrained, said Michael Lofaro of the University  of Kentucky, who has studied heroes in American literature. Heroes are far  harder to develop, he said, in an age when ""the great man has been replaced by  the machine.""    Political figures have provided another source of heroes in eras past. But,  today, said historian William C. Leuchtenberg of the University of North  Carolina, politics is dominated by ""men in gray flannel suits"" who simply fail  to excite.    The only recent political figure who approached hero status is former President  Ronald Reagan. In the latter part of his term, however, Reagan lost  considerable standing because of the Iran-Contra scandal.    After leaving office, Reagan appears to have fallen victim to the defect that  has plagued many other would-be American heroes -- commercialization. The  multimillion-dollar fee he received last year for a brief speaking tour in  Japan detracted from his image as a man who transcended the worldly concerns of  ordinary Americans.    The news media's intense concentration on the private lives and scandals of  popular figures may also play a role in knocking down American heroes as fast  as they can rise.    Former Sen. Gary Hart of Colorado might never have become a heroic figure even  if the press had not reported on his interest in women other than his wife  during his 1988 campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination. But, as  biographers have since disclosed, earlier political figures, such as President  John F. Kennedy, had similar sexual peccadilloes that were not reported at the  time.    The absence of domestic heroes leaves a void. As Riesman said, heroes are an  essential part of every culture, reassuring the public that something exists  that is larger than life.    Boundaries Fall    America's changing role in the world has made that void easier to fill from  abroad.    Foreign heroes are not entirely new. After a wave of mostly unsuccessful  revolutions swept Europe in 1848, some of the leading insurrectionaries -- the  Lech Walesas of their day -- toured America, the land of democracy and  revolution, seeking support. Lajos Kossuth, the leader of Hungary's failed  attempt to free itself from Austria, attracted 100,000 people, who lined the  railroad tracks from Columbus to Cleveland to cheer him as he toured Ohio,  still a frontier state, in 1852.    A century later, Sir Winston Churchill became one of the most widely admired  men in America for his brave leadership of Britain in the fight against Nazism.    Those events, however, have been exceptions. More often, Americans have been  notable for a feeling that theirs was a country that would find little to learn  and even less to admire in the ""Old World.""    Indeed, those who were thought to cleave to non-American role models were often  subjects of suspicion. During the 1960 presidential campaign, Kennedy was  forced to defend himself against charges that his Roman Catholic faith would  subject him to dictation from a foreign Pope. Jews were often suspected of  possessing a dual loyalty to the United States and Israel that placed their  patriotism under suspicion. During the height of the Cold War, that wariness of  foreigners became entwined with fear of communism to produce a generalized  suspicion of ""outside influences"" in much of American society.    That resistance appears to have faded, at least among substantial parts of the  American population. An increased amount of travel abroad, widespread  television pictures from overseas and the increased celebration of ethnic  diversity at home have combined to make Americans more open to foreign  concepts, said Berkeley's Wolfinger.    At the same time, said Stanford sociologist Seymour Martin Lipset, Americans  once more see the world as being open to them and their values.    Until very recently, Mandela, for example, might have made many Americans  nervous. Although American opinion generally has opposed apartheid for years,  the African National Congress' ties to the South African Communist Party and  its guerrilla tactics made many Americans uneasy.    But now concerns about communism have sharply diminished. Even the leader of  the Soviet Union, which no longer seems poised to launch its nuclear missiles,  can be praised in the United States for pursuing greater freedom and openness  -- what many Americans see as ""their values.""    Projection of those values onto a public figure is at the heart of how a hero  is created. Throughout history, heroes have been concocted of fact mixed with  large amounts of fantasy and hope. Indeed, one of the major deterrents to the  development of new American heroes may be the relentlessness of the modern  publicity apparatus, which renders nearly everything accessible and leaves  almost nothing mysterious.    By contrast, although satellite television pictures and overseas newspaper  correspondents bring foreign figures unprecedented amounts of public  recognition within the United States, foreign leaders still remain sufficiently  veiled behind a curtain of distance and unfamiliarity that they leave something  to Americans' imagination.    Skepticism Fades    When Gorbachev came to power in 1985, Americans initially viewed him as being  cut from the same cloth as his predecessors, said Jeffrey C. Alexander,  chairman of UCLA's sociology department, who has studied the development of  Gorbachev's public image. Within the first year, however, Americans, and  particularly their news organizations, began to describe Gorbachev as  pragmatic, dynamic, informal, spontaneous and self-confident.    That in turn appears to have influenced American policy. Public confidence in  Gorbachev has tempered domestic pressure on the Bush Administration to take a  tough line with the Soviets over the Lithuanian crisis, for example. White  House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater attracted criticism when he referred to the  Soviet leader last spring as a ""drugstore cowboy,"" and Bush now routinely  praises Gorbachev.    The process has been even more striking in Mandela's case.    ""For the broad American public, we didn't know who this man was,"" said pollster  and political consultant Paul Maslin. In the last few years, Mandela's name  became known to some Americans, particularly blacks, but little was known of  his history. For nearly 28 years, his words and ideas had reached the outside  world only sporadically and through the intermediaries who were allowed rare  visits with him in prison.    Strangest of all in this video age, no one outside of a small circle of  intimates had seen his face.    And then, in pictures watched by hundreds of millions of people around the  globe, Mandela walked out of prison in a scene that almost perfectly  recapitulated essential elements of ancient myths about heroes who dramatically  return from long exile to save their people.    For most Americans, the specifics of Mandela's ideas and the details of his  policies remain obscure and, perhaps, not even relevant. When asked by  reporters why they turned out to see him, people in the crowds commonly used a  phrase that applies more to the United States than to Africa: civil rights.    For many Americans, black and white, Mandela has become ""a 1990 version of  Martin Luther King,"" Maslin said.    That connection could become the key to how the country greets the African  National Congress leader as his tour of the nation continues. Mandela began  entering the American consciousness primarily as a hero for black Americans. He  was part of a long tradition of ethnic heroes -- nationalist leader Eamon de  Valera for Irish-Americans earlier in this century, for example, and the late  Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir for Jews.    More recently, however, Mandela has emerged as a hero with a broader reach. As  an apostle of a future cleansed of racism, Mandela fills a void for many white  Americans who, since King's assassination in 1968, haven't had ""a black leader  they can unambivalently admire,"" said Anne Fabian, who teaches American studies  at Yale University.    ""Mandela makes us feel good about ourselves,"" said UCLA's Alexander. ""He's  raising a dream of a multiracial society; that's what we're celebrating.    ""We don't know what the person is like, so we're really thinking about our own  society,"" he said. ""These heroes are projections of what we think they are or  what we'd like to become. That's why we create them.""

At the same time, Americans in the final decade of the 20th Century are  bombarded with celebrity, as Daniel J. Boorstin, formerly the librarian of  Congress, noted in his book, ""The Image.""    ""Celebrity-worship and hero-worship should not be confused,"" Boorstin wrote.  ""Yet we confuse them every day,"" and ""by doing so we come dangerously close to  depriving ourselves of all real models.""    Because they are unable to identify real domestic heroes among the mass of  instant celebrities, Americans naturally gravitate to foreigners who seem to  display heroic characteristics such as courage, decisiveness and mastery of  fate.    ""There's almost gratefulness to these people for existing,"" Riesman said. ""We  still want to look up to people. We're not as cynical as we sometimes like to  make out we are.""    There are no exact measures of the breadth of these new heroes' appeal. Each  has tailored his U.S. visit to cities where his appeal would likely be  greatest, as UC Berkeley political scientist Raymond E. Wolfinger noted.    Thus Polish labor leader Walesa visited Chicago, with its huge Polish-American  community. Soviet President Gorbachev visited Minneapolis and San Francisco,  two of the most liberal cities in the nation. South Africa's Mandela is  visiting a series of cities with large black populations.    The eagerness of national politicians to get close to the visitors, the  attentiveness of the news media, the vast enthusiasm of the crowds and the  results of public opinion polls all indicate that the impact has been real and  considerable.    That impact has been possible because of both a dearth of home-grown heroes and  a shift in how Americans view the nation's position in the world.    The decline of home-grown heroes has many possible causes.    Boorstin argues that the cult of celebrity has drowned out the possibility of  authentic heroes. The whirl of stars, each rising fast and most falling just as  fast, along with the widespread commercialization of popular entertainment,  have changed the way Americans view many aspects of mass culture.    Consider sports, to take one example. Basketball player Michael Jordan is  probably the best-known sports star in the nation. Americans know him both as a  player and as a commercial symbol for such products as Wheaties and Nike. He  earns a huge income, far more than ever dreamed of by Babe Ruth or Joe  DiMaggio. But neither Jordan nor any other athlete of today seems able to  command the broad public affection that was lavished on Ruth and DiMaggio.    Few Frontiers    Those who conquered new frontiers traditionally became American heroes. Daniel  Boone, Davy Crockett, Kit Carson and ""Buffalo Bill"" Cody went west. Later  heroes crossed the frontiers of air and space: Charles A. Lindbergh with his  solo flight across the Atlantic, Glenn with the first American orbit of the  Earth.    Today, those frontiers seem constrained, said Michael Lofaro of the University  of Kentucky, who has studied heroes in American literature. Heroes are far  harder to develop, he said, in an age when ""the great man has been replaced by  the machine.""    Political figures have provided another source of heroes in eras past. But,  today, said historian William C. Leuchtenberg of the University of North  Carolina, politics is dominated by ""men in gray flannel suits"" who simply fail  to excite.    The only recent political figure who approached hero status is former President  Ronald Reagan. In the latter part of his term, however, Reagan lost  considerable standing because of the Iran-Contra scandal.    After leaving office, Reagan appears to have fallen victim to the defect that  has plagued many other would-be American heroes -- commercialization. The  multimillion-dollar fee he received last year for a brief speaking tour in  Japan detracted from his image as a man who transcended the worldly concerns of  ordinary Americans.    The news media's intense concentration on the private lives and scandals of  popular figures may also play a role in knocking down American heroes as fast  as they can rise.    Former Sen. Gary Hart of Colorado might never have become a heroic figure even  if the press had not reported on his interest in women other than his wife  during his 1988 campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination. But, as  biographers have since disclosed, earlier political figures, such as President  John F. Kennedy, had similar sexual peccadilloes that were not reported at the  time.    The absence of domestic heroes leaves a void. As Riesman said, heroes are an  essential part of every culture, reassuring the public that something exists  that is larger than life.    Boundaries Fall    America's changing role in the world has made that void easier to fill from  abroad.    Foreign heroes are not entirely new. After a wave of mostly unsuccessful  revolutions swept Europe in 1848, some of the leading insurrectionaries -- the  Lech Walesas of their day -- toured America, the land of democracy and  revolution, seeking support. Lajos Kossuth, the leader of Hungary's failed  attempt to free itself from Austria, attracted 100,000 people, who lined the  railroad tracks from Columbus to Cleveland to cheer him as he toured Ohio,  still a frontier state, in 1852.    A century later, Sir Winston Churchill became one of the most widely admired  men in America for his brave leadership of Britain in the fight against Nazism.    Those events, however, have been exceptions. More often, Americans have been  notable for a feeling that theirs was a country that would find little to learn  and even less to admire in the ""Old World.""    Indeed, those who were thought to cleave to non-American role models were often  subjects of suspicion. During the 1960 presidential campaign, Kennedy was  forced to defend himself against charges that his Roman Catholic faith would  subject him to dictation from a foreign Pope. Jews were often suspected of  possessing a dual loyalty to the United States and Israel that placed their  patriotism under suspicion. During the height of the Cold War, that wariness of  foreigners became entwined with fear of communism to produce a generalized  suspicion of ""outside influences"" in much of American society.    That resistance appears to have faded, at least among substantial parts of the  American population. An increased amount of travel abroad, widespread  television pictures from overseas and the increased celebration of ethnic  diversity at home have combined to make Americans more open to foreign  concepts, said Berkeley's Wolfinger.    At the same time, said Stanford sociologist Seymour Martin Lipset, Americans  once more see the world as being open to them and their values.    Until very recently, Mandela, for example, might have made many Americans  nervous. Although American opinion generally has opposed apartheid for years,  the African National Congress' ties to the South African Communist Party and  its guerrilla tactics made many Americans uneasy.    But now concerns about communism have sharply diminished. Even the leader of  the Soviet Union, which no longer seems poised to launch its nuclear missiles,  can be praised in the United States for pursuing greater freedom and openness  -- what many Americans see as ""their values.""    Projection of those values onto a public figure is at the heart of how a hero  is created. Throughout history, heroes have been concocted of fact mixed with  large amounts of fantasy and hope. Indeed, one of the major deterrents to the  development of new American heroes may be the relentlessness of the modern  publicity apparatus, which renders nearly everything accessible and leaves  almost nothing mysterious.    By contrast, although satellite television pictures and overseas newspaper  correspondents bring foreign figures unprecedented amounts of public  recognition within the United States, foreign leaders still remain sufficiently  veiled behind a curtain of distance and unfamiliarity that they leave something  to Americans' imagination.    Skepticism Fades    When Gorbachev came to power in 1985, Americans initially viewed him as being  cut from the same cloth as his predecessors, said Jeffrey C. Alexander,  chairman of UCLA's sociology department, who has studied the development of  Gorbachev's public image. Within the first year, however, Americans, and  particularly their news organizations, began to describe Gorbachev as  pragmatic, dynamic, informal, spontaneous and self-confident.    That in turn appears to have influenced American policy. Public confidence in  Gorbachev has tempered domestic pressure on the Bush Administration to take a  tough line with the Soviets over the Lithuanian crisis, for example. White  House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater attracted criticism when he referred to the  Soviet leader last spring as a ""drugstore cowboy,"" and Bush now routinely  praises Gorbachev.    The process has been even more striking in Mandela's case.    ""For the broad American public, we didn't know who this man was,"" said pollster  and political consultant Paul Maslin. In the last few years, Mandela's name  became known to some Americans, particularly blacks, but little was known of  his history. For nearly 28 years, his words and ideas had reached the outside  world only sporadically and through the intermediaries who were allowed rare  visits with him in prison.    Strangest of all in this video age, no one outside of a small circle of  intimates had seen his face.    And then, in pictures watched by hundreds of millions of people around the  globe, Mandela walked out of prison in a scene that almost perfectly  recapitulated essential elements of ancient myths about heroes who dramatically  return from long exile to save their people.    For most Americans, the specifics of Mandela's ideas and the details of his  policies remain obscure and, perhaps, not even relevant. When asked by  reporters why they turned out to see him, people in the crowds commonly used a  phrase that applies more to the United States than to Africa: civil rights.    For many Americans, black and white, Mandela has become ""a 1990 version of  Martin Luther King,"" Maslin said.    That connection could become the key to how the country greets the African  National Congress leader as his tour of the nation continues. Mandela began  entering the American consciousness primarily as a hero for black Americans. He  was part of a long tradition of ethnic heroes -- nationalist leader Eamon de  Valera for Irish-Americans earlier in this century, for example, and the late  Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir for Jews.    More recently, however, Mandela has emerged as a hero with a broader reach. As  an apostle of a future cleansed of racism, Mandela fills a void for many white  Americans who, since King's assassination in 1968, haven't had ""a black leader  they can unambivalently admire,"" said Anne Fabian, who teaches American studies  at Yale University.    ""Mandela makes us feel good about ourselves,"" said UCLA's Alexander. ""He's  raising a dream of a multiracial society; that's what we're celebrating.    ""We don't know what the person is like, so we're really thinking about our own  society,"" he said. ""These heroes are projections of what we think they are or  what we'd like to become. That's why we create them.""      Non Dup      HEROISM; ROLE MODELS; UNITED STATES -- CULTURE; AMERICANS; MANDELA, NELSON R;  GORBACHEV, MIKHAIL S; WALESA, LECH; CELEBRITIES    "

Mr Nelson Mandela, African National Congress leader, acted quickly to try to head off the threat of revenge for the attack near the offices of the ANC and Pan Africanist Congress. The blast killed one ANC election candidate and damaged the organisation's offices. In a statesmanlike speech, which included a string of overtures to the white community, Mr Mandela appealed to his supporters to concentrate on the importance of tomorrow's elections to end nearly 350 years of white domination, and not on the killings in Johannesburg. 'Leave the task of maintaining law and order to the security forces,' he pleaded with a crowd of more than 100,000 supporters at his last campaign rally in the Natal city of Durban. In a separate incident, gunmen shot dead four ANC supporters and wounded 19, as they travelled to the rally in Durban, state radio said. President FW de Klerk, in a warning to the white far-right, condemned the car-bomb attack in Johannesburg and said it would not stop the country's first all-race elections. 'There is no possibility that radical minorities will be allowed to frustrate the will of the vast majority of the South African people.' However, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi of the mainly Zulu Inkatha Freedom party, closing his campaign, warned the blast was more evidence that the elections would be unfair: 'This is just another thing to point out there will not be free and fair elections in South Africa.' Police and bomb disposal experts said it was too early to say who staged the attack. But the location and the nature of the explosion suggested it was the work of the white right-wing, making a desperate last stand for apartheid and delivering a warning of the ferocity of their resistance to a non-white government. The bomb, estimated at between 80kg and 90kg of explosives, was the biggest in South Africa since an ANC bomb in Pretoria killed 17 people in 1983. If planted by white extremists, it marked a significant escalation of their violent opposition to political change. Hardline whites have set off several explosions in the past, mainly targeting small ANC rural offices, railway lines and electricity pylons. A suspected second car bomb in Johannesburg last night turned out to be a false alarm. Since the hardline whites were humiliated last month in the black homeland of Bophuthatswana, where they had gone to try to restore ousted President Lucas Mangope to power, the right has been curiously silent, raising hopes that it would not pose a serious threat to elections. Mr Mandela said the elections would usher in 'a new era of hope, justice, democracy and national reconciliation'. In an attempt to placate the right, the ANC on Saturday signed a deal with rightwing leader General Constand Viljoen which included agreement in principle to a 'volkstaat' or homeland for Afrikaners. Such a homeland will be created after the elections, if Gen Viljoen's Freedom Front party can show it has sufficient support for the concept. Votes will be counted separately in white areas to determine where a homeland would be located. Only handicapped, elderly and heavily pregnant voters will go the polls tomorrow.

Officials of the two sides said senior delegations from the ANC and Inkatha would meet 'as soon as possible' to finalise arrangements for a bilateral meeting between the two leaders. But officials of the National Peace Committee, which worked towards a meeting for weeks said it could still collapse. Asked whether the ANC had dropped pre-conditions it earlier set for meeting Chief Buthelezi - including agreement on fencing migrant workers' hostels and banning so-called traditional weapons such as clubs and spears, conditions rejected by Inkatha - the chairman of the National Peace Committee, Mr John Hall, said the preparatory teams would have to work this out. Mr Hall and other intermediaries, including western diplomats, have for months tried to persuade Mr Mandela and Chief Buthelezi to meet to address the problem of worsening township violence which has left 3,000 people dead this year alone. Mr Hall said he believed prospects for a meeting were better now than at any time in the recent past. The two men last met bilaterally nearly two years ago, but failed to reduce the level of violence between their supporters. Mr Hall said a meeting of all signatories to the National Peace Accord, including main political groups in South Africa, would also be held soon, adding this could pave the way for the resumption of multi-party talks on a new constitution. The ANC yesterday confirmed its more moderate position in those talks when its national executive committee endorsed power sharing in a government of national unity, even after a post-apartheid constitution is in place.

The decision on Monday by the homeland cabinet not to take part  in the April election appeared to add fuel to the stoppages.    ""The government is deeply concerned over the current unrest  and its possible impact on South African citizens and interests  and on the peaceful implementation of the election process,""  said a South African Government statement issued in Pretoria. It  said South Africa was keeping a close watch on the situation in  the homeland.    ""The government has once again addressed an urgent appeal to  the Bophuthatswana government to become a full participant in  the constitutional process, including the proposed election,""  the statement said.    South African Defence Force members, meanwhile, conducted  military excercises near Bophuthatswana borders, but defence  spokesman Maj Merle Meyer said they were not to prevent the  unrest spilling across the border.    The homeland government accused South African Foreign  Minister Pik Botha of fanning unrest in Bophuthatswana and  attempts by Ambassador Prof Tjaart van der Walt to mediate in a  labour crisis at the homeland's Broadcasting Corporation were  rebuffed.    After a day of police action against strikers in the  homeland, the Transitional Executive Council [TEC] recommended  financial strangulation of the government of President Lucas  Mangope, cancellation of Bophuthatswana's diplomatic ties with  Pretoria and other measures if the homeland flouted TEC  directives. The announcement came hours after African National  Congress [ANC] leader Nelson Mandela urged Pretoria to withdraw  its seconded officials to force Mr Mangope to step down.    ""I think we have now given him enough time. I have tried to  reason with him (Mr Mangope) but it is clear he has no vision.  Further pressures will be used and I have no doubt he will not  be able to withstand them,"" Mr Mandela told students at the  University of Venda.    In another development in a day of drama in Bophuthatswana,  the Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] said an IEC  delegation including chairman, Mr Justice Johann Kriegler, would  travel to Bophuthatswana on Wednesday for talks with the  homeland government.    As stoppages spread on Tuesday, strikers at the  Bophuthatswana Broadcasting Corporation [BBC] held hostage BBC  Chairman Eddie Mangope and Broadcasting Minister Zebulon Masilo  at the corporation's offices. Eddie Mangope is President  Mangope's son.    The hostage drama ended when homeland police stormed the  building anf fired tear gas at hundreds of workers who had taken  virutal control of the corporation. The strike over pay cut  radio and television broadcasts on Tuesday. Mr Eddie Mangope,  who earlier had told South Africa's ambassador he would resolve  the crisis on his own and did not need the intervention of the  diplomat, was found in the offices unharmed.    Between 10 and 20 strike leaders at the BBC were reported  arrested.    Later, Mr Eddie Mangope said in a statement the crisis had  been resolved following talks with the strikers and the BBC  would resume broadcasts on Wednesday morning. Confirmation of  this claim could not be immediately obtained. [passage omitted]    Striking civil servants are demanding participation in the  election process to ensure their pensions are protected under a  new government. Mr Mandela said on Tuesday an ANC government  would not seize the pensions.    On Tuesday scenes of violence were witnessed around the  capital Mmabatho with teargas being used indiscriminately by the  homeland authorities for most of the day.    The situation in Mafikeng and Mmabatho was tense on Tuesday  evening wih a pall of black smoke hanging over Mafikeng.    Burning barricades of rubbish were placed across the road in  streets in Monstshiwa township where groups of youths, armed  with rocks, stood on street corners.    There is fear of a rightwing backlash against the protesters  and some reporters were mistaken for white rightwingers. A  source close to the Bophuthatswana government told SAPA that  members of the Freedom Alliance had already offered ""to help  out"" in Bophuthatswana. This could not be independently  confirmed.    A number of journalists were manhandled by police and at  least two camera teams had their film confiscated. [passage  omitted]     "
0,FT944-1143 ,"FT944-1143 _AN-ELVDSAA1FT 941222   FT  22 DEC 94 / Pride and joy mask problems: Election of radicals to national executive committee sounds warning to new South African government      By MARK SUZMAN   As South Africa's President Nelson Mandela ended his address to the ANC conference's closing session yesterday, the 3,000 delegates broke into song and dance, full-throatedly rendering an old struggle song praising the virtues of Mr Mandela and their movement. The smiles on the faces of the president and his colleagues as they hugged each other on the podium, and the unrestrained joy and pride of party activists gathered from around the country, told the same story: despite fears of clashes between the national executive and local branches over the slow delivery on election promises and the government's conciliatory attitude towards whites, the ANC's first national conference since coming to power in April resulted in a broad endorsement of existing leadership. Despite a frank admission by Secretary-General Cyril Ramaphosa that the party had been unprepared for the complex task of being in government, and remained poorly organised and was losing membership, both he and Mr Mandela, the incumbent party leader, were re-elected unopposed. Meanwhile, the ongoing struggle between Mr Ramaphosa and Deputy President Thabo Mbeki over who is the most likely successor to Mr Mandela was resolved in favour of the Mr Mbeki; he was elected the party's new deputy president. While acknowledging it had been remiss in implementing pre-election promises, especially in areas such as housing and provision of basic services to black townships, the leadership won general support for its policies as the party resolved to make 1995, in the words of one delegate, 'the year of delivery'. Many of the ANC's best-known radicals, including Mr Mandela's estranged wife, Winnie, were all elected to top positions within the party's National Executive. But the overwhelming victories by Mr Jacob Zuma in the race for national chairperson and Ms Cheryl Carolus, as deputy secretary-general, a Zulu and a Coloured respectively, demonstrated a clear commitment to a broadly moderate and representative leadership. The only explicitly hardline position to come from the gathering was the insistence that the ANC modify somewhat the pre-election agreement guaranteeing white bureaucrats' jobs for the five-year life of the interim constitution. From ministers and local activists alike, the belief that the state bureaucracy was at best incapable of implementing party policy, and at worst deliberately sabotaging it, led to widespread calls for dramatically accelerated appointment of blacks to senior posts. The conference left several problems unresolved as Mr Ramaphosa's litany of structural weaknesses was met with little but a promise to do better. In the absence of a detailed programme to boost recruitment and funding, paid-up party membership is likely to wither further as the liberation fervour generated among blacks before the election continues to dissipate. The party sidestepped discussion on the future of its formal alliance with the Communist party and Cosatu, the country's biggest trade union federation. The linkage is less problematic than formerly - most ANC supporters have jettisoned all ideological baggage - but it will become increasingly hard to keep up if the government holds to its tough economic line on tariff reform and industrial restructuring. While these shortcomings, and the need to start implementing its centrepiece Reconstruction and Development Programme, will have to be dealt with over the coming year, the party and its leaders know these are the challenges of the future. For now, they are content to revel in the fact that, after 83 years of struggle, they finally have the political wherewithal to address them.   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.

Boesky calmly admitted today that he paid for inside information with  briefcases full of cash as Wall Street's most celebrated felon gave his first  public testimony since his 1986 plea bargain.    Testifying against former friend John A. Mulheren Jr. on securities fraud  charges, Boesky recounted the crimes he committed with other players in Wall  Street's insider trading scandal -- such as Dennis Levine, formerly with Drexel  Burnham Lambert Inc., and investment banker Martin Siegel.    ""Did you understand you were committing a crime when you traded on inside  information from Dennis Levine?"" Assistant U.S. Atty. Scott Gilbert asked.    ""Yes,"" Boesky said in a firm and loud voice.    Boesky, center of the biggest insider trading crime scandal in Wall Street  history, made his entrance through a back door of Manhattan federal court,  where he faced Mulheren and a packed courtroom. It was Boesky's first public  appearance since he was released early from a three-year prison term last  month.    Clean-shaven, with his white hair cropped short, Boesky wore a charcoal gray  suit, white shirt and dark tie.    Boesky testified that he received inside information about proposed takeover  attempts from Levine and Siegel, and that he had agreed to pay them up to 5% of  his firm's profits for their help.    He said he never gave Levine any money. Siegel, however, received a total of  $800,000 in three cash deliveries, Boesky said.    ""It was assembled by a colleague out of my personal accounts, put into a  briefcase and handed by an intermediary to Mr. Siegel,"" Boesky said.    A fourth cash delivery to Siegel was canceled when he received word about a  Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into Levine's dealings, he  said.    Levine, the first to implicate Boesky, pleaded guilty to felony charges in  June, 1986, and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors. Siegel also pleaded  guilty to securities fraud-related counts and is awaiting sentencing.    Boesky is the government's main witness against Mulheren on charges of stock  manipulation and other securities fraud violations.    The two once were close friends but Mulheren became enraged when he learned  Boesky had implicated him in wrongdoing a few years ago. At one point, Mulheren  allegedly plotted to assassinate him with an assault rifle. Weapons charges  against Mulheren were subsequently dropped.    Boesky, who avoided making eye contact with the defendant, said Mulheren was  one of his few friends with whom he shared the information he received from  Levine and Siegel.

He said  in a statement that Defence Minister Mr Joe Modise had made  representations to him about the need for additional senior  personnel to run his ministry.    He had agreed to the request after taking into account the  important role of the SANDF [South African National Defense  Force] and the challenges it faced in the vital process of  integrating the different armed forces.    Mr Mandela said Mr Kasrils had experience in military  affairs  as a leading officer of Umkhonto we Sizwe.    His experience, expertise and skills enabled him to play an  important role in the defence subcouncil of the Transitional  Executive Council.    ""I am confident that he will do the same in his new role as  deputy minister of defence,"" he said.    Mr Kasrils' appointment brings the total number of deputy  ministers to 13.    He became a member of Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK) on its creation  and carried out acts of sabotage before being sent abroad for  military training.    After several years in the ANC office in Dar es Salaam Mr  Kasrils and his wife Eleanor moved to London where he worked to  establish underground MK units in South Africa. During this  period he also co-wrote several books about the philosopher and  socialist Bertrand Russell.    In 1977 Mr Kasrils moved to Angola to become political  instructor in the MK camps and later political commissar for  Angola.    He was based in Lusaka between 1985 and 1989. He was chief  of  military intelligence from 1983-1988 and was a co-opted member  of the National Executive Committee from 1987.    When he returned illegally to the country at the end of  1989,  Mr Kasrils was hunted by the security forces for his role in  Operation Vula and repeatedly escaped arrest before being  indemnified in June 1991. He was elected to the NEC [National  Executive Committee] and the National Working Committee and the  Political Bureau of the SACP [South African Communist Party].    Kasrils' autobiography ""Armed and Dangerous: My Undercover  Struggle Against Apartheid"" was published earlier this year.     "

Under the pressure of  economic sanctions and international isolation, De Klerk decided it was better  to jaw with Nelson Mandela than to jail him. Greater political participation  and involvement are happening in the country. Hopes for fundamental change have  risen. But only the hope, not the reality.    This week, President Bush became thefirst U.S. President to meet with the head  of a South Africa still organized on the principle of apartheid. If President  Bush had met with De Klerk to repeat forcefully our concern for a democracy,  our commitment to sanctions until democracy is reality, the meeting might have  been understandable. We must learn to talk with those who we oppose. For the  same reason, the United States should try to talk it out with Hussein, not  simply fight it out. But we would not praise Hussein while Americans were still  held hostage and Iraqi troops remained in Kuwait. Why then embrace De Klerk?    Many fear that De Klerk hopes to use cosmetic reform to end South Africa's  costly international isolation, without ending the brutal racial exploitation  on which apartheid is built -- a face lift without changing the fundamentals in  South Africa. The Administration's decision to use a loophole in the sanctions  law to import South African iron and steel may embolden him. President Bush's  warm embrace may encourage him. If so, the President's meeting with De Klerk  was as wrong-headed as the Administration's kinder and gentler dealings with  Saddam Hussein prior to the invasion of Kuwait. Both conversations sent the  wrong message to the wrong man at the wrong time.    When Iraq's aggression threatens the supply of oil, we mobilize the world.

By David M. Kennedy, David M. Kennedy is a professor of history at Stanford  University.      PALO ALTO      Several years ago I escorted a group of American college students to an  interview with the Speaker of the British House of Commons. The Speaker's  schedule dictated that the meeting take place in the ornate dressing room where  he was being enrobed before assuming his place on the dais that dominates the  debating well between the tiered House benches. Arriving a bit late, we saw the  back of a tall figure already mantled in a black gown. Attendants fluttered  about him, draping various accouterments on his lanky frame.    As he turned to greet us, an almost undetectable flicker of surprise ruffled  his dignified composure. Then he surveyed the assemblage of young Americans,  wearing shorts, T-shirts, sandals and baseball caps, being ushered into the  vestment chamber of the Speaker of the Mother of Parliaments, and he proceeded  to deliver a lecture.    The lecture was not about dress standards -- though I've always suspected it  was the students' attire that prompted it. It was about taking things for  granted. More particularly, it was about taking freedom for granted.    ""Men have died for your freedom,"" he said in his booming Welsh baritone. The  students looked as if they had just been slapped with a wet towel. Did real  people talk like that? They had heard that sort of thing only in movies --  mostly black-and-white movies, the boring kind. What odd and sentimental folk  these Brits were!    Americans have had many occasions in recent months to witness this unsettling  foreign tendency to speak with unabashed reverence about things like freedom  and democracy. What's more, foreigners have adopted the discomforting habit of  invoking our national icons and quoting our historic heroes in defense of  liberty. President Vaclav Havel of Czechoslovakia and Prime Minister Tadeusz  Mazowiecki of Poland display easy familiarity with Thomas Jefferson; Lech  Walesa as well as Soviet reformers and Romanian rebels cite Abraham Lincoln;  Nelson Mandela lays a wreath at the tomb of Martin Luther King Jr., and, in the  most dramatic cultural expropriation of all, Chinese students in Tian An Men  Square parade a replica of Lady Liberty -- herself a gift to the United States  from the people of France.    Surely we are all proud that our national symbols, and the values for which  they stand, are honored by other peoples. But many Americans also find the  practice rather quaint, a kind of unsophisticated incantation by simple-minded  foreigners who know our history only superficially and therefore have not yet  acquired our worldly attitudes of iconoclasm and, especially, hero-bashing.    Foreign visitors may gaze on the statuary in the Capitol and see the emblems of  elemental political forces and powerful cultural values; we see some enmarbled  guys -- and a few women -- whose latter-day handlers managed to pull off a neat  media stunt that got them turned into permanent tourist attractions. We know  that all those characters pulled their trousers on one leg at a time, that they  had their full quota of human frailties, that there are no giants on the earth.  Familiarity may not breed contempt, but it surely demystifies. We are too well  acquainted with our historical selves to be awed. Perhaps our self-knowledge  has robbed us of the capacity to be inspired.    And yet, in an arresting inversion of the behavior that finds our own prophets  more honored in other lands, we have recently poured our own adulation  unrestrainedly over two visitors from abroad: Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Mandela.  Gorbachev's visit to Stanford University in June elicited the kind of frenzied  adoration once tendered only by mobs of pubescent women to rock megastars. In a  great university committed to cultivating the domain of reason, all classes  were canceled and throngs of jostling, shouting, waving people surged behind  the police barricades, aching for a glimpse of the Soviet leader.    Smaller but no less passionate crowds greeted Mandela wherever he appeared. No  imaginable American political figure could command such displays of affection  and enthusiasm. Indeed, public figures from Jesse Jackson to George Deukmejian  clamored to get in the same camera-frame with Mandela and Gorbachev, just to  bask in their reflected glory.    Again, Americans are justifiably enthused about Gorbachev's attempt to reshape  Soviet society, and Mandela's struggle to bring racial justice to South Africa.  But why are we so passive and jaded about appeals to modernize our own rickety  social infrastructure, or rutted streets and crowded schools? Why are we  increasingly so cantankerous and confrontational about our own racial problems?  Why so intent on demythologizing all our national heroes, so fiercely resistant  to affording to any living American the claim to be able to inspire us?    Just as we find the world's excitement about our political values to be a kind  of flattering curiosity, so do we seem more willing to cheer political change  at a distance than close at hand, more apt to lionize the visitors, not the  locals.    What's going on here? Partly, one supposes, we cheer Havel and Gorbachev and  Mandela with abandon because we are emotionally invested exclusively in their  success. It won't be for us to suffer the disemployment and inflation and  uncertainty and, quite possibly, the violence that will in all likelihood  attend their various struggles to transform their countries. For us, their  efforts will be gain without pain. At home, in contrast, we sense the real  discomfort that change must entail -- higher taxes; ragged, tiring  argumentation; close, demanding inter-racial dialogue and concessions.    This much history we do know: However attractive democracy might be in the  abstract, it has proved a messy and painful business in practice. And that's  why we need periodically to re-trim the vessel that is carrying us on our  national journey. The sober idealism of Jefferson and Lincoln and King is  weighty ballast for the ship of state, both in stormy seas and in periods, like  the present, of sullen calm. We need their visionary captaincy now as much as  ever. Those struggling to launch democracies know this, and we who should be  trying to stay the course shouldn't forget it. This is one thing that cannot be  taken for granted.    As that black-gowned Welshman said to my students, some things are worth dying  for. We may not be called upon to do the actual dying, but if we don't reckon  democracy that kind of value, democracy itself surely will.

The tour will take Li to Nicaragua, Costa Rica, South Africa  and Swaziland, all of which maintain close official relations  with the Republic of China [ROC].    President Li will sign joint communiques with Nicaraguan,  Costa Rican and Swazi presidents pledging to continue  strengthening bilateral relations, the ministry of foreign  affairs said Monday.    Li is scheduled to arrive in Managua, Nicaragua on  Wednesday,  (local time) for a two-day visit, the ministry said. The  Nicaraguan Government will give Li a 21-gun salute.    Li will deliver a speech to the Nicaraguan Congress on  Thursday, and the congress will confer a medal to Li in  recognition of his contribution to promoting ROC-Nicaraguan  relations. Li will be the fourth recipient of such an honor.    Li will then fly to Costa Rica on Friday for a three-day  visit. While there, he will attend the inauguration of  President-Elect Jose Maria Figueres, which is scheduled to take  place on Sunday. While there, Li will visit an export  processing zone Taiwan's BES Engineering Corp. has built to  attract Taiwan investment to the Central American country.    Li will then proceed to South Africa, where on may 10 he  will  attend the inauguration of the new South African president.  African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela is widely  believed to have won that country's first multiracial  presidential election.    The Foreign Affairs Ministry said it is arranging for  meetings between Li and South African leaders, including Mandela  and incumbent President F.W. de Klerk.    Li will fly to Swaziland May 12 for a state visit. In  addition to meeting with Swazi King Mswati III, he will also  visit a demonstration farm and a handicraft center that the ROC  has helped establish there.    Li and his entourage are scheduled to return to Taipei May  16.    This will be Li's first official overseas tour since he  assumed the presidency in 1988. He made unofficial visits to  Singapore in 1989 and to the Philippines, Indonesia and Thailand  in February this year. All four Southeast Asian countries  recognize Beijing, while maintaining close economic ties with  Taiwan.     "

Talks between the ANC and the AVF have broken  down over the establishment of an Afrikaner volkstaat [Afrikaner  homeland]. Leader of the AVF, General Constand Viljoen:    [Begin recording] [Viljoen] It is a disappointment. There is  some inconsistency in the whole development. We had, on  Saturday morning, rather very positive discussions with the  negotiating team and then all of a sudden, Saturday afternoon  Mr. Mandela took a very strong viewpoint and he repeated it  Sunday evening and to us it is now very clear that Mr. Mandela  has decided completely otherwise [as heard]. As I say this is  rather, you know ... [changes thought] It is not in line with  the discussions and the spirit of the discussions which we had  up to now, so it is a great disappointment, yet the two leaders  met yesterday afternoon and they have sorted it out and it  appeared as if Mr. Mandela has decided that there will be  absolutely no position on a volkstaat -- then I agree with Dr.  Hartzenberg. Then there is no sense in carrying on with the  negotiations at the moment.    [Pienaar] Have you had any feedback from the negotiators on  the ANC's side and from your negotiating team so far?    [Viljoen] Of course, we met here with our own negotiating  team. We have discussed the situation, not with the complete  team but we have consulted with the individual members up to  now. I haven't called them together. The ANC today will  probably meet their negotiating team and we will probably hear  from them in due course -- what their viewpoint is, but from the  negotiating teams there is not much we can do because it was  decided at leadership level there will be no negotiations and I  can see no alternative, because what is the sense of carrying on  with negotiations. Are we just wasting our time? This is the  pity, you know, even Mr. Mandela's present action is  inconsistent with his previous ones, because previously he has  said to us -- don't shout at us, give us a map. Now this is the  time when we were really moving towards what he demanded and  then all of a sudden he called it off just like that. So to us  this is not quite understandable.    [Pienaar] How do you see the road ahead? Is there still a  light at the end of the tunnel? Do you still see the  possibility of an agreement being reached before the deadline?    [Viljoen] This is a very serious situation that we have  arrived at, at the moment, because humanly speaking we have come  to the end of the road of negotiations. Now, what have we  achieved? I think from the Volksfront's point of view what we  can say is we have achieved at least the higher moral ground --  to say that ... [changes thought] or the moral high ground to  say we have done everything that we possibly could. We have  really gone all the way. We have done this with enthusiasm and  we haven't spared a moment. We even worked between Christmas and  New Year to facilitate this so that is what we have achieved.  Now the road ahead of us: I would say we have to decide now  what else to do because there is no doubt about the fact that  the Afrikaner wants a volkstaat and that we are going to have a  volkstaat. I have been very firm on this right from the  beginning and we were prepared to negotiate the details of the  volkstaat, but we were never prepared to negotiate anything but  a volkstaat and this is for a security arrangement -- for a  peace arrangement for the future of South Africa. I think it is  in the interest of the whole country, and what is even more  important is the fact that this is a possible peace settlement  or a complete change of attitude between two major forces of  South Africa -- the Afrikaners and the Africans, as represented  by the ANC. It is rather a disappointment because we both ...  [changes thought] both negotiating teams always acknowledged  this fact of how important this is. [end recording]     "

But this people did not capitulate or recognize  under torture that the land of blacks belonged to whites paying  for that with blood and tears which resulted at the end in the  declaration of freedom and independence of the people of South  Africa.

The struggle and victory of our people in south of  black Africa draws the historic way for the struggle and  expected victory for our people in usurped Palestine. Nothing  muddled the clear skies of South Africa lit with candles of the  bodies of the victims of racism and lamps run with the blood  spilled for freedom and cleaned with the tears of millions who  were tortured for the sake of their right to live in their  homeland except the presence of the racist terrorist Zionist  delegation which befouled purified South Africa. It seems that  the Zionists were so guilt ridden that they allowed themselves  to attend the delight of people during their celebration of  victory over international racism. Did the Zionist forget their  unholy alliance with the Pretoria regime and their support for  it against you ""and the exchange of expertise in torture and  racism?"". Weren't the Israelis the natural ally of the racist  regime of South Africa. Didn't the Israelis take part with  whites in tens of years of genocide and torture against blacks.

The Bombay Stock Exchange 30-share index rose 11 per cent, adding 344.76 to 3,431.13, wiping out Tuesday's sharp decline. The two-week tumble in share prices had been triggered by revelations of a financial scandal that resulted in the syphoning of funds from the government securities market into equity purchases. The massive intervention by the financial institutions came after the stock exchange authorities overnight banned forward selling in 85 shares. In an effort to curb abuses in the interbank securities market the Reserve Bank, the country's central bank, yesterday issued fresh guidelines to commercial banks operating in the market. The central bank said banks should not hold an oversold position in a security - meaning that a bank should not sell a security which it did not actually hold. Finance Ministry officials say that some of the abuses in the securities market involve 'fraud and potential criminality.' The Reserve Bank is also probing securities dealing by ANZ Grindlays, Standard Chartered, Bank of America and Citibank, as well as 15 Indian state-owned banks. ANZ Grindlays, India's largest foreign bank and the one believed to be most exposed to losses from abuses in the securities market, last night declined to comment further on its involvement. It issued a press release which said that the bank sees 'no useful purpose in adding to speculation in the market'. According to widespread market reports, National Housing Bank issued a cheque to Grindlays for a large sum which was then credited to the account of Mr Harshad Mehta. Mr Mehta is the Bombay broker who was forced to repay Rs6.2bn (Pounds 122m) to State Bank of India to settle outstanding accounts in the interbank market in government securities. In its new guidelines the Reserve Bank also banned the use of brokers' accounts in interbank dealings. In the present financial scandal the worst abuses occurred as a result of connivance between brokers and bankers in what are normally direct transactions between banks.

Public Citizen's Congress Watch, an organization founded by activist Ralph  Nader, estimated that the government's civil and criminal actions have  recovered only $300 million, while fraud at the more than 440 S&Ls seized  since early last year amounted to $16.3 billion.    ""The Bush Administration's efforts to pursue and punish S&L fraud have been  anemic at best, irresponsible at worst,"" said Sherry Ettleson, an attorney who  prepared a 23-page report on the issue for the group.    The report, issued at a news conference, comes amid growing Democratic  criticism of the Administration's prosecution of S&L fraud. Partisan furor  on the issue has blossomed since the Administration last month said Congress  would have to provide an additional $30 billion to $50 billion for a second  bailout.    In an apparent attempt to blunt the criticism, President Bush is scheduled  Friday to address the nation's 93 U.S. attorneys. Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh  summoned the top federal prosecutors to the meeting at the Justice Department,  said spokesman Dan Eramian.    The Nader organization faulted the Administration for spending only an  additional $50 million on pursuing thrift crime, when Congress had authorized  spending of up to $75 million. The Administration has responded that Congress  eventually appropriated only $50 million and officials are spending that  amount.    It said the Justice Department is pursuing 891 cases actively, compared to a  backlog of 6,993 cases. Yet the department has added fewer than half the 425  additional agents requested by the FBI and only 118 of the 231 assistant U.S.  attorneys requested by the department's field offices, the report said.    ""Based on the record thus far, there is little evidence that the Bush  Administration is committed to catching and punishing white-collar criminals  who largely caused the worst financial scandal in U.S. history,"" Ettleson  wrote.    The group recommended that the Administration spend more on pursuing fraud,  turn its attention to accountants and lawyers who aided S&L executives in  committing fraud, and drop its support of proposed legislation that would  remove the threat of triple damages from civil racketeering suits.    It said Congress should enact legislation that would permit whistle blowers to  bring suit against alleged S&L criminals on behalf of the government and  share in the damages if fraud is found to have occurred.

Women, farmers and shopkeepers defected to the Socialist Party in record  numbers in a tax and scandal revolt, handing the ruling party its first defeat  in a national election since it was formed in 1955.    NHK, the semi-governmental radio and TV network, reported that Uno was planning  to give an unscheduled press conference to announce his intention to resign to  accept responsibility for the defeat.    Uno reportedly informed both his chief Cabinet secretary, Masajuro Shiokawa,  and ruling party officials of his intention to step down.      13 Seats Shy of Majority    From a 17-seat majority in the last election three years ago, the conservatives  plummeted to at least 13 seats shy of a majority in the 252-member House of  Councillors, or upper house, of Parliament.    Socialists, meanwhile, increased their holdings by at least 18 seats in the  upper house, where all bills except the budget and treaties must be approved.  Half the seats were at stake.    With 21 of the 126 races yet to be determined, Socialists had outstripped the  Liberal Democrats 40 to 31.    The results were so overwhelming that only three hours after 65% of Japan's  90.3 million voters finished casting ballots, NHK declared the conservatives  defeated.    In losing its stranglehold on legislation, the ruling party will be forced to  seek a coalition with middle-of-the-road opposition parties or to negotiate  every bill with the opposition parties.    Three ruling party leaders immediately called for Uno's resignation -- also  without waiting for the final vote tally.    Declaring that the outcome had created ""the greatest party crisis since its  founding,"" former Prime Minister Zenko Suzuki demanded that responsibility for  the debacle be ""made clear."" Toshio Komoto, a former deputy prime minister,  also called for an accounting of ""responsibility.""    Party elder Raizo Matsuno was more direct. ""It will be impossible for a prime  minister defeated in an election to continue to carry out politics,"" he said.    Major factional leaders, however, refused to comment or offered vague support  for Uno to stay in office until the term he inherited from Prime Minister  Noboru Takeshita ends Oct. 30.    Opposition leaders immediately called for Uno's resignation and an early  dissolution of the lower house.    Including incumbents not up for reelection, the Liberal Democrats had nailed  down 104 seats, compared to 60 for the Socialists. All opposition forces,  however, had already secured 127 seats -- exactly equal to a simple majority.    No more than 10 additional Liberal Democrats still held hopes of winning seats.    A new pan-opposition alliance organized by the labor federation Rengo (Japan  Private Sector Trade Union Confederation) elected 11 of its 12 candidates. The  new group, analysts said, could form the core of an opposition-led coalition  should the Liberal Democrats lose their majority in a future election for the  lower house, which elects the prime minister.    The result ensured that the ruling party will remain in disarray, with no  effective leadership for an unpredictable period.    Pointing to a 5% real growth expected in this year's gross national product,  however, business leaders expressed confidence that the economy would suffer no  immediate setback.    The Tokyo Foreign Exchange Market, however, opened today with the yen declining  to 143.25 yen to the dollar, 1.10 points below Friday's close.    Some analysts predicted that voters would adopt a more conservative attitude in  any lower house election, where leadership of the government will be at stake.    One TV survey of voters leaving the polls Sunday found that two-thirds of those  who cast ballots for opposition candidates were voting against the Liberal  Democrats, rather than in favor of the opposition.      Distrust Among Voters Cited    ""We were done in,"" Ryutaro Hashimoto, the Liberal Democrats' secretary general,  conceded. Hashimoto refused to single out any one issue as the cause of the  landslide defeat. But underlying the debacle, he said, was ""the voters'  distrust in politics.""    The distrust, pollsters said, stemmed from broken promises to both consumers  and farmers as well as the voters' repulsion to a widespread influence-buying  scandal that tainted all of the ruling party's major factional leaders. That  scandal forced the resignation of Takeshita, but his handpicked successor, Uno,  become embroiled in a new scandal over money-for-sex charges two days after he  took office June 2.    In the 1986 election, the Liberal Democrats promised to keep Japan's  agricultural markets closed to imports and told consumers and shopkeepers that  they would not implement any large-scale indirect tax. But the party last year  bowed to American demands and agreed to lift quotas on beef and citrus fruit  imports by April 1, 1991, and then unilaterally rammed a 3% consumption tax  through Parliament last December. It was implemented April 1.    The farm revolt helped the opposition, as it won all five of the rice-rich  prefectures (states) in Tohoku (northeast Japan) and all four prefectures on  the island of Shikoku, a major mandarin orange-growing region. Three  prefectures on the island of Kyushu, where cattle farmers are prominent, went  to the Socialists.

""Voters realized that if Liberal Democrat politics continued (without protest),  their lives would be affected,"" said Takako Doi, chairwoman of the Socialist  Party, who made her opposition to the consumption tax the centerpiece of her  campaign.    Doi said the party would submit a bill to abolish the tax and said her party  would fight farm imports, as it promised during the 18-day campaign.    Liberal Democratic candidates lost their seats in the only two districts in  which Uno campaigned, including Shiga, Uno's home prefecture and a traditional  conservative stronghold.

No Split This Time    Victories by Rengo candidates, who were backed by four opposition parties, in  all 10 of the one-seat districts in which they ran marked a major departure  from past elections.

Three years ago, the conservatives won 23 of  the 26 one-seat districts but this time secured only three of them.    For the first time, the unionists put up candidates who were not professional  union leaders but rather lawyers, professors, journalists and women with no  previous experience in politics.    A repetition of that tactic in a lower house election could spell major trouble  for the Liberal Democrats.    Like the established opposition parties, however, Rengo has failed to reach  agreement on major policies that would be necessary to form an opposition-led  coalition should the Liberal Democrats lose their majority in a lower house  election.    "," LA072489-0024   86064    July 24, 1989, Monday, Southland Edition      Part 1; Page 1; Column 5; Foreign Desk      1231 words      UNO MAY RESIGN AFTER PARTY DEFEAT;    JAPAN'S LEADER REPORTED READY TO ASSUME BLAME FOR 1ST NATIONAL LOSS      By SAM JAMESON, Times Staff Writer      TOKYO      Japanese Prime Minister Sosuke Uno was reported preparing to announce his  resignation today after the ruling Liberal Democratic Party suffered a  humiliating defeat Sunday in an election for the upper house of Parliament.    Women, farmers and shopkeepers defected to the Socialist Party in record  numbers in a tax and scandal revolt, handing the ruling party its first defeat  in a national election since it was formed in 1955.    NHK, the semi-governmental radio and TV network, reported that Uno was planning  to give an unscheduled press conference to announce his intention to resign to  accept responsibility for the defeat.    Uno reportedly informed both his chief Cabinet secretary, Masajuro Shiokawa,  and ruling party officials of his intention to step down.      13 Seats Shy of Majority    From a 17-seat majority in the last election three years ago, the conservatives  plummeted to at least 13 seats shy of a majority in the 252-member House of  Councillors, or upper house, of Parliament.    Socialists, meanwhile, increased their holdings by at least 18 seats in the  upper house, where all bills except the budget and treaties must be approved.  Half the seats were at stake.    With 21 of the 126 races yet to be determined, Socialists had outstripped the  Liberal Democrats 40 to 31.    The results were so overwhelming that only three hours after 65% of Japan's  90.3 million voters finished casting ballots, NHK declared the conservatives  defeated.    In losing its stranglehold on legislation, the ruling party will be forced to  seek a coalition with middle-of-the-road opposition parties or to negotiate  every bill with the opposition parties.    Three ruling party leaders immediately called for Uno's resignation -- also  without waiting for the final vote tally.    Declaring that the outcome had created ""the greatest party crisis since its  founding,"" former Prime Minister Zenko Suzuki demanded that responsibility for  the debacle be ""made clear."" Toshio Komoto, a former deputy prime minister,  also called for an accounting of ""responsibility.""    Party elder Raizo Matsuno was more direct. ""It will be impossible for a prime  minister defeated in an election to continue to carry out politics,"" he said.    Major factional leaders, however, refused to comment or offered vague support  for Uno to stay in office until the term he inherited from Prime Minister  Noboru Takeshita ends Oct. 30.    Opposition leaders immediately called for Uno's resignation and an early  dissolution of the lower house.    Including incumbents not up for reelection, the Liberal Democrats had nailed  down 104 seats, compared to 60 for the Socialists. All opposition forces,  however, had already secured 127 seats -- exactly equal to a simple majority.    No more than 10 additional Liberal Democrats still held hopes of winning seats.    A new pan-opposition alliance organized by the labor federation Rengo (Japan  Private Sector Trade Union Confederation) elected 11 of its 12 candidates. The  new group, analysts said, could form the core of an opposition-led coalition  should the Liberal Democrats lose their majority in a future election for the  lower house, which elects the prime minister.    The result ensured that the ruling party will remain in disarray, with no  effective leadership for an unpredictable period.    Pointing to a 5% real growth expected in this year's gross national product,  however, business leaders expressed confidence that the economy would suffer no  immediate setback.    The Tokyo Foreign Exchange Market, however, opened today with the yen declining  to 143.25 yen to the dollar, 1.10 points below Friday's close.    Some analysts predicted that voters would adopt a more conservative attitude in  any lower house election, where leadership of the government will be at stake.    One TV survey of voters leaving the polls Sunday found that two-thirds of those  who cast ballots for opposition candidates were voting against the Liberal  Democrats, rather than in favor of the opposition.      Distrust Among Voters Cited    ""We were done in,"" Ryutaro Hashimoto, the Liberal Democrats' secretary general,  conceded. Hashimoto refused to single out any one issue as the cause of the  landslide defeat. But underlying the debacle, he said, was ""the voters'  distrust in politics.""    The distrust, pollsters said, stemmed from broken promises to both consumers  and farmers as well as the voters' repulsion to a widespread influence-buying  scandal that tainted all of the ruling party's major factional leaders. That  scandal forced the resignation of Takeshita, but his handpicked successor, Uno,  become embroiled in a new scandal over money-for-sex charges two days after he  took office June 2.

As the vicious infighting over the leadership of the Takeshita faction continued unabated yesterday, Mr Koichi Kato, chief cabinet secretary, said the 18-point plan would not propose overhauling the electoral system. It is likely to include measures to confiscate illegal political contributions. Many analysts believe the costs of the electoral system, based on large multi-member constituencies, is largely responsible for the prevalence of political corruption. Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, prime minister, will outline the reforms to parliament which reconvenes on Friday in response to the controversy over the Sagawa Kyubin political contributions scandal. The scandal prompted the power struggle in the Takeshita faction, which has played a vital role in managing the passage of legislation through parliament, after Mr Shin Kanemaru, its former chief was forced to resign. Mr Kanemaru who wielded immense power within the LDP admitted receiving Y500m (Pounds 2.5m) in illegal political contributions from Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin trucking company. The Miyazawa cabinet's popularity has slumped largely because of the scandal and the ailing economy. The vacuum created by Mr Kanemaru's departure has set off a struggle between supporters of his chosen successor, Mr Ichiro Ozawa, and an anti-Ozawa group. Mr Ozawa and his backers are contesting the nomination last week of Mr Keizo Obuchi as faction chief. Parliament is likely to become the focus of the scandal, as Mr Noboru Takeshita, the faction's founder, has promised to testify about his role in the affair. Japan's political leadership would be further destabilised if pressure mounted on him to resign. Government officials are increasingly concerned that the infighting could spill over to delay passage of legislation to enact the Y10,700bn emergency public spending programme announced in August. The economic programme could become embroiled in the power struggle partly because Mr Tsutomu Hata, finance minister, has aligned himself with the Ozawa group. About 86 per cent of parliamentary deputies are believed to want the electoral system overhauled.  The Financial Times   London Page 4  "

Speaking on the first day of a two-day visit to South Africa, Mr Mitterrand paid tribute to South Africans for their successful democratic elections and said he hoped the occasion would mark the building of closer ties between the two countries. He is the first foreign head of state to address parliament since the then Mr Harold Macmillan, British prime minister of the time, delivered his famous 'winds of change' speech in 1961. Although some critics have suggested that Mr Mitterrand's visit is merely an attempt to boost his international image, the speech is seen as an attempt by France, which has long maintained involvement in its former colonies in West and central Africa, to stake out its position as the pre-eminent western power in Africa. It hopes to secure South Africa's support for its involvement in Rwanda and on economic development policies in Africa. On South Africa's side the visit represents an opportunity to build up support from an important member of the European Union, particularly in light of current trade talks between the EU and South Africa. In addition, both countries will be seeking to expand bilateral trade and investment links. Mr Mitterrand called on French industrialists, several of whom are accompanying him on his visit, to 'do the right thing' and invest, but announced no specific aid or investment package. However, he said that he expected conventions to be signed during his visit in the electrification, water and rural development sectors. In addition, several French companies are expected to announce partnership deals with local black businesses over the next few days, and an agreement on some aid from the French Development Bank is also expected to be concluded before Mr Mitterrand leaves tomorrow night. Introducing him to parliament, South Africa's President Nelson Mandela paid tribute to his French counterpart for his anti-apartheid support and cited the French revolution as inspiration for the South African struggle. In a ceremony earlier, Mr Mandela awarded Mr Mitterrand its highest award for non-South African citizens for his services to South Africa.   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.

The lawsuit alleges Mr Mozer violated the anti-fraud and record-keeping provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 when he submitted eight false bids worth Dollars 13.5bn in seven separate auctions of US Treasury securities between August 1989 and May 1991. Mr Murphy, who was the senior trader on the bond desk at the time, is accused of having been involved in three false bids. Last night, Mr Murphy denied that he had violated securities laws and said he would contest the charges vigorously, and Mr Mozer denied all the allegations except that in February 1991 two unauthorised bids were submitted in one of the auctions. Yesterday's suit represents the first legal action the government has brought against individuals involved in the Salomon scandal of August 1991, when bond traders at the Wall Street securities house were found to have faked customer bids for Treasury bills in an attempt to buy more newly issued securities than was allowed by government rules. Salomon itself settled all charges related to the scandal in May of this year, when it paid Dollars 290m in fines and compensation to the government. Mr Mozer is also charged in the civil suit with insider trading involving the sale of 46,000 Salomon shares, and with arranging false trades to create an artificial tax loss for Salomon. The fixing of false trades was allegedly conducted in 1986 with the help of individuals at other, unnamed, firms, and allowed Salomon to claim the bulk of about Dollars 168m in trading losses against taxes. The insider trading charge relates to Mr Mozer's sale of 46,000 shares of Salomon on August 6 1991. The SEC says Mr Mozer sold the shares knowing that information about the false Treasury bids would soon be released. A few days later details of the activities were released and Salomon's share prices fell sharply.  The Financial Times   London Page 27  "

Speaking at an ANC fundraising  dinner in East London, he also said neither he nor ANC President  Nelson Mandela had accepted an Afrikaner volkstaat [homeland].    He said the ANC had been looking forward to the meeting  which  was to have been held with the Zulu king this week but was  cancelled. ""As of now we have never received any proposal from  the Zulu king as to what he wants so we don't know what he wants  apart from what was reported in the newspapers. We would like  to engage the king to hear what he wants and to see in what  manner whatever concerns he expresses can be addressed.""    Clearly, in legal, political and constitutional terms, and  in  ordinary reality there was no such thing as an independent  kwaZulu/Natal.

""Any matter that has to do with dismemberment of  South Africa in any way is a matter that would have to be  decided by the people of South Africa as a whole.""    He said the ANC had not agreed to a volkstaat. What it had  agreed was to continue discussions with what was now called the  Freedom Front on the idea of a volkstaat. ""To continue the  discussions and possibly conclude them before the elections,  we've agreed to that.""    A document agreed to by the ANC and the Afrikaner Volksfront  [Afrikaner National Union] in September last year stipulated  that any solution to the volkstaat question would have to be  consistent with the principles of democracy and non-racialism.  The two sides had agreed that any further discussion on the  issue should be guided by these principles. ""So the proponents  of a volkstaat have an obligation to make proposals about a  (territory) that would be democratic, non-racial,  anti-apartheid, resulting in peace, absence of conflict and so  on. If a volkstaat consistent with these principles can be  proposed, I don't think the ANC will have a problem with it.""  However no such proposal had been made.

The increased costs will put a severe strain on the country's financial resources and could increase inflation, reversing the recent trend toward lower price rises. Inflation fell sharply under the previous government, to below 10 per cent annually. However, the political pressure on the ANC to implement the programme, in which it promises to address a wide range of social and development issues, will be strong. The plan was the centrepiece of the party's election platform and President Nelson Mandela has committed himself publicly to full implementation. Mr Jay Naidoo, minister-without-portfolio charged with implementing the programme, admitted that the cost would be higher than expected but said he was confident it could be funded without compromising fiscal discipline. The bulk would be financed by restructuring and rationalising present government spending. The revised figures are drawn from the National Institute for Economic policy, an ANC think tank. Mr Max Sisulu, head of the institute, said that the revised estimates of R80bn-R90bn included spending by both central government and government bodies such as the electricity supplier Eskom. The anticipated costs still remain well below the R700bn figure given in a pre-election study commissioned by the outgoing National Party. Mr Sisulu said that the research, the full results of which are due to be released in the next few days, was based on the assumption that there would be no foreign grants and no marked tax changes over the first two years. The increased costs are unlikely to be reflected in this year's budget, expected to be presented to parliament on June 22. That is not expected to differ significantly from last year's as the previous government had already begun to address many of the reconstruction programme's social spending commitments in previous budgets. Mr Naidoo said the full effect would not be felt until the 1995-96 fiscal year. The Johannesburg Stock Exchange reacted negatively to the new cost estimates, with the overall index falling 70 points to end at 5387.

Mr Nelson Mandela, glowing with the energy that comes from victory, led the joyous high-stepping celebration of black South Africa's emancipation from apartheid. It began in the ballroom of a Johannesburg city hotel bedecked with bunting and balloons in the black, green and gold of the African National Congress. By mid-evening it had spread through the exuberant black townships. 'Free at last, free at last, thank God free at last,' declared South Africa's next president, in the immortal words of Martin Luther King. The famous phrase rang across South Africa and around the world as the 75-year-old Mr Mandela reached the final, triumphal summit of a journey that began when he was a young advocate, and has taken him via Robben Island's cells to leadership of his country. Mr Mandela's declaration of victory included graceful acceptance of departing President F. W. de Klerk's declaration of defeat but had a steely undertone of single-minded dedication to his goal. 'I stand before you humbled by your courage, with a heart full of love for all of you,' he said. 'Tomorrow the entire ANC leadership and I will be back at our desks, rolling up our sleeves to begin tackling the problems our country faces . . . let's get South Africa working. This means creating jobs, building houses, providing education and bringing peace and security for all.' Behind Mr Mandela the ranks of the ANC choir broke into song, the packed audience joined in and the dancing began. Mr Mandela's elbows sawed the air. The former boxer, moving like a cross between Mohammed Ali and Michael Jackson, led the dancing of a night to remember. From the stage came the resonant baritone of ex-president Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia, whose country paid such a high price for its role as ANC headquarters and who was an honoured guest. On the dance floor the audience contained almost as many whites, coloureds and Indians as blacks. Groups in the hall began the toyi-toyi, the universal dance of black South Africa - knees raised high, a sort of dancing on the spot, once performed at the barricades of Soweto and black townships around the land but last night an exuberant celebration of the new South Africa.

HE PLANS TO RETURN AFTER SIX WEEKS.      By VICTOR MERINA, TIMES STAFF WRITER      Sheriff Sherman Block, whose department weathered a tumultuous year marred by a  corruption scandal and brutality complaints, disclosed Wednesday that he has  cancer of the prostate gland and will undergo surgery next month.    The 66-year-old Block, who was reelected last spring as head of the nation's  largest sheriff's department, told a news conference that he expects to recover  fully from a malady that doctors have diagnosed as adenocarcinoma, or a  gland-related cancer in his prostate.    ""I am in exceptionally good health otherwise, and after a recuperation period  of about six weeks, I expect to be fully recovered and back to full duty with  the department,"" said Block.    Prostate cancer affects about one in 11 U.S. men, according to health  statistics. Block said his illness was first diagnosed about six weeks ago  during a routine physical examination that spurred further tests.    Since then, the sheriff said he has been undergoing hormonal therapy in  anticipation of surgery now scheduled for Jan. 7 at the Norris Cancer Hospital  & Research Institute in the Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center. During  his recovery period, Block said, he will turn over day-to-day supervision of  his department to Undersheriff Robert A. Edmonds.    ""But I can assure you that after the first few days of recovery, I will be  requesting and receiving regular briefings as to what is occurring in the  department operations,"" Block said.    The surprise medical announcement was sent by Teletype to the department's  12,000 employees at sheriff's stations and other department offices. Edmonds,  52, the department's second-highest official, said that only a few family  members and Block aides were aware of the sheriff's diagnosis.    ""He's well-prepared to undergo the surgery,"" said Edmonds, who was summoned  from vacation to attend the news conference. ""He has a very good attitude about  it and his overall health is very good.""    For the Sheriff's Department, Block's medical condition came as the latest blow  in a downbeat year -- a year the sheriff himself described Wednesday as a  ""mixed bag of pluses and minuses.""    The most traumatic event was the money-skimming scandal, which arose from  allegations that officers pocketed money seized during narcotics operations.  The scandal forced Block to dismantle the department's vaunted narcotics teams,  which had been responsible for some of the county's largest seizures of cocaine  and illegally obtained cash.    In the wake of a federal and local corruption investigation, six sheriff's  narcotics officers were convicted recently of conspiracy and theft. A seventh  officer also was convicted on a related money-laundering charge.    Two more trials are scheduled, and Block said the narcotics scandal may result  in additional indictments against deputies.    In retrospect, the sheriff acknowledged that the narcotics investigation  revealed ""a breakdown of supervision"" in some cases. But he staunchly defended  his administration in the scandal, blaming ""a handful"" of problem officers for  the corruption.    Meanwhile, Block also defended his agency against criticism on other issues  that surfaced in 1990, including accusations that his officers engaged in  excessive force and unwarranted shootings and that a clique of deputies at the  Lynwood sheriff's station adopted street gang behavior to intimidate their  supervisors and citizens.    Block, who has already said he is investigating the Lynwood complaints,  disputed many of the allegations and dismissed other complaints as  unsubstantiated accusations that arise from lawsuits targeting law enforcement  officers.    Although the number of deputy-involved shootings has increased -- from 37 in  1989 to 46 through November of this year -- Block blamed the rise on an overall  increase in street violence in the county.    Homicides handled by his department have soared by 32% this year compared to  1989, and felony assaults have jumped 18%, the sheriff said. In addition, six  deputies have been wounded in street violence, compared to four last year, he  said.      BACKGROUND    Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in men, after skin cancer. One  out of every 11 men will develop it, most of them after age 65. About 30,000  men die from the disease each year, making it the second leading cause of  cancer deaths in men, after lung cancer. However, prostate cancer is often  curable when caught early. Many cases are detected during rectal examinations,  which are recommended annually for all men older than 40. The disease is  treated surgically. Radiation, hormone treatment and chemotherapy may be  prescribed as well. If the cancer has spread beyond the gland, cure is less  certain. But patients whose tumors are still confined to the prostate have a  five-year survival rate of 84%, according to the National Cancer Institute.  About 60% of prostate cancers are diagnosed at this relatively early stage.

Some parties expressed concern  over the implementation of the Reconstruction and Development  Plan and the amnesty issue. But politicians across the  political spectrum said it would boost investor confidence.    [Correctional Services spokesman Sipho Mzimela] I think it  was a very comprehensive speech. It dealt with all the major  areas which government has to attend to and it touched on the  major issues and problems which are facing the county. So in  that sense I think it's a very good speech.    [Freedom Front leader Constand Viljoen in Afrikaans] I think  the reconstruction program which President Mandela talks about  is a very ambitious plan. He is talking about big amounts of  money. I hope it will be possible. For it to become possible  will entirely depend on a, Foreign aid, and b, to what extent  our economy is going to produce. There is quite a strong  feeling among many people that the economy can pick up strongly.  I hope that will be the case because if the economy is not  strong, then we will not be in a position to get this  reconstruction program off the ground.    [Minister Without portfolio Jay Naidoo] I believe it's a  very  realistic program. It offers us a kick start to the  Reconstruction Development Program and we are wanting to deliver  the goods now. And that is what the president has instructed us  to do, and that is what we are going to do.    [Democratic Party acting leader Tony Leon] The Democratic  Party is very encouraged by the tone and by the content of the  speech. We think President Mandela went a long way toward  reassuring all the communities which need to be brought into  nation-building and reconciliation, particularly the financial  and investment community.    [Pan Africanist Congress leader Clarence Makwetu] Well, it  is  not easy for me to comment on the speech as it is, but it was a  well balanced one because it covered quite a number of issues  affecting our country -- the issues like health, gender issues,  education, unemployment, housing etcetera. And these are the  issues we need to address.    [Environmental Affairs, Tourism Minister Dawie de Villiers]  I  think it is a speech that will encourage confidence. The  president succeeded in marrying the objectives of the  Reconstruction and Development Program with sound economic and  financial management. I believe the speech will be well  received by the private sector. [end recording]     "

The issue concerning the return of former  members of military units is developing into a local and  international embarrassment for Namibia after the Committee on  Defense and Security of the Frontline States advised in Windhoek  in April that the soldiers should be allowed to return to their  country of birth. Namibia was also present at the conference and  not only made proposals concerning the return of Namibians from  South Africa, but also suggested that former soldiers who left  Zimbabwe after independence should be allowed to return to their  country. In the latest initiative concerning the fate of  approximately 12,000 Namibians in South Africa, the king of the  Hereros, Mr. Kuaima Riruako, addressed the issue in a letter to  President Sam Nujoma and also sent a copy of the letter to Mr.  Mandela. Mr. Riruako emphasized that the soldiers and their  families -- mainly former members of Koevoet [crowbar; former  police counterinsurgency unit] and the territorial forces --  left the country at that stage because they could not depend on  the protection of the government.    ""The Namibian Government's hesitation, even refusal, to  allow  these Namibians to return to the country of their birth is a  flagrant violation of their constitutional rights. These former  soldiers are Namibians by birth or are descendants of Namibians  and include more than a hundred Hereros and their families.  Since these people fled from Namibia it can be deduced that at  that stage they could not hope for any protection from  government. What makes things worse is that the constitution  determines that no person, as a citizen through birth or those  of Namibian descent, may be denied citizenship. This clearly  indicates that Namibians can come and go as they please. In  light of this constitutional right, the Herero king is calling  on President Sam Nujoma to honor his oath, that is, to protect  the constitution at all times. Mr. Nujoma should also respect  the rights of Namibians who want to return to their country and  he should ensure that they be allowed to return home without any  further delay,"" according to Mr. Riruako's letter to the two  heads of state.

By DON A. SCHANCHE, TIMES STAFF WRITER      ST. JOHNS, Antigua      A festering scandal over illicit arms sent from Israel to Antigua last year and  then mysteriously transshipped to the Colombian drug cartel has embarrassed  Washington and Jerusalem and may bring down the corruption-ridden, family-ruled  government of this Caribbean microstate.    In the still-shadowy transaction, an illegal shipment of 100 Uzi submachine  guns, 400 Galil assault rifles and 250,000 rounds of ammunition, ostensibly  ordered for Antigua's 70-man Defense Force, went instead to Gonzalo Rodriguez  Gacha, one of the top three barons of the Medellin drug cartel. Rodriguez Gacha  was shot and killed last December by Colombian police.    A purchase order purporting to legitimize the shipment and guarantee Antigua as  its final destination bore the name of the elder son of Prime Minister Vere C.  Bird, 81-year-old patriarch of the scandal-prone clan that has dominated this  two-island Caribbean nation, formally called Antigua and Barbuda, since 1951.    Although there is no such post in Antigua, the document identified the son,  Vere Bird Jr., as ""minister of national security."" Despite the irregularity of  the guarantee, the fictitious title and the disproportionate quantity of arms  for such a small security force, Israel apparently accepted the suspect  document in place of the customary ""end user certificate"" routinely required in  government-to-government arms deals, officials here said.    ""There's no way in the world that letter would be accepted by a government in a  legitimate deal,"" one official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.    The officials said Israeli complicity was also suggested by the presence of an  Israeli army officer who escorted the arms to Antigua but raised no objection  when, in an evidently prearranged switch, the arms were transferred with the  help of Antiguan customs officials to a Colombia-bound ship only hours after  they arrived on April 24, 1989.    A controversial Israeli entrepreneur, Maurice Sarfati -- sought by authorities  in both Antigua and the United States after defaulting on U.S.-guaranteed loans  of $1.3 million on a melon farm here -- and ex-Lt. Col. Yair G. Klein, a former  anti-terrorist officer of the Israeli army who has been charged in Jerusalem  with illegally providing military equipment and training to Colombians, are  other key figures in the scandal.    The gunshot-riddled body of a third Israeli, Arik Afek, a known Klein  associate, was found stuffed in the trunk of a car at Miami International  Airport last Jan. 24, and the Miami police are trying to determine whether he,  too, was involved.    When news of the arms scandal broke last April, following a formal diplomatic  protest by Colombia, attention focused on Vere Jr., 53, as the key Antiguan  official involved in engineering the scheme. His brother, Deputy Prime Minister  Lester Bird, 52, was first to point a finger, not only implicating Vere Jr. but  also hiring Washington lawyer Lawrence Barcella -- a former assistant U.S.  attorney for the District of Columbia famed for tracking down rogue CIA agent  Edwin Wilson in Libya in the early 1980s -- to investigate.    Lester Bird's hostility toward Vere Jr. is of long standing. In a struggle that  has often assumed the qualities of a melodramatic soap opera, the millionaire  brothers, both London-trained lawyers, have been vying ""like Cain and Abel,"" as  Vere Jr. once put it, to succeed their faltering octogenarian father, now  serving his sixth five-year term as prime minister.    The elder Bird has remained largely out of the fray and out of public sight,  shielded in recent years by his protective 27-year-old mistress, Cutie Francis,  a powerful local businesswoman who has been at his side since she was a  14-year-old beauty queen.    But protests concerning the arms scandal forced ""Papa"" Bird, as he is known  here, to go public last month and order an official commission of inquiry, run  by an impartial London jurist. The commission is scheduled to open hearings  here today.    No matter how the inquiry turns out, all three Birds may already have suffered  fatal political damage from the arms scandal, according to opposition  politicians and some of their allies in the Antigua Labor Party.    ""This could mean the end of the Bird dynasty,"" said Baldwin Spencer, opposition  leader in the 17-member Parliament.    John St. Luce, minister of finance and longtime Papa Bird supporter, said:  ""People think the era of the Birds is over. It's not a monarchy, not a  dynasty.""    Unless investigators turn up an innocent explanation of Israel's role in the  incident, Jerusalem, too, stands to suffer from the scandal.    Although Israel may not have known that the guns were destined for the drug  cartel, ""they had to know the deal was fishy, that this wasn't a legitimate  arms deal between governments,"" said an official who has closely followed the  investigation.    He said that ever since part of the arms shipment was discovered on the late  drug lord's Colombian ranch last Feb. 2, Israel has been ""dragging its heels""  and offering only token cooperation to Antiguan investigators trying to unravel  the scandal.    ""Is this just the tip of the iceberg?"" asked the official who spoke on  condition of anonymity. ""Were there other shipments? What else are they trying  to cover up?""    He said that Washington, too, should be embarrassed and added: ""The U.S.  government has shown a clear lack of interest in clarifying this scandal. We  have a good, clear trail here that can actually be followed and perhaps open  other trails to the narco-traffickers, yet it's not being pursued. Why?""    A Washington congressional source familiar with details of the scandal said he  believes the Bush Administration has so far stood aloof because it does not  want to make diplomatic trouble for Israel or get entangled in an explosive  internal quarrel here that might endanger agreements that permit highly  secretive U.S. Navy and Air Force bases to operate without restriction.    If Klein, the former Israeli army officer, can be believed, Washington may be  covering up its own role in the affair. Klein's link to the drug lords was  disclosed last year when a U.S. television network showed him supervising the  arms training of men Colombian authorities identified as drug cartel assassins.  He said a few weeks ago, in an unsworn statement, that it all began with plans  to build a ""survival school"" on the island.    Earlier, Klein told the Miami Herald that the deal grew out of a 1988 attempt  to establish a base on Antigua where pro-U.S. rebel forces could be trained to  topple former Panama strongman Manuel A. Noriega. He said he had no contact  with U.S. officials in planning the never-activated training base but that the  anti-Noriega Panamanians involved in the deal might have had.    The State Department says it has expressed ""concern about these arms"" to  Israel. Richard Boucher, a department spokesman, said in early May: ""We are  clearly concerned when government-licensed weapons end up in the hands of  narcotics trafficking organizations. We urge governments involved to  aggressively investigate the incident and take appropriate judicial action.""    Antiguan officials doubt that their commission of inquiry will get enough  cooperation from either Jerusalem or Washington to untangle the intrigue behind  the arms transfer. But they are confident that the involvement of local  conspirators will be revealed.

A controversial Israeli entrepreneur, Maurice Sarfati -- sought by authorities  in both Antigua and the United States after defaulting on U.S.-guaranteed loans  of $1.3 million on a melon farm here -- and ex-Lt. Col. Yair G. Klein, a former  anti-terrorist officer of the Israeli army who has been charged in Jerusalem  with illegally providing military equipment and training to Colombians, are  other key figures in the scandal.    The gunshot-riddled body of a third Israeli, Arik Afek, a known Klein  associate, was found stuffed in the trunk of a car at Miami International  Airport last Jan. 24, and the Miami police are trying to determine whether he,  too, was involved.    When news of the arms scandal broke last April, following a formal diplomatic  protest by Colombia, attention focused on Vere Jr., 53, as the key Antiguan  official involved in engineering the scheme. His brother, Deputy Prime Minister  Lester Bird, 52, was first to point a finger, not only implicating Vere Jr. but  also hiring Washington lawyer Lawrence Barcella -- a former assistant U.S.  attorney for the District of Columbia famed for tracking down rogue CIA agent  Edwin Wilson in Libya in the early 1980s -- to investigate.    Lester Bird's hostility toward Vere Jr. is of long standing. In a struggle that  has often assumed the qualities of a melodramatic soap opera, the millionaire  brothers, both London-trained lawyers, have been vying ""like Cain and Abel,"" as  Vere Jr. once put it, to succeed their faltering octogenarian father, now  serving his sixth five-year term as prime minister.    The elder Bird has remained largely out of the fray and out of public sight,  shielded in recent years by his protective 27-year-old mistress, Cutie Francis,  a powerful local businesswoman who has been at his side since she was a  14-year-old beauty queen.    But protests concerning the arms scandal forced ""Papa"" Bird, as he is known  here, to go public last month and order an official commission of inquiry, run  by an impartial London jurist. The commission is scheduled to open hearings  here today.    No matter how the inquiry turns out, all three Birds may already have suffered  fatal political damage from the arms scandal, according to opposition  politicians and some of their allies in the Antigua Labor Party.    ""This could mean the end of the Bird dynasty,"" said Baldwin Spencer, opposition  leader in the 17-member Parliament.    John St. Luce, minister of finance and longtime Papa Bird supporter, said:  ""People think the era of the Birds is over. It's not a monarchy, not a  dynasty.""    Unless investigators turn up an innocent explanation of Israel's role in the  incident, Jerusalem, too, stands to suffer from the scandal.    Although Israel may not have known that the guns were destined for the drug  cartel, ""they had to know the deal was fishy, that this wasn't a legitimate  arms deal between governments,"" said an official who has closely followed the  investigation.    He said that ever since part of the arms shipment was discovered on the late  drug lord's Colombian ranch last Feb. 2, Israel has been ""dragging its heels""  and offering only token cooperation to Antiguan investigators trying to unravel  the scandal.    ""Is this just the tip of the iceberg?"" asked the official who spoke on  condition of anonymity. ""Were there other shipments? What else are they trying  to cover up?""    He said that Washington, too, should be embarrassed and added: ""The U.S.  government has shown a clear lack of interest in clarifying this scandal. We  have a good, clear trail here that can actually be followed and perhaps open  other trails to the narco-traffickers, yet it's not being pursued. Why?""    A Washington congressional source familiar with details of the scandal said he  believes the Bush Administration has so far stood aloof because it does not  want to make diplomatic trouble for Israel or get entangled in an explosive  internal quarrel here that might endanger agreements that permit highly  secretive U.S. Navy and Air Force bases to operate without restriction.    If Klein, the former Israeli army officer, can be believed, Washington may be  covering up its own role in the affair. Klein's link to the drug lords was  disclosed last year when a U.S. television network showed him supervising the  arms training of men Colombian authorities identified as drug cartel assassins.  He said a few weeks ago, in an unsworn statement, that it all began with plans  to build a ""survival school"" on the island.    Earlier, Klein told the Miami Herald that the deal grew out of a 1988 attempt  to establish a base on Antigua where pro-U.S. rebel forces could be trained to  topple former Panama strongman Manuel A. Noriega. He said he had no contact  with U.S. officials in planning the never-activated training base but that the  anti-Noriega Panamanians involved in the deal might have had.    The State Department says it has expressed ""concern about these arms"" to  Israel. Richard Boucher, a department spokesman, said in early May: ""We are  clearly concerned when government-licensed weapons end up in the hands of  narcotics trafficking organizations. We urge governments involved to  aggressively investigate the incident and take appropriate judicial action.""    Antiguan officials doubt that their commission of inquiry will get enough  cooperation from either Jerusalem or Washington to untangle the intrigue behind  the arms transfer. But they are confident that the involvement of local  conspirators will be revealed.

Top politicians - including African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela, President F W de Klerk and Inkatha Freedom Party leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi  -appear to have discussed the meeting when they attended an Easter Sunday church service in northern Transvaal. Mr Mandela said afterwards that the peace summit, which was to have taken place last week, would be held on Friday. The death toll in Natal province since the state of emergency was imposed on Thursday stood last night at 61. In one of the worst weekend incidents, nine people, including a baby and five children, died on Saturday when a gang fired on a rural home near Port Shepstone. The family were said to be ANC supporters. South African defence forces were deployed in Natal since the imposition of the state of emergency in the province. A combination of the Easter holiday and a quiet response to the move by Chief Buthlezi, chief minister of KwaZulu homeland and the Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini may have helped eased tension. Mr Mandela said last Thursday that he expected the controversial KwaZulu police force to be confined to barracks but the 4,000-strong force has been allowed to continue normal duties. The chain of command remains unclear and security force chiefs have referred the question back to Pretoria. Meanwhile, Chief Buthlezi's Inkatha Freedom Party appeared to be picking up support in Natal, according to the last public opinion poll allowed before the general election on April 27-29. A poll for the Johannesburg Sunday Times suggests that, if Inkatha had not boycotted the election, it would have been neck and neck with the ANC for control of Natal. The poll was conducted before the imposition of the emergency. National support for the ANC had fallen from 40.9 per cent last November to 31.9 per cent in March, the poll reported. Backing for Inkatha had risen from 18.7 per cent to 27.5 per cent. The paper suggests Inkatha's advance may be due to the entry in the political arena of the Zulu king with a demand for recognition of the Zulu nation.   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.

His statement followed a three-hour meeting with ANC leader Nelson Mandela at  which they discussed violence in South Africa's black townships, which has  killed about 800 people since mid-August.    De Klerk said exiles, many based in Zambia and other southern African nations,  can immediately begin applying for amnesty for ""political offenses.""    But he cautioned: ""No indemnity for anyone, or for any event or offense, is  granted automatically."" He said any possible indemnity would apply only to acts  committed before Monday's meeting.    The move could help resolve one of the major stumbling blocks to peace talks  between the white-led government and the ANC, which has demanded the return of  its estimated 20,000 exiles before beginning full-scale negotiations on  black-white power sharing and ending apartheid.

It also said exiles from other organizations may be included. Smaller black  opposition groups also have members who fled South Africa after committing  politically motivated acts.    The government also agreed to release 15 more political prisoners this week,  the statement said. Dozens have been freed in recent months, but up to 3,000  remain imprisoned, according to the ANC.    Mandela, after the meeting with De Klerk, read a separate joint statement.

0,FT931-15335 ,"FT931-15335 _AN-DAMCCAESFT 930113   FT  13 JAN 93 / Schluter in fight to beat 'Tamilgate'      By LIONEL BARBER and REUTER      COPENHAGEN, REYKJAVIK   DENMARK's minority government yesterday laid plans to prevent its possible downfall over the 'Tamilgate' affair, the scandal alleged to involve deliberate delays in granting entry visas to Tamil refugees from Sri Lanka. Mr Poul Schluter, prime minister, held the first cabinet meeting of the new year to discuss the likely fall-out from a 6,000-page judicial report to be published tomorrow. The report investigates charges that Mr Schluter knowingly misled parliament over the visa restrictions which legal experts argue were introduced in 1987 in breach of Denmark's liberal immigration law. A damning report could seal the fate of Mr Schluter's conservative liberal coalition, which has held power for 10 years, and prompt an early general election, an embarrassment for Denmark, which holds the EC presidency. An election campaign could also complicate plans for a second referendum on the Maastricht treaty, which Mr Schluter said yesterday could be held on April 27. But Danish officials and politicians yesterday insisted a switch of government would not harm prospects for Maastricht since seven out of Denmark's eight parties now supported the treaty under a special deal agreed at the Edinburgh summit last month. Mr Helvig Pedersen, leader of the Radical Liberals, who hold the swing position in parliament, said one reason voters rejected Maastricht last June was their concern about losing Danish citizenship in a European political union. 'We are a homogeneous population with almost the same race and the same religion. We are not used to black people coming in,' he declared. In the past, most immigrants in Denmark came from Scandinavia, Germany and the UK, but the collapse of the Soviet empire and the Yugoslav civil war has raised migrant pressures on Denmark's 5m population. Last year, 15,000 asylum seekers came to Denmark, including 9,000 from Yugoslavia. As in Germany, Danish politicians are considering tighter laws on asylum seekers. Visas are required for people coming from Serbia, but broader controls are provoking opposition from the Liberal and Social Democratic parties. One option is to introduce 'temporary refugee status', offering shelter without incurring the obligation of taking in relatives of refugees. This would probably have prevented the 'Tamilgate' scandal which turns on whether the then justice minister broke the law by denying Tamil refugees the right to bring their close relatives to Denmark. Iceland voted narrowly yesterday to join the European Economic Area (EEA), closing the longest debate ever in the world's oldest parliament, Reuter reports from Reykjavik. After bitter arguments over sovereignty, the Althing accepted the agreement reached between the EC and the European Free Trade Association (Efta).

This week he may have a  presidential palace at his disposal -- the official residence of  former Ciskei ruler Brigadier Oupa Gqozo.    Sentenced to life for sabotage, the grey-haired Mhlaba is  now  the ANC's premier-designate for the Eastern Cape.    He was born in Mazoka Village in the Fort Beaufort District  in 1920, and initially worked in a laundry in Port Elizabeth  after leaving school.    An active trade unionist during the 1940s, he was one of the  ANC leaders arrested during the transport boycott of 1952.    After the ANC was banned he joined other exiles doing  military training.    Returning to South Africa in 1962, he commanded Umkhonto we  Sizwe [Spear of the Nation; ANC military wing] until 1963, when  he was arrested along with Nelson Mandela and others at a farm  in Rivonia.    He served time on Robben Island, but was transferred to  Pollsmoor in 1982, where by special permission he married his  common-law wife and mother of his three children, Dedika Heliso,  in 1986.    Nelson Mandela was a witness at the ceremony, conducted in  the prison commandant's office.    Afterwards Mhlaba was legally permitted to touch his wife  for  the first time in 22 years.    After his release in October 1989, he was elected to the ANC  National Executive and SA [South African] Communist Party  Central Committee.    In January 1994 he was chosen as the ANC's premier-designate  for a unified Eastern Cape.    The region includes Transkei, Ciskei, the Border and the  Eastern Province, and is plagued by massive unemployment and a  legacy of underdevelopment.    Top priorities, according to Mhlaba, are job creation,  education and housing, and basic needs like water and  electricity.    Mhlaba, who has played an active role in the Eastern Cape  development forum, believes one way of dealing with these  problems is for agriculture and manufacturing in the region to  develop export markets. He has also emphasised the importance  of restoring law and order.    Ironically Mhlaba may take over the unified region only to  see it split in two -- a proposal being widely discussed.  Bisho, capital of the former Ciskeian state, is the Eastern  Cape regional capital. There has been speculation that Mhlaba  will move into Brigadier Gqozo's luxury residence.    However a spokesman for the premier-designate's office in  King William's Town said he did not believe Mhlaba had taken a  decision on the matter. This would depend on discussions with  the provincial secretary and coordinator, who were making  logistic arrangements.     "

NHK said prosecutors plan to arrest Kajima's former Vice  President Shinji Kiyoyama on suspicion of involvement in the  sending of the money to Nakamura.    It also said prosecutors will raid offices involved and hold  a meeting shortly to discuss how to handle the probe following  Nakamura's rejection to come forward for questioning.    Investigators suspect Nakamura accepted the 10 million yen  in  reward for his influence to help prevent the lodging of a  criminal complaint against contractors by a trade watchdog body  over bid- rigging practices. Nakamura's deed may constitute  bribery, investigative sources said.    If convicted, a bribe taker could be imprisoned for up to  five years, according to the penal code.    Nakamura, 44, an incumbent conservative member of the House  of Representatives, was a senior member of the Liberal  Democratic Party (LDP)'s construction lobby at the time of the  receipt of the money.    He served as construction minister from December 1992 to  August 1993 under then Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa.    Law enforcement authorities are required to ask for  permission from the Diet for the arrest of a legislator while  the legislature is in session. The Diet is currently in a  150-day ordinary session that started in late January.    Kajima's Kiyoyama, who is suspected of sending the money to  Nakamura, allegedly asked him to put pressure on the Fair Trade  Commission (FTC) not to file an accusation with prosecutors  against a bid-rigging scandal involving Kajima and 65 other  construction firms in Saitama Prefecture, just north of Tokyo.    A local executive of Kajima, one of Japan's three largest  general contractors, reportedly served as head of a club of the  66 construction companies involved in bid-rigging in the  prefecture.    At the time, Nakamura served as the deputy chairman of the  LDP's panel on the Antimonopoly Law.    Nakamura reportedly met then FTC Chairman Setsuo Umezawa,  62,  several times from the end of 1991 to early 1992 to discuss the  FTC's activities.    The FTC, investigating the scandal involving public works  projects in Saitama Prefecture, announced in May 1992 it would  not file an accusation and instead ordered the 66 companies to  stop the allegedly unfair business practices.    Kiyoyama, 67, has already been charged with giving a 20  million yen bribe to former Ibaraki Gov. Fujio Takeuchi while he  was in office.    In a series of scandals involving major contractors,  prosecutors have so far indicted two governors, two mayors and  dozens of executives of construction firms. No Diet member has  so far been arrested.     "

(Call (213) 206-FILM.)    The prolific Ruiz (more than 60 films, long and short, in two decades) is not  unknown to U.S. buffs. But his films do have qualities that made him an  outsider in the conservative atmosphere of '80s U.S. movie distribution.  They're intellectual, full of complex dialogue, symbolism, paradox and  narrative and technical trickery -- and they open windows on interesting new  currents in European art, theater, music, philosophy and literature. All the  more reason for audiences that may be starved for offbeat sensibilities to seek  him out.    Tonight's bill includes two of my favorites in the series: the 1980 short,  ""Snakes and Ladders,"" and the somewhat longer 1978 ""Hypothesis of a Stolen  Painting."" The weakest film, ""The Real Presence"" (1978), is a disquisition on  theater that, apparently, began as a TV documentary on the Avignon Festival and  somehow metamorphosed into an intricate mix of report, personal drama and  nightmare -- centering on the misadventures of an unemployed actor hired as the  broadcast anchor.    ""Snakes and Ladders,"" on the other hand, is a playful little fantasy-travelogue  conceived in the Byzantine riddle mode of Jorge Luis Borges, a writer with whom  Ruiz is often compared. It's another assignment-gone-wild: in this case, a  promotion film for a cartography exhibit at the Centre Pompidou, turned into a  fantastic puzzle-tale. The protagonist, after happening on two strangers  playing a board game in a field, immediately realizes, according to the  narrator ""that he is in a nightmare -- and the worst kind of nightmare; a  didactic one."" He is dispatched into a larger game in which he is, variously,  player, game-piece and dice. Ruiz, a real master in these short, cryptic forms,  makes this promo-film a bracingly deadpan fable-myth full of intellectual  twists and japes.    ""Hypothesis of a Stolen Painting"" was co-written with avant-garde novelist  Pierre Klossowski -- from whom Ruiz adapted ""The Stolen Vocation."" Here, the  Borgesian rhyme is even louder. The riddle-story is disguised as an art  lecture, with a wordy academic actually walking into the paintings of a  forgotten and fictitious petit master, ""Tonnerre"" -- as he attempts to unravel  for us the mystery behind a strange scandal that supposedly gripped Paris on  their first exhibition.    Soon, he -- and another narrator -- are discovering arcane clues everywhere  (mirrors, shadows, glances or smiles).

Column; Motion Picture Review    "," LA073190-0049   254804    July 31, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition      Calendar; Part F; Page 7; Column 1; Entertainment Desk      509 words      SPECIAL SCREENINGS: PROLIFIC, PROVOCATIVE RUIZ HAS A TRIPLE BILL      By MICHAEL WILMINGTON      Of the many excellent foreign language filmmakers who rarely or never made it  to U.S. theaters in the 1980s, one of the most provocative is French/Chilean  Raul Ruiz -- represented by a strong triple bill tonight at the close of the  UCLA Archive's retrospective. (Call (213) 206-FILM.)    The prolific Ruiz (more than 60 films, long and short, in two decades) is not  unknown to U.S. buffs. But his films do have qualities that made him an  outsider in the conservative atmosphere of '80s U.S. movie distribution.  They're intellectual, full of complex dialogue, symbolism, paradox and  narrative and technical trickery -- and they open windows on interesting new  currents in European art, theater, music, philosophy and literature. All the  more reason for audiences that may be starved for offbeat sensibilities to seek  him out.    Tonight's bill includes two of my favorites in the series: the 1980 short,  ""Snakes and Ladders,"" and the somewhat longer 1978 ""Hypothesis of a Stolen  Painting."" The weakest film, ""The Real Presence"" (1978), is a disquisition on  theater that, apparently, began as a TV documentary on the Avignon Festival and  somehow metamorphosed into an intricate mix of report, personal drama and  nightmare -- centering on the misadventures of an unemployed actor hired as the  broadcast anchor.    ""Snakes and Ladders,"" on the other hand, is a playful little fantasy-travelogue  conceived in the Byzantine riddle mode of Jorge Luis Borges, a writer with whom  Ruiz is often compared. It's another assignment-gone-wild: in this case, a  promotion film for a cartography exhibit at the Centre Pompidou, turned into a  fantastic puzzle-tale. The protagonist, after happening on two strangers  playing a board game in a field, immediately realizes, according to the  narrator ""that he is in a nightmare -- and the worst kind of nightmare; a  didactic one."" He is dispatched into a larger game in which he is, variously,  player, game-piece and dice. Ruiz, a real master in these short, cryptic forms,  makes this promo-film a bracingly deadpan fable-myth full of intellectual  twists and japes.    ""Hypothesis of a Stolen Painting"" was co-written with avant-garde novelist  Pierre Klossowski -- from whom Ruiz adapted ""The Stolen Vocation."" Here, the  Borgesian rhyme is even louder. The riddle-story is disguised as an art  lecture, with a wordy academic actually walking into the paintings of a  forgotten and fictitious petit master, ""Tonnerre"" -- as he attempts to unravel  for us the mystery behind a strange scandal that supposedly gripped Paris on  their first exhibition.    Soon, he -- and another narrator -- are discovering arcane clues everywhere  (mirrors, shadows, glances or smiles). And the apparently simple  academic-realistic paintings, with their cliched mythological or family  portrait subjects become the reflection of a perverse, violent family sexual  scandal and a sinister, perhaps worldwide, conspiracy. Absorbing stuff. Like  ""Snakes and Ladders,"" it makes you wonder what kind of magic Ruiz could weave  with more opulent budgets.      Column; Motion Picture Review    "

""Policemen, frequently abused as 'oppressors' by radicals, are  if anything exposed to greater dangers than members of the  Defence Force and Peacekeeping Force. Glaring disparities in  salaries cannot be justified.""

Meanwhile, ""the ANC, our next ruling party, is distracted by  its drive to annihilate its political opponents and is  apparently indifferent to the likely effects of its current  actions and promises on South Africa's long-term economic  health. Vague affirmations of economic rectitude are no longer  adequate. If the past weeks' damage to investor confidence is  to be repaired, unequivocal commitments are needed to economic  and political policies that investors find comfortable.""     "

His appointment as first deputy-president significantly  increases his chances as ANC crown prince, favoured to succeed  Nelson Mandela as leader. He is also the ANC national chairman.    Both his parents were teachers and activists. His father,  Govan, was a university graduate who was later jailed on Robben  Island for his part in the ANC's campaign against apartheid.    Earlier, Govan was a leading figure in ANC activities in the  Eastern Cape.    Thabo Mbeki joined the ANC Youth League at 14 and quickly  became active in student politics. After his schooling at  Lovedale was interrupted by a strike in 1959, he completed his  studies at home. Thereafter, he moved to Johannesburg where he  came under the guidance of Walter Sisulu and Duma Nokwe.    While studying for his A-levels, he was elected secretary of  the African Students' Association (ASA).    He went on to study economics as a correspondence student  with London University.    The ASA collapsed following the arrest of many of its  members, at a time when political movements were coming under  increasingly severe attack from the state. Mbeki's father was  arrested at Rivonia and sentenced to life imprisonment.    Thabo Mbeki left the country in 1962 under orders from the  ANC. From Tanzania, he moved to Britain where he completed a  Masters Degree in Economics at Sussex University in 1966.  Remaining active in student politics, he played a prominent role  in building the youth and student sections of the ANC in exile.    After his studies, he worked at the London office with the  late Oliver Tambo, who was to become ANC president, and Dr Yusuf  Dadoo before being sent to the Soviet Union in 1970 for military  training.    Later that year, he arrived in Lusaka where he was soon  appointed assistant secretary of the revolutionary council.    In 1975, he was acting ANC representative in Swaziland.    Appointed to the ANC National Executive Committee in 1975,  he  served as ANC representative to Nigeria until 1978, then moved  to Lusaka to become political secretary in the office of Oliver  Tambo, and then director of information.    From this position, he played a major role in turning the  international media against apartheid. His other role in the  '70s was in building the ANC in Swaziland and underground  structures inside South Africa.    During the '80s, Mbeki rose to head the Department of  Information and Publicity and co-ordinated diplomatic campaigns  to involve more white South Africans in anti-apartheid  activities.     "

This is a victory which  thousands of members of COSATU have worked tirelessly for over  the last few months. It is fitting that workers were able to  celebrate this victory on May Day.    The decisive victory of the African National Congress is a  triumph for the people of South Africa in their struggle for  democracy and social justice. In particular it is a victory for  the working people. Workers voted for the ANC in their millions  because the ANC has represented their aspirations over the  years, and has a clear plan to build a better life for them and  their families.    The overwhelming majority of workers voted against the  negative and racist campaign of the NP [National Party]. They  voted in the knowledge that NP rule means exploitation,  division, and privilege for the few.    The ANC's positive message of peace, jobs, housing,  education, and a better life for all struck a deep chord in the  working people of our country. This message had credibility  because of the clear programme of reconstruction and development  [RDP] which the ANC put to the nation.    COSATU welcomes last night's statement of President Mandela  that the RDP will be the cornerstone of the government of  national unity, and that all parties will be expected to work  within this framework. We believe that this is the unambiguous  mandate given by the electorate. Trade unions and other  organisations of civil society will do all in our power to  ensure that the RDP is not blocked by any grouping elections [as  received]. We dip our flag in the memory of COSATU members and  leaders killed in their attempt to ensure free political  activity, including those comrades killed in Ulundi shortly  before the elections.    Now is the time for us to rebuild our country and  reconstruct  our economy. We call on business to join us and the democratic  government in creating jobs and basic social infrastructure for  all our people. The prospects for a significant economic boom  are extremely bright. We must not squander this opportunity on  speculative economic activity and white elephants. Our priority  is to restructure our industries in a manner which creates  sustainable economic growth and development aimed at addressing  poverty and extreme inequality. If all South Africans commit  themselves to this goal, we will witness an economic and social  miracle unprecedented in our country's history.     "

Though long overdue, the welcome  step has removed a major barrier to negotiations between the white minority  government and the black majority.    The restrictions were imposed in 1986. Since then, police have arrested and  detained, often without charges, more than 30,000 people, most of them black  men and women. The provisions also forced thousands into hiding and silenced  most dissent in that divided nation.    The emergency regulations remain intact in the Natal province, where at least  4,000 people have died in fighting among rival black political groups. De Klerk  should reconsider the state of emergency there because the harsh restrictions  have not helped curb the killing. That responsibility lies largely with black  leaders -- especially Zulu Chief Gatsha Buthelezi, whose Inkatha movement is  involved in much of the violence.    De Klerk deserves credit for ending the oppressive emergency rule and the other  steps he has taken to create a climate conducive to negotiating a nonracial  democracy. He has freed Nelson Mandela, wrongly imprisoned by the government  for 27 years, and unbanned the African National Congress. He met last month  with Mandela in what was the first serious meeting between the white government  and ANC since the anti-apartheid group was founded in 1912. And he kept his  pledge to work for the repeal of public segregation.    But while ending racial segregation in buses, restaurants, parks and other  public places may make life a little less demeaning for black South Africans,  it is at best a modest reform in a nation where, by law, the majority is  segregated in housing, education and employment -- and still has no right to  vote.    De Klerk has signaled he is ready to start serious negotiations to change that  political system. But the ANC has set several conditions, including the return  of exiles and amnesty for all political prisoners, who, like Mandela, fought  against apartheid, before negotiations can begin.    As the world watches, Mandela is taking his anti-apartheid crusade to the rest  of Africa, Europe and North America. He is scheduled to visit the United States  later this month, and will meet with President Bush. De Klerk had been  scheduled for an earlier visit to the White House. But as opposition to that  visit grew in this country, he postponed his trip in yet another demonstration  of his keen political acumen.    By lifting the state of emergency throughout most of South Africa, De Klerk has  hastened change.

SOME WORRY THAT THE TOUGH NEW STRATEGY MAY GO TOO FAR.      By ROBERT SHOGAN, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER      PORTLAND, Ore.      Democratic Party leaders, gathered here this weekend from around the country,  are planning a double-barreled offensive against President Bush for reneging on  his no-new-taxes campaign promise and on the GOP for its handling of the  savings and loan scandal.    ""We're going to take off the gloves,"" national chairman Ron Brown told the  opening session of the summer conference of the Assn. of State Democratic  Chairs here Friday, only a few hours after Bush tried to defend his switch on  taxes in a nationally televised press conference.    Meanwhile, the Democratic National Committee research staff put the finishing  touches on a strategy memorandum for distribution to the state party officials  and Democratic candidates. A draft version made available to the press urges  Democrats to emphasize that the Bush Administration ""is failing to make the  S&L crooks pay,"" that the Administration's bailout plan is unfair and that  Democrats offer their own plan ""to make sure that these problems will never  happen again.""    Party strategists see the linkage of the tax hike and savings and loan issues  as made to order for them this campaign year as they strive to maintain their  control of Congress and most of the nation's statehouses.    The combination allows them to challenge the Republicans on what is supposed to  be their strongest ground -- stewardship of the nation's economy. ""The issue  here is fiscal mismanagement,"" said Ohio chairman Jim Ruvolo, president of the  state chairs association.    At the same time, the dual controversies also help the Democrats to emphasize  the sort of bread-and-butter concerns and populist rhetoric which have  traditionally been their stock in trade. ""I think just saying we ought to put  these crooks in jail is a good issue for Democrats,"" Bob Slagle, Texas party  chairman, said of the savings and loan issue.    To be sure, the Democrats face some obstacles in implementing this strategic  blueprint. On the tax issue, party leaders acknowledge the need for a measure  of restraint because they are still trying to live down their own reputation as  the party of tax hikes, which hurt them so seriously during the 1980s.    ""Some Democratic governors have had to ask for tax increases, too,"" Ruvolo  pointed out in suggesting that Democrats need to seem constructive in  responding to Bush's fiscal change of heart. ""If we can appear more fiscally  responsible, that's what the American people want,"" Ruvolo said. ""The party  that doesn't appear fiscally responsible is the one that is going to get hurt.""    Still, Democrats maintain that Bush's willingness to consider a tax increase  would shield their state and local officeholders who have backed tax increases  from attacks by Republican challengers.    The savings and loan issue also poses problems for Democrats because some of  their prominent officeholders have been embroiled in that controversy in one  way or another. Ties to the thrift industry made former House Speaker Jim  Wright of Texas and former House Majority Whip Tony Coelho of California  vulnerable to charges of unethical behavior which led to their resignations  from Congress last year.    In addition, four Democratic senators, Alan Cranston of California, Dennis  DeConcini of Arizona, John Glenn of Ohio and Donald W. Riegle Jr. of Michigan,  have come under fire because of their links to controversial savings and loan  operator Charles H. Keating.    The criticism of the Democratic connection to the scandal has been extensive  enough that Paul Goldman, Virginia state party chairman, objects to a  resolution submitted by national chairman Brown to the executive committee of  the national party, putting the blame for the scandal solely on the faulty  supervision and the economic philosophy of ""two successive Republican  administrations.""    ""The Democrats make a terrible mistake by saying it's totally the Republicans  fault,"" he said of the resolution which the executive committee is expected to  approve at its meeting here today. ""The media knows that's not true and so does  the public, and we'll lose our credibility,"" he added. Goldman advocates  creating a nonpartisan commission to investigate the root causes of the scandal  and calculate its ultimate cost.    But Brown shrugged off this criticism. ""Of course the Democrats bear some  responsibility,"" he said. ""But if you measure who is really responsible and on  whose watch it has occurred, it was this Administration which is responsible  for enforcing the laws of this country.""    Driving home the populist thrust of the Democratic attack, in a speech prepared  for delivery to today's executive committee meeting, Brown argues that Bush  refused to call for a tax increase to raise funds for a range of domestic needs  such as helping the homeless, increasing federal aid to education, bolstering  the nation's infrastructure or cleaning up the environment.    ""This summer, though, we have found the one cause for which George Bush is  willing to break his 'no-new-taxes' pledge,"" Brown said, ""the bankers and  speculators who ran the savings and loan industry into the ground.""

The criticism of the Democratic connection to the scandal has been extensive  enough that Paul Goldman, Virginia state party chairman, objects to a  resolution submitted by national chairman Brown to the executive committee of  the national party, putting the blame for the scandal solely on the faulty  supervision and the economic philosophy of ""two successive Republican  administrations.""    ""The Democrats make a terrible mistake by saying it's totally the Republicans  fault,"" he said of the resolution which the executive committee is expected to  approve at its meeting here today. ""The media knows that's not true and so does  the public, and we'll lose our credibility,"" he added. Goldman advocates  creating a nonpartisan commission to investigate the root causes of the scandal  and calculate its ultimate cost.    But Brown shrugged off this criticism. ""Of course the Democrats bear some  responsibility,"" he said. ""But if you measure who is really responsible and on  whose watch it has occurred, it was this Administration which is responsible  for enforcing the laws of this country.""    Driving home the populist thrust of the Democratic attack, in a speech prepared  for delivery to today's executive committee meeting, Brown argues that Bush  refused to call for a tax increase to raise funds for a range of domestic needs  such as helping the homeless, increasing federal aid to education, bolstering  the nation's infrastructure or cleaning up the environment.    ""This summer, though, we have found the one cause for which George Bush is  willing to break his 'no-new-taxes' pledge,"" Brown said, ""the bankers and  speculators who ran the savings and loan industry into the ground.""

0,FT944-6031 ,"FT944-6031 _AN-ELAD8AAYFT 941201   FT  01 DEC 94 / Top court acts in Indian bribes scandal      By STEFAN WAGSTYL      NEW DELHI   India's Supreme Court yesterday ordered the government to explain delays in the investigation of a Rs520m (Pounds 10.6m) scandal involving illegal foreign exchange deals and payments to top politicians and bureaucrats. The court called for an explanation why the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), the main criminal investigation agency, and the income tax and foreign exchange authorities had not dealt 'appropriately' with a case dating back to May 1991. The court order comes amid mounting public concern about corruption, especially bribes paid by businesses, including foreign companies, to secure public contracts. Allegations of corruption have figured prominently in four states which are currently holding local assembly elections. The court case stemmed from a public interest petition filed last year by Mr Vineet Narain, a leading journalist, asking the court to examine the CBI investigation into the affairs of Mr Surendra Jain, a New Delhi businessman with extensive political contacts who specialised in arranging power station contracts. The investigation began in early 1991 with a probe into black market foreign exchange transactions involving armed militant groups in the troubled northern state of Jammu and Kashmir. Investigators tracing a trail of suspicious-looking deals came across Mr Jain's name. In May 1991, the CBI raided premises belonging to Mr Jain's family and seized cash, and receipts for undeclared foreign exchange transactions totalling Rs520m. To their surprise, the investigators also found diaries detailing alleged payments to leading politicians and bureaucrats totalling just under Rs500m. According to the petition presented to the Supreme Court, the alleged recipients included Mr Rajiv Gandhi, the late prime minister, and other leading figures of the ruling Congress (I) party, among them Mr Bhajan Lal, the former agriculture minister, and Mr Kalpanath Rai, who was Mr Gandhi's energy minister and is now food minister. Two other alleged recipients were Mr Mohammed Arif Khan, another former power minister, and Mr LK Advani, leader of the opposition Bharatiya Janata party. Payments were also allegedly made to bureaucrats dealing with the electricity industry and to others, including the Delhi police chief. While some alleged recipients are named in full in the diaries, others are referred to by their initials. Virtually all those allegedly identified have denied to Indian journalists that they received any money from Mr Jain. Mr Narain, the petitioner, told the court that the CBI did nothing to investigate the case between May 1991 and July 1993, when he started his own inquiries. In an extraordinary admission, the solicitor general told the court the delay was caused partly by the fact that the CBI officer supervising the case was caught demanding bribes from Mr Jain to halt the investigation.

Zhuhai  authorities said the demolition was to prevent further accidents.    The official death toll from the collapse rose to 38 when  another 14 bodies were plucked from the three-storey debris.  The number of injured in Zhuhai's worst industrial accident  stood at ""more than 160"". A government spokesman said the  rescue would continue but was getting more difficult"".    Fire swept through the Yu Xin Textile Factory in Qianshan on  Thursday and the front half of the building caved in the  following day after torrential rain.    Two hundred workers were inside, having been ordered back by  their joint venture Hong Kong bosses to retrieve the cotton  stock.    After nearly four days of digging, Zhuhai authorities  decided  yesterday to use explosives to demolish the remaining half,  fearing it could collapse.    The explosion was set off at 5.20 pm, 75 hours after workers  were buried. The walls cracked and the building folded in the  centre and disappeared in a cloud of dust.    Public Security Bureau officers and the People's Liberation  Army sealed off a 500-metre area and city authorities declared a  news blackout on the operation.    A group of 20 Hong Kong and Macao journalists and  photographers hid behind bushes about 300 metres from the scene  for more than two hours, but were discovered by a soldier and  expelled minutes before the explosion. Their film was  confiscated.    Hong Kong unionists last night criticised the authorities  for  ending hopes of survivors. Winnie Tam Pik-yan, executive  secretary of the 130,000-strong Hong Kong Confederation of Trade  Unions, said: ""My God, how come the Government did that? How  about those still trapped?""    ""There may be people waiting for help. Although the chance  of their survival gets smaller as time goes by, no one can deny  them the chance.""    The Government should have waited at least a week before  blowing up the part of the factory still standing, she said.    Zhuhai officials said the explosion was ""directional"" and  would not affect the rubble where the missing workers were. An  official said bulldozers and heavy machinery would be brought in  today to remove debris.    Earlier, Zhuhai Municipal Government spokesman Yang  Shuisheng  said ""about 20"" workers were missing, but the chances of anyone  being alive were slim. The Government allowed relatives of the  dead mainly migrant workers from rural areas -- to identify  remains at the crematorium. Fourteen bodies were identified.    Most of the relatives were angry that the management had  sent  workers back into the damaged factory. Some shouted abuse and  gestured at management staff.    Relatives discussed compensation with the management but no  announcement was made.     "

And ties between the two big powers are facing a  rocky period. Lin Shaowen has the details.    Moscow said Wednesday [23 February] that it would expose CIA  agents in Russia in retaliation for accusations by the U.S. that  an American spy for Russian bought [as heard] secret documents.  It is the first time that Moscow has responded since the spying  case came to light this week. Aldrich Ames, the former chief of  the CIA's counterintelligence network, and his wife were  arrested in Washington on Monday. They were accused of spying  for the former Soviet Union and Russia for nine years. The  Department of Justice said that they had received more than $1.5  million for selling vital information on CIA operations and  personnel.    U.S. President Bill Clinton described the case as very  serious and ordered an official protest to the Russian  Government. Some American senators called on the government to  freeze aid for Russia immediately. Moscow had no reply in the  beginning. The U.S. demanded that Russia withdraw diplomats who  were involved in the spying case or America would take the  action themselves. But Russia would not bow under the pressure  easily. It has been enjoying the limelight after its successful  mediation of the Sarejevo crisis. Senior Russian officials said  that the spy scandal might have been revealed to discredit the  success of Russian foreign policy in the Balkan region. Russian  Presidential Spokesman Vyacheslav Kostikov said the case was a  return to the psychology of the Cold War. He said that  exaggerating the scandal would be harmful to relations between  the two countries. Russia has recently taken a tougher stance  on several issues. President Boris Yeltsin publicly criticized  the West for trying to resolve major international issues  without involving the Kremlin. Although the American Government  is uneasy about a stronger Russia, there is not much it can do  about it. Even a top White House official admitted that many  vital American interests are tied up in the relationship with  Russia. Washington has committed $2.5 billion of aid to Russia  this year to foster its economic reform. And even after the  espionage case surfaced, President Clinton reaffirmed that  Washington will continue to pursue its supportive policy toward  Yeltsin. Russia isn't likely to ignore the U.S. demands  completely. If it wants to restore its status as a superpower,  it will have to learn how to play ball according to a few rules.  The U.S. and Russia were old competitors for several decades.  In recent years, relations have become a lot warmer. But a lot  of negotiations are going to be needed this time to keep the  honeymoon going and the couple away from divorce court. For  China Radio International, I am Lin Shaowen.     "

Neither the White House nor the South African government had announced a date  for the meeting, but it reportedly had been set for June 18.    The African National Congress and others complained that a meeting on that date  with De Klerk would be a snub to African National Congress leader Nelson  Mandela, who is to arrive in the United States on June 20.    De Klerk and Mandela have said they do not care which one meets with Bush  first. But many ANC representatives and some black American leaders have said  that Bush should not meet with De Klerk at all until South Africa's apartheid  system is dismantled. It has been more than 30 years since a South African head  of government has visited the United States.    In Washington, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said that ""Mr. De Klerk  has notified us that he would prefer to wait until another time"" for his visit.  ""We are ready to see him whenever he wants.""    He said the change of schedule ""will have no impact"" on Mandela's visit.    The South African president returned Saturday from an 18-day visit to nine  European nations, where he met with leaders and explained his plans to end  apartheid and give the voteless black majority a voice in running the  government.    De Klerk is under pressure from white rightists for conceding too much to  blacks and he needs to demonstrate to his voters that his reforms are winning  support abroad for isolated South Africa.    Diplomats said the last thing he wants are television pictures of noisy,  possibly violent, anti-South African demonstrations in the United States.

For citizens of mature nations, to whom democracy is an old and devalued friend, voting is a banal political act uninspired by higher emotion. But South Africans came to the polls as political virgins: with their naivety and their faith, they cast their ballots overwhelmingly for the ideal of one nation, undivided by race. More than anything else, South Africa's future will depend on the success of efforts to realise that ideal. Nelson Mandela, who will today be inaugurated as the first president of a united South Africa, has devoted his life to that goal. He never lets the subject drop: every speech, including yesterday's address in Cape Town after he was elected president, stresses the need to reconcile South Africans to a common destiny. Constantly, he repeats the words he first uttered from the dock during the Rivonia treason trial 30 years ago: 'I have fought against white domination and I have fought against black domination. I have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons live together in harmony and with equal opportunities. It is an ideal which I hope to live for and to achieve. But if needs be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die.' Mr Mandela did not have to die; outgoing President FW de Klerk had the wisdom and vision to prevent such a disaster. But it was a close-run thing: Mr Mandela is nearly 76, and without the adrenalin and excitement of his release and the subsequent four years of political change, he might well have begun to fail. But Mr de Klerk knew that no other black leader would offer whites a better deal, and he desperately feared a race war. So he took the first inevitable step to racial reconciliation; the rest is up to Mr Mandela. The legacy of the recent elections will be no small help to him in this task. For as the chairman of the discredited Independent Electoral Commission, Judge Johann Kriegler, pointed out, the exercise had more to do with reconciling people than reconciling votes. (A convenient excuse from a man who proved completely unequal to the job of running a modern election, but true even so.) So ballots were not reconciled, and their legitimacy could not be proved. Perhaps that was just as well, for it gave political leaders the excuse to do their own kind of reconciliation: sharing out power more as they thought the voters ought to have done, than as they probably did; providing what one political insider called a 'designer outcome' to a messy and chaotic election. One local newspaper called it 'a dream come true'; those less given to hyperbole nonetheless thanked God (who pops up often in South African political discourse) for such a neat and happy outcome. For despite the electoral bungling and administrative farce which attended the birth of South African democracy, the politicians have delivered a result which stands a good chance of guaranteeing stability in years to come: a deal which binds all the major parties to the constitution, and leaves only the tiniest fringe to the left and right in extra-parliamentary opposition. The African National Congress is strong, but not dominant: it did not gain the two-thirds of the national vote which would have made it simpler to force through its ideas on a new constitution. And crucially, it did not win control of two important provinces, KwaZulu Natal, with a fifth of the country's population, and the western Cape. True to form, Mr Mandela welcomed his party's failure to pass the two-thirds threshold, hoping this would allay white fears of black domination. That was an essential part of the 'designer outcome': the ANC could not be allowed to win too many votes, or national reconciliation would be jeopardised. The National party passed the 20 per cent psychological barrier needed to give the party the power base from which to argue for minority interests within the government of national unity. And the Inkatha Freedom party won the province of KwaZulu Natal with a fraction more than 50 per cent of the vote, giving the party a one-seat majority in the 81-member provincial assembly. The ANC surrendered Natal - where some 15,000 people have died in the past decade in fighting which the ANC blames on the IFP - in the interests of peace. This was almost certainly the wisest course: for with Inkatha running well ahead in the polling (however crooked the results), the party of Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi would never have accepted defeat. Inkatha is likely to prove much less belligerent within government than outside; and it now has a vested interest in the success of the new order. The result has left South Africans in a pleasurable state of shock. The unimaginable is constantly made fact; sad old truths have been forgotten and the twin burdens of guilt and oppression lifted from the national spirit. The momentousness of what has happened - long foreseen but not quite grasped  -strikes home in the images of the new South Africa. Mr Mandela addresses the media from the steps of Tuinhuis, the elegant Cape Dutch mansion which houses the presidential offices; in this building five years ago, he took tea as a prisoner with outgoing President PW Botha, returning to his cell after tea was served. He poses for photos on the steps of the tri-cameral parliament constituted expressly to exclude blacks, and places his hand over his heart in allegiance as an official band plays Die Stem, the anthem of apartheid (now one of South Africa's two national anthems). In the historic Raadsaal (council chamber) in Bloemfontein, capital of the Orange Free State (last used at the turn of the century to house the parliament of the Orange Free State Boer republic), Patrick Lekota of the African National Congress is sworn in as premier of the new province of the same name. Five years ago, Lekota was serving a 12-year sentence for treason against the South African state. Now he is one of the most powerful men in the land. This scene is repeated throughout the country, as former prisoners take the salute from their captors. And every provincial premier conveys the same message: the need for racial reconciliation and investment to build a new South Africa. That is Mr Mandela's vision: the miracle is that his subordinates seem truly to have taken it to heart. Perhaps the spirit of reconciliation will not survive the new government's first five-year term in office; perhaps it will expire long before. But to hear the new ANC premier of the Johannesburg-Pretoria region, Mr Tokyo Sexwale, plead with the white right wing to join in the new South Africa - and not to closet themselves away in some forgotten corner of an arid homeland - is to believe that the new government's intentions are good. Mr Sekwale has even said he will forego the traditional triumphal act of African liberation: changing the names of streets and buildings to deny the European past. He understands the impact this would have on the white psyche, and seeks to avoid it. It is hard to see how such generous impulses could have survived the depredations of apartheid, but they have done: only 1.25 per cent of the electorate voted for a party whose appeal (though not its official platform) is based on black revenge, the Pan Africanist Congress. And though 400,000 whites voted for Gen Constand Viljoen and his dream of an Afrikaner homeland, this is far more a cultural than a racial concept. Overwhelmingly, South Africans voted against racism. But surely the best is now over: Nelson Mandela's inauguration brings to an end the era when the ANC was unquestionably on the right side of history. It must now dirty its hands with the politics and not just the rhetoric of nation-building. Mr Mandela's good intentions will be sorely tested in this phase. For there is a contradiction inherent in the twin goals of his new government: reconciliation and improving the living standards of the black population. If blacks advance too rapidly at the expense of whites, whether in terms of job opportunities or government spending, racial relations will be strained; if they continue to lag behind, the same will happen. In the end, race relations will worsen or improve as the economy fails or prospers, within parameters which may be set by the World Bank or the International Monetary Fund. For once equality is achieved at the ballot box, economic equality becomes the next target: no new nation can be built if the whites all leave because of economic decline, or if blacks languish forever in poverty. That is why Mr Mandela constantly appeals to whites to stay in South Africa, or return if they have left. Despite his best intentions, however, strains could quickly develop within the government of national unity. Though Mr Mandela tried to include several parties in his cabinet - even those who did not qualify for seats under the power-sharing constitution - this could work more to his advantage than theirs. In government, collective cabinet responsibility will force them to stifle criticism except in matters grave enough to provoke resignation. In his victory speech last week, Mr Mandela made clear that his definition of a government of national unity is one in which he gives the orders and others obey - especially when it comes to implementing the ANC's plan for black upliftment, the Reconstruction and Development Programme. Under the constitution, Mr Mandela is required to try to seek consensus on cabinet decisions; but if he cannot find it, he may act alone. When faced with a conflict of interest between his core constituency, blacks, and white privilege, he will have a hard choice to make. The carefully crafted gestures of reconciliation which marked his election campaign will then be tested for content as well as form: the hand stretched out to Mr de Klerk in their televised debate, the embrace for Chief Buthelezi on the floor of the new national assembly, provided the visual equivalent of sound bites. The next few months will tell whether they were indeed genuine, if not quite spontaneous. In the months and years to come, he will be called upon to implement the promises made from the dock 30 years ago: 'It is not true that the enfranchisement of all will result in racial domination. Political division, based on colour, is entirely artificial and, when it disappears, so will the domination of one colour group by another. The ANC has spent half a century fighting against racialism. When it triumphs it will not change that policy.' Perhaps these will go the way of all politicians' promises, and be withdrawn by a President Mandela, toughened and strengthened by power. And ironically, racial relations could actually worsen rather than improve with the end of apartheid, as heightened black expectations are inevitably frustrated and affluent whites take the blame. But luckily for South Africa, reconciliation does not in the end depend on the good intentions of one man and his organisation. South Africa's disparate peoples may share nothing in the way of race, language, ethnicity and ideology, but they recognise a common danger which unites them: the risk of mutually assured destruction. A capricious history brought them from Holland, India, England, Scotland, France and other parts of Africa; but over the past two weeks they have finally come to ac-knowledge that they share a common fate. As the benevolent glow of the past two weeks fades from memory, that fact will remain. Mr Mandela, the statesman, Mr de Klerk, the pragmatist, Gen Constand Viljoen, the soldier, and Mangosuthu Buthelezi, the chief, all accept a common truth: they cannot live without each other. They may not like the new South Africa, but they are stuck with it. There is no turning back.   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.   Industries:-  P9111 Executive Offices.

0,FT944-1473 ,"FT944-1473 _AN-ELTDSADDFT 941220   FT  20 DEC 94 / Leading Article: Mr Mandela takes stock   President Nelson Mandela's honeymoon with the South African electorate finally came to an end over the weekend, when the African National Congress (ANC), gathered in Bloemfontein for its first conference since it won elections in April. It would have been understandable if the party used the event to dwell on its extraordinary achievement since its inaugural gathering in the same city over 80 years ago. Instead the party is subjecting itself to a brutally frank critique of its performance in office. This is as it should be, for to do otherwise would smack of complacency. As Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, the secretary general, put it in his official report to the delegates, the ANC is a liberation movement still struggling to come to terms with its success at the ballot box last April. The party is heavily indebted, riven by 'cliques, factions, tensions and squabbles', he said. It has failed to tackle continuing township instability, rising crime and high unemployment, and is faced by one overriding concern: the failure to meet black expectations. No one expected it to be easy, given Mr Mandela's dilemma. South Africa's stability, and its appeal to foreign investors, rests on the new government's capacity to maintain white confidence. To do so, Mr Mandela has chosen to act pragmatically  - but in the process he has lost black support, particularly among impatient black youth. There is no simple way out for Mr Mandela. If he is to deliver on the key issues  - jobs, housing, education, land reform  - he has to preside over a growing economy. To do this, he must bring with him a white community whose role in both business and the security forces is disproportionate to its numbers. And most difficult of all, he must turn a civil service moulded by apartheid into a loyal, efficient administration, without which the best conceived policies will fail. Complex problems There are other brakes on the government's capacity to deliver. It is learning to live with a constitution which decentralises power to nine provincial assemblies. Although the ANC controls seven of them, they are developing minds of their own, not susceptible to reform by diktat. Add to this the complexity of the problems to be addressed, whether the huge housing backlog, or the gross disparity in land ownership. Nor is Mr Mandela's task made easier by the nature of the ANC itself. It is a still a coalition, originally driven by a single overriding objective  - the end of white minority rule. Now that has been achieved, the cracks in the coalition are emerging, for it encompasses a very broad political spectrum, ranging from advocates of market-driven policies, through militant trade unionists to members of the influential South African Communist party. State patronage In the past, Africa's leaders were able to sustain comparable coalitions after independence by resorting to state patronage through nationalisation and jobs in government service. Mr Mandela, however, has taken office in a new Africa, where economic policies are constrained by structural adjustment programmes which reduce such patronage through policies that include privatisation, market driven exchange rates, and trade liberalisation. In the longer term, it might well be healthy for development and democracy in South Africa if there was a fundamental realignment in the country's politics, with the left of the ANC breaking away and standing on its own platform. First, however, the party must put its own house in order. It must become an organised and focused political party, instead of a liberation coalition. And for the current five-year parliamentary session at least, the ANC and its partners in the government of national unity must work together to provide the jobs and social services that will form the foundations of the new South Africa. The danger, as Mr Mandela warned at the weekend, is that the ANC might attempt to regain lost popularity on the basis of populist rhetoric. If the party heeds his warning, and imposes discipline on its feuding factions, Bloemfontein could mark the moment when the ANC came to grips with its new responsibility.

Mandela, who is due to announce his Cabinet next week, is  likely to select three to five ""Cabinet secretaries"" to oversee  Cabinet Departments and make up the ANC's exclusive ""inner  sanctum"".    Tipped for these posts are Mbeki or Ramaphosa to oversee  Foreign Affairs and Defence, ANC economic planning department  head Trevor Manuel to oversee economic and financial matters and  SACP [South-African Communist Party] chairman Joe Slovo to  oversee judicial and constitutional issues. Other Cabinet  secretaries will oversee welfare, education, social services and  administration.    Having a ""cabinet within a Cabinet"" would allow Mandela to  retain Keys and Coetsee in their posts by making them  responsible to a higher, but less experienced, authority.    The debate over a Reconstruction and Development portfolio  is  continuing, with some arguing that it would cut across too many  other portfolios. Former COSATU [Congress of South African  Trade Unions] general secretary Jay Naidoo is favoured to take  such a portfolio.    Other good bets would be mainly from the ANC's national  executive committee, including: Law and Order -- Sydney  Mufamadi; Trade and Industry -- Tito Mboweni; Mineral and Energy  Affairs -- Marcel Golding; Health -- Nkosazana Zuma; Posts and  Telecommunications -- Pallo Jordan; Science and Technology --  Mohammed Valli Moosa; Women and Youth -- Gertrude Shope;  Information -- Gill Marcus; Sport -- Steve Tshwete;  Constitutional Development -- Zola Skweyiya; and Commission for  Administration -- Josiah Jele.    Other NP [National Party] members could be Foreign Minister  Pik Botha, Constitutional Affairs Minister Roelf Botha,  Constitutional Affairs Minister Roelf Meyer and Public  Enterprises Minister Dawie de Villiers. Meyer could be offered  Justice, but speculation that Botha will retain Foreign Affairs  is understood to be unfounded.    Mandela has indicated his desire to placate right-wing  whites  and could retain Agriculture Minister Kraai van Niekerk or his  deputy, Tobie Meyer.    He also wants to include a PAC member in the Cabinet and  could be constitutionally required to include Inkatha leader  Mangosuthu Buthelezi. Several minor posts, including Transport,  Water Affairs and Forestry, could go to these candidates.    Education could go to ANC education desk head John Samuels,  although he may not be elected in which case Randell van den  Heever could be a candidate.    Former ANC Youth League leader Peter Mokaba has positioned  himself to be Tourism Minister, while Mac Maharaj and Pravin  Gordhan are likely to be included. Former COSATU members,  including Chris Dlamini and Alec Erwin, seem likely candidates  for Manpower Minister.     "

After almost 12 hours of talks at an eastern Transvaal game reserve, the country's four most important political leaders - President FW de Klerk, Mr Nelson Mandela, the African National Congress leader, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, the Inkatha Freedom party leader, and Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini - admitted they had made little progress in resolving their differences. Chief Buthelezi and Mr Mandela openly quarrelled during a press conference which followed the meeting and King Goodwill made it clear he would advise the Zulu people to boycott the elections to be held on April 26-28. The failure of the meeting, one of the most important in four years of peace talks, could exacerbate violence in the troubled Natal province, where tension is high after the recent imposition of a state of emergency. ANC officials said last night they expected to tighten emergency measures in Natal almost immediately, which could provoke further violence. The four leaders said they would set up a task force to continue seeking solutions to the problems which have provoked violence between their supporters. However, ANC and Inkatha officials said privately this was largely a face-saving measure and no progress was made at yesterday's talks. Mr Mandela said repeatedly he had 'no exaggerated expectation' that the task force could reach a settlement. 'The (Zulu) king's reservations cannot properly be addressed by a task force but only by a government of national unity,' which would take power after the election. In a tough statement Chief Buthelezi said: 'Progress could not be made on most of the fundamental issues tabled by the king and the Inkatha Freedom party.' Earlier, King Goodwill had asserted his people's 'claim to sovereignty and self-determination' for KwaZulu, the self-governing homeland in Natal. ANC officials had hoped the king would prove more conciliatory than Chief Buthelezi, seen as the driving force in the demand for an autonomous KwaZulu. The ANC had hoped to divide King Goodwill from Chief Buthelezi, his uncle and chief political adviser, by offering the king a separate peace guaranteeing his status and income. However the move appeared to have backfired with the king and Chief Buthelezi emerging from the meeting equally defiant. As the king was speaking at the summit, the ANC warned of impending assassination attempts on its leaders. A statement implicated Inkatha in what it called 'a comprehensive plan of intimidation and violence'. Blood brothers, Weekend I   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.

0,FT942-11873 ,"FT942-11873 _AN-EEDEHABEFT 940504   FT  04 MAY 94 / Mandela insists on fruits of liberation: Patti Waldmeir and Mark Suzman ask whether the new South Africa can afford them      By PATTI WALDMEIR   Mr Nelson Mandela made one thing abundantly clear when he claimed electoral victory on Monday night: that he will be moved by the spirit of reconciliation and compromise on all issues bar one - his economic plan for uplifting black South Africans, known as the Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP). The message of the man who will henceforth dominate South African politics was unambiguous: he will tolerate no opposition in implementing this programme; and anyone who disagrees with it need not bother entering the government of national unity. His comments demonstrate the fact that Mr Mandela and his African National Congress see the advancement of black South Africans as the true goal of decades of liberation struggle. If political power cannot be used to ease black poverty, it is not worth having, they would argue. The foreword to the RDP puts the case even more categorically: 'No political democracy can survive and flourish if the mass of our people remain in poverty, without land, without tangible prospects for a better life.' The ANC cannot expect to remain in power unless it meets these basic needs. Mr Jay Naidoo, who may be appointed to head a special ministry charged with implementing the programme, says its objectives must be met or 'none of us is going to survive'. The programme sets ambitious goals; over the next five years 1m homes are to be built, 2.5m houses electrified, clean water, sanitation and health care provided for all. But it also includes a commitment to fiscal discipline and the need to maintain macro-economic balance. 'We must finance the RDP in ways that do not cause undue inflation or balance of payments difficulties,' it says, adding that 'the vast bulk of the RDP will be financed by existing resources organised, rationalised and directed within RDP guidelines'. But the ANC's plans for 'increasing the efficiency of consumption expenditure and improving the revenue recovery capacities of government' display a touching faith in the powers of the new broom - and a naive belief in the willingness of government to cut defence spending. Mr Naidoo expects a 3 per cent annual rise in the productivity of the civil service. But the ANC's agreement not to sack white civil servants in large numbers, coupled with its commitment to promote blacks through affirmative action, may, conversely, lead to a rise in the cost of the public service. And with nine new provincial administrations set up under the constitution and a host of new parastatal bodies created by the RDP itself, it is hard to share the ANC's optimism about productivity gains. So too is it difficult to believe that R3.83bn (Pounds 717m) will be saved from defence spending. It is also worth noting that though the plan cites the need for fiscal discipline, a commitment to keep the budget deficit at 6 per cent of gross domestic product, included in early drafts, was removed from the final plan. Costing the plan is difficult: the ANC says it has budgeted R39bn for the five-year programme. The National party claims the true cost will be R70bn in the first year alone, rising to more than R600bn for the full five years. Given that the financing of the RDP is at best vague, at worst unrealistic, only time will tell which will turn out to be the true figure. Still, the South African business community does not seem to be panicking over the plan, largely because the ANC has shown such eagerness to consult widely on the programme and seek the commitment of business at every stage. As economist Mr Rudolf Gouws of Rand Merchant Bank points out, the final draft has removed many of the 'rough edges' of earlier drafts, making it more difficult to criticise. And the original heavily 'statist' emphasis of the draft has been substantially softened, with ANC officials keen to play up the party's corporatist intentions, rather than its anti-capitalist past. The real test will come if an ANC government must choose between either implementing the plan or raising taxes and printing money. For the moment, its intentions are virtuous; they will be sorely tested by a spell in power.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                    SOUTH AFRICAN ELECTION RESULTS  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Electorate 23m                                        Votes      % of                                                  total  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- African National Congress (ANC)        7.42m     62.5% National Party (NP)                    2.62m     22.1% Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP)            0.99m      8.3% Freedom Front (FF)                     0.32m      2.7% Democratic Party (DP)                  0.21m      1.7% Pan Africanist Congress (PAC)          0.15m      1.3%  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- * Provisional results for the National Assembly based on 12.07m votes counted out of the estimated 23m cast.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.

0,FT942-11714 ,"FT942-11714 _AN-EEDEHAFTFT 940504   FT  04 MAY 94 / Markets Report: Dollar remains fragile      By PHILIP GAWITH   The dollar yesterday fell to its lowest level in more than six months against the D-Mark, but there was no public evidence of further central bank support for the currency, writes Philip Gawith. The dollar closed in London at DM1.6461, more than a pfennig down on its Friday close of DM1.657. Against the yen it finished at Y101.315 from Y101.485. Trade was fairly quiet, following the UK long weekend and with Japanese markets closed for most of the week. The dollar's woes spilled over into sterling, which finished nearly three pfennigs lower at DM2.483, from Friday's close of DM2.5126. Political uncertainty ahead of tomorrow's local elections is also weighing on the UK currency. Elsewhere, a controversy in Spain surrounding the disappearance of a former senior police official undermined the peseta and the escudo. While there was no repeat of Friday's Fed support for the dollar, there was talk of concerted European central bank dollar purchases at Dollars 1.6450. Since these activities are normally conducted through commercial banks, their origins are not always clear. Current market consensus on the dollar is that it is likely to weaken in the short term, in defiance of fundamentals. But Mr Avinash Persaud, head of currency research at JP Morgan (Europe), argues that 'the dollar is technically ripe for a large correction, were we to see co-ordinated and sustained central bank intervention.' He notes that a survey of clients, trading with 1-3 month time horizons, shows this segment of the market to be significantly short of dollars, for the first time in a year. Overall, says Mr Persaud, the market remains long of dollars, but it is the marginal investors who will determine a turn. Mr David Cocker, currency analyst at Chemical Bank, said the US currency 'would need very supportive comments from the Clinton administration to really turn the dollar around.' US comments so far had been too ambiguous to ease market nerves. The D-Mark was stronger in Europe, helped by the improved outlook for the German economy. The feature of European trading was the weakness of the Iberian currencies. The peseta finished in London at Pta81.84 from Pta81.46 on Friday against the D-Mark, while the escudo fell in tandem to close at Es103.1 from from Es103 . The catalyst for currency weakness was the escalating political scandal about the police chief, coming on top of an earlier embarrassment surrounding a former Bank of Spain governor, which caused a minister to resign and prime minister Felipe Gonzales to cancel an overseas visit. But political scandal comes against a background of nervous investors searching for security in European bond markets, which works against high-yielding economies such as Spain and Portugal. Ms Wendy Niffikeer, senior economist at IBJ International in London , said the scandal was 'an excuse for investors to sell the Iberian markets, because the inflation outlook was not as good as for some other European economies.' The Bundesbank will announce today the results of its weekly repo tender. Market estimates are for the central bank to allow the repo rate to fall by 5-12 basis points from 5.47 per cent currently. It dropped by 23 basis points over the past two weeks. But Ms Phyllis Reed, European bond strategist at BZW, believes the market is making the error of extrapolating from past trends. With the mid-point of German call money yesterday at about 5.55 per cent, above the repo rate of 5.47 per cent, she predicts a cut of only 2-3 basis points. In the futures market the June euromark contract closed at 94.89, down from 94.92. Sterling gave up most of its recent gains with the sterling index closing at 79.6 from its previous close of 80.3. The pound normally trades in tandem with the dollar, so the US currency's weakness is one explanation for sterling's decline. Political uncertainty is also weighing on the UK currency. Weekend press reports drew attention to the weak position of prime minister Mr John Major, and the market fears that heavy Tory losses in Thursday's local elections will aggravate matters further. In the futures market, short sterling lost ground as the likelihood of a further rate cut receded. Stronger than expected growth in April M0 was merely the latest in a string of data showing robust growth in the economy. The June contract closed at 94.59 from 94.62 on Friday. The longer contracts gave up more ground, with the December future finishing at 93.82 from 93.88. Conditions in the money market remained easy as the Bank of England removed a small Pounds 100m shortage. The guilder was unaffected by elections in the Netherlands, closing at Fl1.123 from Fl1.122. Investors also stood on the sideline in South Africa, awaiting clarity about the outcome of the election. The financial rand firmed to R4.6 against the dollar from R4.625.

On 15 May, THE  SUNDAY TIMES carried a special dispatch which said that Nelson  Mandela, who has just been elected president, will ""resign from  the post of president of South Africa within two years,"" and  that this would ""cause a power struggle within the African  National Congress."" The next morning, the BBC broadcast a  so-called documentary which had carefully pulled together  various pieces to claim that ""China has 10 million prisoners in  labor camps, who are in a hopeless situation."" When these rumors  came out, they were immediately refuted solemnly and forcefully  by Mandela himself and by a spokesman from our country's Foreign  Ministry.    On the same day THE SUNDAY TIMES carried its strange report,  Mandela issued a statement which said ""that the article is  totally groundless and is sheer rumor, its purpose is to create  instability in the first democratically elected government."" On  17 May, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman listed facts to  point out that the allegations by the BBC were ""sheer  fabrications.""    It is not a coincidence that these two British news agencies  one after the other resorted to this kind of trick to slander  South Africa and China; it is a natural revelation of the dark  side in the minds of a small minority of Britons who hate to see  advancement in the world. South Africa, which was once under  British colonial rule, has got rid of numerous obstacles, cast  off the chains of racism, obtained a new life, and embarked upon  a road of national reconciliation and peaceful and stable  development of the country; China, implementing the policy of  reform and opening up, enjoys economic prosperity, social  stability, and national unity, and is firmly fulfilling the  historic mission of resuming sovereignty over Hong Kong. Some  people in Britain do not want to see any of these things, but  they have no alternative, and although they have tried something  which overrates their strength, these moves resemble a mantis  trying to stop a chariot. Therefore, they have used disgraceful  means and did not hesitate to create materials and spread rumors  in an attempt to cheat the world and create trouble for the  countries to which they are hostile in order to find pretexts to  interfere in their internal affairs.    The BBC and THE SUNDAY TIMES always claim that they are  ""objective and just"" in their reporting. But facts prove that  they say something in one way and do something another way, and  even play a disgraceful role in fabricating rumors to mislead  people. Regarding this, I do not know what kind of explanation  they have to offer to the British public and international  public opinion circles.     "

House of Representatives member Nakamura was arrested on  suspicion of bribery after the lower house for the first time in  26 years approved a relevant petition filed by the Tokyo  District Court.    Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, who also heads the Japan  New Party, said the arrest of a legislator while the Diet was in  session is ""really regrettable,"" but did not elaborate.    Japanese legislators cannot be arrested during a Diet  session  without a go-ahead from parliament.    Liberal Democratic Party President Yohei Kono said ""as a  legislator"" he regretted ""that things have come so far."" Out of  respect for the Diet's ethical standards, legislators have to  make sure to clear themselves from any suspicion, he said.    Kono's party, which is at the center of the current  corruption scandal highlighting ties between the construction  industry and politicians, must make further efforts to ""break  with corruption,"" Kono said.    The Social Democratic Party (SDP), the largest force within  the ruling coalition, said the Diet's lifting of Nakamura's  immunity demonstrates parliament's determination to combat  political corruption.    SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo told a news conference his  party ""honors"" the Diet decision and urged the prosecution to  clarify suspicions against Nakamura as soon as possible.    Nakamura quit the main opposition LDP on Wednesday. He is  suspected of having accepted a 10 million yen bribe from Kajima  Corp., a leading construction firm.    Kozo Watanabe, acting secretary general of Shinseito (Japan  Renewal Party), another key coalition member, told reporters the  Diet's cooperation with prosecutors is important in restoring  public trust in politics.    ""We politicians must try to shape up so we can win back  public trust in politics,"" he said.    House of Representatives Speaker Takako Doi, while noting  the  need to honor parliamentarians' rights, said that legislators on  the other hand have the duty to safeguard the credibility of the  Diet.    Health and Welfare Minister Keizo Ouchi, leader of the minor  coalition Democratic Socialist Party, said it is ""really  regrettable"" that the construction bribery scandal has spread as  far as to an incumbent legislator.    He said that for the sake of public trust, the Diet had to  lift Nakamura's immunity.    Construction Minister Kozo Igarashi, of the SDP, said  Nakamura's arrest is ""extremely bitter"" for his ministry as it  has further undermined voter's trust.    Kazuo Shii, chief of the Secretariat of the minor opposition  Japanese Communist Party (JCP), said Nakamura's arrest is ""a  matter of course"" and his case only the tip of the iceberg.    He said his party will demand that Shinseito co-leader  Ichiro  Ozawa be questioned in connection with a series of bribery  scandals involving major contractors.    With bribes having been disbursed to win public works  contracts, Hosokawa and his government bear responsibility for  full clarification of the scandal, Shii said.     "

Arnaldo Ochoa Sanchez, who fought alongside Fidel Castro in  the revolution 30 years ago, was executed by firing squad at dawn Thursday  along with three other officers after being convicted in a $3-million  drug-smuggling and corruption scandal.    Their deaths, reported by the Cuban news agency AIN, came as no surprise to a  nation that for a month watched the progress of the trial on television.    The drug scandal has stunned and embarrassed Castro and his Communist  government, which for years denied U.S. accusations that Cuba was being used to  smuggle drugs into the United States.    Found guilty of treason and sentenced to death by firing squad by a  three-member military court last Friday were Ochoa; a former Interior Ministry  official, Col. Antonio de la Guardia; a secret police official, Maj. Amado  Padron, and Ochoa's military aide, Capt. Jorge Martinez.    ""Today at dawn a sentence dictated by a special military tribunal was carried  out against the accused,"" said Prensa Latina, identifying the four without  further comment in a dispatch from Havana.    The four former officers, who were arrested in June, were also found guilty of  drug trafficking and hostile acts toward foreign nations.    Last weekend, Cuba's Supreme Court and its Council of State, which is headed by  Castro, refused to overturn the sentences. The Cuban leader later declared that  even if he had the power he would not stop the executions.    They four were among 14 senior military and Interior Ministry officials  convicted by the tribunal of embezzlement and helping Colombia's notorious  Medellin drug cartel smuggle six tons of cocaine into the United States. They  were said to have accepted at least $3.4 million in bribes.      Smuggled Other Goods    The officers were also convicted of black marketeering and smuggling diamonds,  ivory, sugar, fine wools, manufactured goods and U.S. dollars.    All admitted guilt but asked for mercy based on their records and contrition.  The other 10 officers, including one woman, were sentenced to terms that ranged  from 10 to 30 years in prison.    Two Cabinet ministers also were fired in the crackdown.    The death sentences were carried out despite appeals for clemency from Pope  John Paul II, Amnesty International and other human rights organizations.    Ordinary life virtually came to a halt during televised proceedings that began  June 12. Cubans gathered around their sets in fascination not just at the drug  scandal but also because of the scenario of unbridled greed that unrolled.    The trial was shown nightly on national television. Cubans watched as Ochoa,  dressed in his general's uniform, with Cuba's highest decoration, Hero of the  Republic of Cuba, pinned to his jacket, said: ""One pays for treason with one's  life.""    For many Cubans, the trial was traumatic. The 57-year-old Ochoa was a  much-decorated and popular hero who most recently commanded the victorious  Cuban forces in Ethiopia during its war with Somalia that began in 1978 before  becoming chief of the Cuban military mission in Angola.

The four former officers, who were arrested in June, were also found guilty of  drug trafficking and hostile acts toward foreign nations.    Last weekend, Cuba's Supreme Court and its Council of State, which is headed by  Castro, refused to overturn the sentences. The Cuban leader later declared that  even if he had the power he would not stop the executions.    They four were among 14 senior military and Interior Ministry officials  convicted by the tribunal of embezzlement and helping Colombia's notorious  Medellin drug cartel smuggle six tons of cocaine into the United States. They  were said to have accepted at least $3.4 million in bribes.      Smuggled Other Goods    The officers were also convicted of black marketeering and smuggling diamonds,  ivory, sugar, fine wools, manufactured goods and U.S. dollars.    All admitted guilt but asked for mercy based on their records and contrition.  The other 10 officers, including one woman, were sentenced to terms that ranged  from 10 to 30 years in prison.    Two Cabinet ministers also were fired in the crackdown.    The death sentences were carried out despite appeals for clemency from Pope  John Paul II, Amnesty International and other human rights organizations.    Ordinary life virtually came to a halt during televised proceedings that began  June 12. Cubans gathered around their sets in fascination not just at the drug  scandal but also because of the scenario of unbridled greed that unrolled.    The trial was shown nightly on national television. Cubans watched as Ochoa,  dressed in his general's uniform, with Cuba's highest decoration, Hero of the  Republic of Cuba, pinned to his jacket, said: ""One pays for treason with one's  life.""    For many Cubans, the trial was traumatic. The 57-year-old Ochoa was a  much-decorated and popular hero who most recently commanded the victorious  Cuban forces in Ethiopia during its war with Somalia that began in 1978 before  becoming chief of the Cuban military mission in Angola.

The ruling Liberal Democratic Party is in disarray, unable to agree on an  untainted successor to assume the reins of government other than a party elder  who is 75 years old and ailing.    Powerful critics in the media are calling for the dissolution of the lower  house of Parliament. The public is outraged by a new 3% consumption tax imposed  by the ruling party, unilaterally and over vehement protest. Questions are  being raised about the government's capacity to conduct foreign policy. And  prosecutors are rumored to be preparing to indict several ruling party  politicians.    In most countries, the situation might provide opposition forces with an  excellent opportunity to make a grab for control of Parliament. But not in  Japan.    Despite diatribes against the ruling party's ""money-power politics,"" the  opposition is hopelessly divided on policy and ill-prepared to ride the wave of  the Recruit Co. influence-buying scandal into power. Posturing over the  prospects of a coalition government is simply not credible, analysts say.    Nor can the opposition accurately claim to have unseated Takeshita. The prime  minister faced unprecedented low popularity ratings -- 3.9% in a Kyodo News  Service poll published April 16 -- and was hounded in a media campaign with  disclosures that he and his aides received about $1.12 million in political  donations and stock profits from Recruit Co., an information services, computer  and real estate conglomerate.    ""Takeshita made a preemptive attack against the opposition by announcing he  would resign,"" said Seizaburo Sato, a professor of political science at Tokyo  University. ""It's clear that the opposition parties are in a less favorable  position now,"" Sato said.    ""I'm not saying they lost, but they wanted an election under Takeshita. They  would have had a much better chance to gain seats.""    The Liberal Democrats will pick a leader to replace Takeshita by the time the  fiscal 1989 budget formally passes Parliament, where the opposition is clinging  to a somewhat dubious strategy of boycotting deliberations while demanding  sworn testimony by former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone on his role in the  scandal.    The ruling party ignored the opposition boycott and rammed the budget through a  lower house committee this morning, in keeping with its goal of taking it to a  vote in a plenary session of the chamber by the end of the week. It was not  clear whether the opposition would attend the plenary session. The budget is  expected to be acted upon by the upper house, or go into effect automatically,  by the end of May.    Masayoshi Ito, one of the few party stalwarts who has not been accused of  accepting graft, is expected to get the nod as Takeshita's successor, even  though he is frail and suffering from diabetes, a chronic but not necessarily  life-threatening disease. According to the prevailing scenario, Ito would serve  as a caretaker dedicated to reforming political fund-raising practices while  guiding the party through an upper house election in the summer and a ballot  for the lower house that must also be held by next summer.    The cause of political reform received emotional impetus Wednesday when Ihei  Aoki, 58, the aide who handled Takeshita's finances, slit a wrist and hanged  himself with a necktie in his Tokyo apartment.    Aoki and one of Takeshita's relatives traded in unlisted shares of a Recruit  subsidiary along with more than 150 others in political, bureaucratic and  business circles, earning windfall profits that in some cases, prosecutors  allege, constituted bribes.    ""I strongly regret (his action),"" the Associated Press quoted Takeshita as  telling reporters. ""We walked side by side for over 30 years.""    Shigezo Hayasaka, a political commentator, said in a televised interview: ""We  should take advantage of this tragic incident to focus on the political  landscape where practicing politics costs too much money. People throughout  Japan should bring out their wisdom to truly reform the situation.""    Hayasaka was a friend of Aoki. He also was the personal secretary of Kakuei  Tanaka, Takeshita's former mentor and the last prime minister to be forced to  resign because of a fund-raising scandal.    Tanaka quit in 1974 and remained the most powerful figure in Japanese politics,  even after he was arrested in 1976 for receiving a bribe from Lockheed --  unrelated to the allegations that forced him to step down -- and convicted on  the charge in 1983. Tanaka withdrew from the political stage after a crippling  stroke in 1985, but he technically retains a seat in Parliament while his  appeal is pending.    Critics remain skeptical that the ruling party will attempt anything more than  cosmetic changes in the political system. As it stands, massive spending is  required to cultivate support in local constituencies, virtually dictating that  successful politicians must bend the nominal rules on fund-raising.      'A Scanty Effort'    ""The ruling party is talking about political reform, but if you examine the  substance of their plan, all you see is some talk about restricting the sale of  tickets to fund-raising parties -- it's a scanty effort,"" said Teiko Kihira,  vice chairwoman of the Japan League of Women's Voters.    ""Takeshita's resignation announcement doesn't do anything to resolve the  Recruit scandal,"" Kihira said. ""This has tainted nearly the entire leadership  of the Liberal Democratic Party, and even some of the opposition. It's  structural corruption, and it's not going to be rooted out by cutting off the  head.""    Meanwhile, the hue and cry from the media continues. The newspaper Asahi, which  broke the news of Recruit's ethically questionable stock transactions last  summer and has maintained a lead role in disclosing the company's staggering  program of political contributions, urged in an editorial Wednesday that the  next administration dissolve the lower house and face the verdict of voters.    ""The Recruit scandal revealed how rotten some politicians and those close to  the incumbent and former prime ministers are,"" Asahi said. ""This scandal will  remain as an indelible stain in the postwar history of Japanese politics.""    Takeshita's resignation ""is only the beginning of the cleansing of Japan's  rotten politics,"" the liberal newspaper said. ""It would not be strange if the  party is forced to turn over the helm of national politics to the opposition  parties.""    But an editorial in the conservative newspaper Yomiuri was more disparaging  about the opposition.    ""Although the support rate for the Takeshita Cabinet has plummeted to an  all-time low, few have expectations of the opposition parties assuming  political leadership,"" it said. ""These parties should take this as severe  public criticism. They are so divided over foreign and domestic policies that  the public will not support an opposition government at this time.""    Yet the major opposition parties -- excluding the Communists -- are keeping up  the appearances of solidarity. Last week, leaders of the Japan Socialist Party,  the Komeito or Clean Government Party, the Democratic Socialist Party and the  Social Democratic Federation met in Kyoto to map out strategy for a coalition.    But the opposition lacks enough seats to wield any formal leverage to force  dissolution or bring on a lower house election before the Liberal Democrats  want one. It can only appeal to public opinion and try to shame the ruling  party into submitting to an electoral test.    Meanwhile, little is being said about how the opposition parties would  reconcile their formidable differences on policy. The Socialists advocate  scrapping the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty and are friendly with North Korea, for  example, while the Democratic Socialist Party adheres to a generally  conservative ideology similar to the ruling party.    The public has expressed its displeasure in several recent local elections,  suggesting that the ruling party will have to contend with a protest vote when  half the seats in the less powerful upper house go up for grabs sometime in the  summer.

When Drasko  Markovic, deputy of the Serbian Radical Party [SRS], said  something concerning the reputation of Dr. Radovan Bozovic,  president of the Citizens Chamber of the Assembly of Yugoslavia  -- more accurately, when in proposing an item on the agenda he  mentioned Bozovic's involvement in the so-called ministerial  scandal (stealing on a large scale involving two ministers of  the Serbian Government, headed by Dr. Bozovic), which is still  dragging on in the courts -- the latter turned off the  microphone at the speaker's stand.    In the next scene, the president of the Citizens Chamber  gestured to the Radical deputy to leave the speaker's desk, and  the latter took a glass of mineral water (it must have been  ""Karadjordje!"") and spilled it on the president's desk, but not  so violently that it would splash the president of the Chamber.    Bozovic then obtained from the Chamber permission to eject  the deputy from the Chamber. (Up to now deputies have been  ejected without a vote.)    The chastised deputy first headed for the exit, and then, at  the suggestion of the party's leader, he sat on a bench. The  Radicals surrounded their colleague and did not allow the  Assembly security to eject Markovic from the Chamber. There  began a test of strength based on credentials--the Radicals  referred to immunity, and the security personnel referred to the  official order of the president of the Chamber. One security  officer shouted: ""Mr. Deputy, allow me to discharge my duty!""  Seselj answered: ""You are not going to discharge your duty!""    In the fistfight that ensued, Radical Deputy Filip  Stojanovic  got a bloody ear. Seselj shouted in a strong voice: ""You have  drawn the man's blood, damn your communist mother. To hell with  Sloba Milosevic!"" He advised his deputy to display his bloody  handkerchief, and then, raising the temperature, he said that  ""half a liter of blood has been shed""; throughout the entire  Chamber, he called to Radmilo Bogdanovic, chairman of the  Security Committee: ""Radmilo, see what your police are doing!""  The latter, after sending a long and significant look in  Seselj's direction, left the Chamber!    When passions cooled, the Radicals left the session, and the  next day (Thursday, 19 May) they did not attend the debate  concerning the new rules of the Assembly, when everyone was  talking about the ""dignity of the Assembly.""    Incidentally, on two occasions before this incident Bozovic  has left the session when Dr. Vojislav Seselj mentioned his  involvement in criminal scandals. Exactly a year ago, an  incident occurred in which Bozovic took the opposite tack. When  Radical Deputy Vakic dealt a knockout blow to Deputy Mihajlo  Markovic, Bozovic reacted in a manner well-disposed to Vakic.

0,FT944-9965 ,"FT944-9965 _AN-EKMASAEUFT 941112   FT  12 NOV 94 / Food  Drink: Why antifreeze worked wonders      By JANCIS ROBINSON   What German wine needs is a real humdinger of a scandal - widespread addition of antifreeze perhaps - and the will to take it seriously. The diethylene glycol debacle has certainly worked wonders for Austrian wine. Nearly 10 years on, with fundamentally revised legislation and painstaking quality control systems, the Austrian wine industry is so freshly scrubbed and cloaked in virtue it is almost blindingly bright, while the German wine business is stil shrouded in the grey mists of compromise and rampant commercialism. Fastidious American importers such as Vin DiVino, of Chicago, and Terry Theise, of Milton S Kronheim  Co, Washington DC, are fighting over Austria's top wine producers, blasting their customers with phrases such as: 'I gotta warn you: prepare to be surprised, 'cause you ain't never tasted stuff like dis.' The British wine trade is proceeding rather more sedately, as is its wont. If it does not act soon it will find that the Americans, the Germans and even the Japanese (who import almost as much Austrian wine as the British) will have snapped up all the top wines. Austria suffers from the reverse problem to, say, Chile. It has ample evidence of producing some of the world's finest wines: dry Rieslings, from the Wachau and (often better value) neighbouring Kremstal and Kamptal; Styrian varietals of Collio-like purity; and the most luscious botrytised sweet wines from Burgenland. What it does not have is an ocean of seriously cheap plonk to lap at the shores of the supermarkets  - except for an extraordinary new product called Servus. Very much designed, to sell at about Pounds 3 a bottle on British high streets, it is an attempt by the new governor of Burgenland to shape some of his state's surplus supply of basic white into something that will sustain commercially viable viticulture in Burgenland, and tempt new wine drinkers to try Austria. Producer Lenz Moser, one of the few big merchants to have survived the scandal, is gambling on its success, marketing it defiantly in a clear bordeaux bottle. It tastes crisp and unobjectionable - if undistinguished. The economy and geography of Austria, however, are probably best suited to titillating connoisseurs. British wine drinkers prepared to spend Pounds 7 to Pounds 40 a bottle can find proof of Austria's uniquely dedicated new generation of wine producers at the addresses listed below. The parallel between Austrian and German wine is obvious, not just because the label language and many of the grape varieties grown are the same, but because the German wine industry today faces many of the same problems faced by its Austrian counterpart in the early 1980s just before the glycol scandal enforced a clean sweep. Large commercial bottlers have forced Germany's grape prices down to such an extent that German wines, which were prized above classed- growth bordeaux at the turn of the century, are viewed by many as the lowest of the vinous low. We enthusiasts continue to wave a flag for the quality-conscious producing elite, but the country's reputation continues to be damaged by the lax controls on what officially constitutes 'quality wine' (about 95 per cent of production). In fact the so-called anti-freeze scandal of 1985 reflected just as badly on Germany as Austria. This harmless additive was used exclusively by a limited number of Austrian merchants (not growers) to add body to sweet Austrian wine and was subsequently found in many bottles of supposedly 'German' wine. But the questions raised by this were never properly answered. The Germans had a chance last year to reform their wine laws and they blew it. Enormously high yields are still permitted, and there was no radical reform of the complicated and often misleading nomenclature or the minimum ripeness levels required for each category. It is left to the better producers, such as (but by no means exclusively) those who belong to the VDP group, to impose their own higher standards. For the moment, the consumer is left at the end of the queue - but the future is bleak for any wine producer which ignores the consumer in today's market. Some Austrian importers: Adnams, of Southwold, Suffolk and T  W Wines, of Thetford, Norfolk (0842-765646) for Willy Opitz' crazy half-bottlings; Noel Young, of Trumpington, Cambridgeshire (0223-844744) for Kracher sweet wines and Pockl reds; Richard Nurick, of Pangbourne, Berkshire (0734-842565) for Stiegelmar and Sonnhof; Lay  Wheeler of Colchester, Essex, for some fine Styrian and Burgenland bottles; Richard Spiers Wines, of Guildford, Surrey (0483-37605) for a small Kremstal and Burgunland selection; Forth Wines of Milnathort, central Scotland (0577-862513) for some of Lenz Moser's estate bottlings; The Wine Treasury of London SW6 (071-371 7131) for Skoff's Styrians; The Grape Shop of London SW11 (071-924 3638) for Kolbl, Bauer and Prechtl wines; and Penistone Court Wine Cellars, of Sheffield (0226-766037).

0,FT933-12911 ,"FT933-12911 _AN-DGVCBABDFT 930722   FT  22 JUL 93 / Kenyans close bank in bid to placate donors      By LESLIE CRAWFORD      NAIROBI   THE KENYAN government has closed down a scandal-tainted local bank, an important step towards mending relations with the World Bank and other donors. Exchange Bank and its sister trading company Goldenberg International were at the centre of a scandal based on 'ghost exports' of gold and diamond jewellery to Switzerland and Dubai. By forging export receipts for more than Dollars 50m (Pounds 33.3m) worth of jewellery, Exchange Bank was able to bid for scarce foreign exchange at central bank auctions and obtain a 35 per cent refund from the government on its fictitious exports. When Exchange Bank ran into trouble in May the Central Bank of Kenya bailed it out with an advance of Ks15bn (Pounds 128m) in short-term Treasury bills. To date there is no evidence that this has been repaid. The scandal was one of the big issues worrying the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. IMF officials, who have visited Kenya four times in as many months, had insisted that action be taken to clean up the financial system as a pre-condition for resumption of balance of payments assistance, suspended in November 1991. On Monday a short statement signed by Mr Musalia Mudavadi, finance minister, said Exchange Bank was being closed immediately following the results of an external audit into its operations. 'Its records are not in order and not kept up to date. Moreover, there is evidence of malpractice,' Mr Mudavadi's statement said. 'Its management has tended to engage in speculative activities which are not only inconsistent with established banking practices but are prejudicial to the interests of depositors and the general public.' Four other financial institutions, dubbed 'political banks' due to the patronage they enjoy from high-ranking members of government, are also being subjected to external audits at the request of the IMF. The opposition FORD-Kenya party, which has led a campaign to expose the activities of the 'political banks', yesterday welcomed Mr Mudavadi's decision. 'Exchange Bank, along with a handful of other banks, threatened the fabric of Kenya's financial and economic infrastructure and are a major cause of our inflation problems,' said Mr Robert Shaw, FORD-Kenya's economic spokesman. Mr Shaw urged the government to arrest and charge the owners and directors of the bank with economic sabotage. He said government and central bank officials who aided Exchange Bank in its operations should be dismissed and prosecuted. Mr Mudavadi, who took over the finance portfolio in January, has won the respect of foreign bankers in Nairobi for his efforts to clean up the banking system. Financial corruption lies at the heart of the political patronage enjoyed by leading members of President Daniel arap Moi's government, but foreign bankers question whether Mr Mudavadi has sufficient clout within government to force the sacking of corrupt officials. Vice-President George Saitoti, the former finance minister, who is also minister for planning and development, last month defended the operations of Exchange Bank in parliament, saying he had approved them in compliance with the law.

At Jan Smuts airport near Johannesburg, Shumeyko made the  following statement:    ""A solemn and joyful event in the life of South Africa --  the  inauguration of the first democratically elected president of  the country -- has brought this Russian delegation to South  Africa.    ""As is known, Russia has made a weighty contribution to the  cause of dismantling apartheid and ensuring a political  settlement in the RSA. In the fight against the system of  apartheid and in the process of establishing a negotiating  process, we developed close friendly relations with the  constructive forces in South Africa, which are now widely  represented in the leadership of South Africa. We intend to  maintain and strengthen these relations.    ""The RSA and Russia are experiencing a similar period of  renewal, a period of seeking the ways of future development  while overcoming the old mentality and difficulties of adapting  to the new realities. Who, therefore, is better qualified than  we are to better understand each other's problems and mutually  make use of the accumulated positive experience of social  reformation.""    The similarity of approach to many aspects of world politics  paves the way to partnership in international relations. Russia  maintains that the new South Africa must enter the world  community and its international bodies as an equal participant,  and that all remaining sanctions against it should be lifted  without delay. We are prepared to help South Africa in this  matter.    The delegation also brought a personal message from  President  Boris Yeltsin to President Nelson Mandela, congratulating him  and stating that the Russian leadership and all Russia's  citizens are ready to further promote bilateral cooperation with  the RSA in all areas, which would benefit both democratic Russia  and South Africa in the name of peace and prosperity.""    In an ITAR-TASS interview, Vladimir Shumeyko stressed that  the RSA used to be associated mainly with apartheid. Now when  the democratic processes have begun in that country, just as  they have been in Russia, the whole world wishes it success on  this path.    Speaking of bilateral relations, the head of the Russian  Federation delegation said they are not beginning from scratch.  Since the sanctions against the RSA were lifted, many  cooperation opportunities in various fields have opened up  between the two countries that are building democracy.  Interparliamentary relations are of considerable importance.  Our countries have similar legislature in the economic sphere,  and this makes our contacts much easier. We hope that from the  outset we will start moving toward legislation that will take  into account the interests of each partner.     "
0,FT934-7281 ,"FT934-7281 _AN-DKUAIABTFT 931120   FT  20 NOV 93 / Man in the news: Act of faith on history's stage - F W de Klerk      By PATTI WALDMEIR   History draws a fine line between the visionary leader and the dreamer: both have visions, but only one succeeds in making his dreams come true. Mr F W de Klerk of South Africa may this week have made the fatal mistake which separates the one from the other, when he decided - against all the odds and against the principles which he had so long espoused - to hand over white power and accept majority rule. It was one of the more extraordinary reversals in the history of nations, which provides few examples of men who abdicate power without being forced to do so. And it was certainly never Mr de Klerk's intention: not when he acted on his initial vision of a peaceful multiracial South Africa, and released Mr Nelson Mandela from prison nearly four years ago; and not when, during the violence and anarchy that have followed, he refused better deals than the one he has now accepted. The deal he has signed will give him a place in a multiparty government of national unity, and an unenforceable commitment from Mr Nelson Mandela, likely to be the next president, that his views will not be ignored in cabinet. But Mr Mandela let there be no mistake about his intentions: he will try to obtain Mr de Klerk's assent for government action; but where he cannot, he will proceed nonetheless. The majority will rule, and the minority will have no constitutional power to stop it. Power will be shared, but only so long as it suits Mr Mandela to share it. Government spokesman Dave Steward speaks of the 'deep underlying symbiotic relationship' which underpins power-sharing; but it is hard to see that happy relationship surviving long under the strains of cohabitation. Yet Mr de Klerk did not set out to bargain away white power: his supporters did not elect him to do so; those who voted resoundingly for him in last year's white referendum were promised a different outcome. He set out, ironically, to avoid the fate of the white minority regime in Rhodesia, which waited to negotiate until it had fallen from strength, and was left with an ineffectual 20-seat bloc in a 100-seat national assembly, under black majority rule. The plan was for the South African government - which had never lost a liberation war and had successfully crushed dissent before opening negotiations - to negotiate from strength to guarantee the best future deal for whites. This was supposed to include entrenched powers for minority parties in cabinet, including what amounted to a veto for Mr de Klerk's National party on important issues; and autonomy for regional governments, to provide a check on central government power. Until recently, the National party was not interested in the argument that conventions of multiracial power-sharing would develop over time; it argued that whites' fear of majority rule would make them reject a constitution which embodied it. All that has changed: government negotiators insist the constitution lays the basis for a 'convention' of power-sharing, and that Mr Mandela has accepted a gentleman's agreement to respect it. But minorities have neither a veto in cabinet, nor any blocking power; they could walk out of cabinet, but this would not bring down the government. Moreover, the constitution fails to entrench powerful regional government, which was another National party demand. It is a measure of Mr de Klerk's image as a shrewd politician who skilfully fights his corner that many observers assume not that the president has conceded defeat, but that he has a trick up his sleeve which will deliver real power into his hands in the end. That may yet be true: for Mr de Klerk seems genuinely to believe the ANC cannot - and will not try - to rule without the National party. He is gambling on the fact that his party's power in fact will far exceed that in law. That power, say government negotiators, is based on the party's strength in the civil service and security forces (packed with Afrikaners since 1948), the economic clout of whites, the favour of the international community (which Mr de Klerk sees as his ally) and the votes of the National party electorate. His negotiators now argue (albeit belatedly) that constitutional guarantees are worth nothing unless the party proves it is indispensable to the country's new rulers: that restoring stability, the ANC's chief short-term goal, cannot be achieved without security force co-operation, which only the National party can deliver. But Mr de Klerk does not intend simply to play the role of what political analyst Steven Friedman, director of the Centre for Policy Studies, calls 'gate keeper to white confidence'. Mr de Klerk believes a 'silent majority' of black, coloured and Indian voters will flock to the NP from the ANC - whether in response to spiralling violence, or because coloureds and Indians will reject the ANC as an African party, or because other Africans fear the prominence of the Xhosa tribe in the ANC leadership. Only next year's election will tell whether Mr de Klerk imagines votes where they do not exist, and sees powerful backers where none are present. Recent opinion polls have given the NP 11 to 13 per cent of the national vote, and though this is almost certainly understated, the constitution agreed this week will do little to bolster his white support. Dissent over the constitution could yet split the party, with hardline ministers furious at the deal. Mr de Klerk's act of faith in his electoral support may pay off. If it does, it will indeed guarantee his party, and the Afrikaner nation which he set out to protect, a more secure long-term future than the minimum entrenched powers available from the ANC. But the risks are enormous. If he is wrong, Mr de Klerk could end up forfeiting all effective minority power, and being branded a traitor by his own people (many of whom already name him so). It would be a tragic irony if the man who had the courage to end apartheid should do no more than exchange one form of racial domination for another, and be forced off the stage of history at what ought to have been his greatest hour.

The ruler of the region's eight million Zulus was addressing  Mr de Klerk, Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] Leader Mangosuthu  Buthelezi and African National Congress President Nelson Mandela  during their summit meeting at Skukuza in the Kruger National  Park on Friday [8 April].    The king accused Mr de Klerk of ignoring the ""hideous and  despicable crime"" when eight IFP members were shot dead and at  least four injured on March 28 outside the Shell House  headquarters of the African National Congress in Plein Street,  Johannesburg.    Referring to a reported agreement between ANC leader Nelson  Mandela and the police, in which the police agreed not to enter  Shell House on condition that weapons inside the building were  handed over to them, the king said: ""You saw them being  ambushed, attacked and massacred... yet your police did not  enter Shell House to arrest the perpetrators and to secure  incriminating evidence.""    King Goodwill said it was clear that meetings he had held  with Mr de Klerk had not been ""fruitful"" and ""we have reached  the end of the road which we together opened on January 17,  1994"".    He said it was obvious that the only way in which Zulus  would restore their kingdom was ""through our own efforts as  Zulus and as freedom fighters"".    Mr de Klerk was still defending a unitary state which gave  no  recognition for the separateness of the Zulu kingdom and nation,  he said. The Zulu nation had endeavoured to seek a peaceful and  negotiated solution, but any possible freedom in the territory  had been abolished by the ""invasion"" of the SADF [South African  Defense Force] and SA Police to enforce the state of emergency  in kwaZulu/Natal.    ""I came (to the summit) because I felt it is my obligation  to  walk the extra mile in an effort to seek a solution to our  problems.    ""However, I feel that you, Mr President, and I have  discussed  all that there is to discuss and that the time for discussion  has somehow run its course. I always feel that deeds speak  louder than words,"" the king said.    He said the restoration of the kingdom of kwaZulu had to be  resolved before an election was held in South Africa. ""I am not  sure how we can make progress and in which direction. I know  that I am not prepared to go over again matters which you and I  have discussed at great length,"" he said.    The Zulu king said the key to successful negotiations was  whether the other leaders were prepared to listen to Zulu  aspirations, or whether, ""like those who conquered us, you think  you must trample with your feet on those just aspirations of my  nation"".

0,FT932-13495 ,"FT932-13495 _AN-DDWC9AA2FT 930423   FT  23 APR 93 / BNL in Atlanta funded arms for Iran: Documents reveal more secret loans from scandal-hit branch of Italian bank      By ALAN FRIEDMAN      NEW YORK   THE Atlanta branch of Italy's state-owned Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL) - already embroiled in scandal over Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.2bn) of loans that helped fund Iraq's war machine - also provided secret loans to finance arms sales to Iran. Italian government documents obtained by the Financial Times show that BNL Atlanta made Dollars 2bn of loans to countries including Iran, the former Soviet Union, Turkey and Jordan. Like the clandestine Iraqi loans, a large number of these additional loans were made without any formal notification to BNL's head office in Rome. Some of the money was used to help finance shipments of militarily useful equipment from US and European companies to Tehran, according to a US government official familiar with the case. Some of the shipments would have violated the United Nations ban on arms sales to Iran and Iraq during their 1980-1988 war. The additional loans, made in the mid- and late-1980s, extend the scope of the BNL scandal well beyond the bank's Atlanta branch and the issue of the Iraqi loans. Earlier this week it emerged that US investigators are also looking at BNL's Argentine operations to see if any of its funds in Buenos Aires were used to help finance Iraq's Condor 2 nuclear-capable missile project. BNL has said it is unaware of any links between its Argentine branch and companies that worked on the Condor 2 missile project. Last night the bank said it was unaware of the loans to Iran from Atlanta. However, a senior BNL executive said yesterday that at the time of the FBI raid on BNL's Atlanta branch on August 4 1989, a total of Dollars 735m of exposure resulting from non-Iraqi loans was discovered, of which Dollars 417m was US government guaranteed. He said he could not rule out that other non-Iraqi loans had been made by the Atlanta branch and already repaid by the time of the raid. In Venice, meanwhile, an Italian state prosecutor investigating the BNL affair has asked a court to convict and jail Mr Nerio Nesi and Mr Giacomo Pedde, the former BNL chairman and director-general, for allegedly illegal BNL-funded arms sales to Iran. These were unrelated to the Atlanta loans and were financed from Italy during the 1980s. Mr Felice Casson, the prosecuting magistrate, has also alleged that Italian intelligence agents were involved in the BNL-funded arms transactions. Both Mr Nesi and Mr Pedde have pleaded not guilty in the Venice trial, which has been under way for several weeks. It was also learned yesterday that a team of US prosecutors from Atlanta is planning to travel to Rome next month in order to question several BNL executives. This would mark the first time that Atlanta investigators have gone to Rome and comes three months after the US Federal Reserve re-opened its investigation of the BNL affair by sending officials from Washington and New York to Rome.

They aim to put European Union [EU] trading nations firmly  in  the front line in the threecornered fight between Europe, the  United States and the Far East over access to the resources-rich  nation.    The EU delegation will be made up of representatives from  several major directorates-general and will be in South Africa  from 27 June to 2 July. Trade, investment and tariffs are to be  discussed in depth as part of a comprehensive package earlier  agreed by the Council of Ministers.    Britain's trade and economics group, which will be at least  60-strong, will be headed by board of trade president Michael  Heseltine and is believed to be one of the largest delegations  to leave the UK this year.    During the visit -- from 10 to 15 July -- the British group  will meet business people and politician; in Johannesburg,  Durban and Cape Town. Britain has already pledged a $150  million loan the largest amount from any European country.    The EU delegation will arrive in Cape Town for talks with  Trevor Manuel, South Africa's minister for trade and industry  and other senior ministers, before going on to Pretoria and  Johannesburg. Apart from wider issues, the talks are crucial  because South Africa's status as a trading partner and as a  suitable investment prospect has to be clarified.    If firm future trade links are to be set up, a bilateral  agreement between Brussels and Pretoria is seen as a matter of  urgency. So far, the EU has left it to member states to enter  into investment protection, double taxation and bilateral trade  agreements with South Africa, but has now accelerated the pace  at which it feels agreement must be reached with South Africa in  the face of American initiatives.    With the total U.S. commitment of $420m in loans towards  economic and social regeneration in South Africa both from  public and private sectors, the pledges of $179m this year from  the EU and member countries apart from the UK may look small in  comparison. However, EU contributions will be grants, without  strings attached.    In April, the EU foreign affairs council finalised its  policy  on a joint trade and aid measures programme and following the  South African elections, this is a priority issue on the  delegation menu.    The visit is seen as the first of a two-phase thrust to  establish future relations. The second phase will begin with a  conference in the EU with delegates from all southern African  countries. Mandela has already agreed in principle to the  creation of a Southern African Economic Community and this will  be actively pursued.    The EU wants to prepare the way for other areas of  cooperation in education and training, industry and commerce,  telecommunications science and technology.     "

The project went  ahead despite warnings that one would be looking for trouble if  one took people with different backgrounds and threw them  together for a quick training exercise."" ""The project costed  the country millions. The old defense force gave 34 million rand  from its budget to the peacekeeping force.

For some bizarre reason, the prime minister, who, under  normal circumstances, would be considered the nation's top  law-enforcement official, has decided to adopt a ""hands-off""  policy in the scandal involving 45 tonnes of Thai marijuana  shipped from either Thailand or nearby countries to the United  States between 1973 and 1987 allegedly involving an opposition  lawmaker from Nakhon Panom province.    Strange, incredible and incoherent statements were made by  all concerned from the very first day this story broke into the  open here about two weeks ago. Nobody should have been taken  aback of course when MP Thanong Siriprichaphong denied it all.  That he backtracked somewhat to admit some of the claims made  by the U.S. Information Service was only to be expected.    It should have come as no surprise, either, that some of the  leading members of Chat Thai Party came out vehemently to raise  the specter of a concerted conspiracy to discredit the major  opposition party. And the allegation may well be valid to a  certain extent. If the timing of the ""leak"" was suspect, the  drug-trafficking episode was a clear case of violation of the  law--American and Thai.    But the government has mishandled the scandal from the  outset. The USIS statement made it very clear that the first  official word of the indictment against this group of Thais was  relayed to the Thai government in January, 1993. Fifteen months  later, Government House, the Foreign Ministry and the Office of  Narcotics Control Board said they had no clues about the case at  all. Suddenly, the government itself was trapped by its attempt  to detach itself from a potentially sensitive issue. Prime  Minister Chuan Likphai's initial reaction to reporters'  questions was one of typical caution and detachment. It was him  all over again, warning against rushing to conclusions and  allowing the accused to state his case.    Likewise, Thai police were tonguetied. The Foreign Ministry,  presumably the only official channel through which the U.S.  Embassy had informed the Thai government about the indictment,  failed miserably to explain why it had kept quiet for so long.  The country's top drug enforcement agency under the  jurisdiction of the Prime Minister's Office, was caught  offguard, mumbling something bordering on disbelief. Its  earlier claims about close contacts with Washington's DEA in  cracking down on drug traffickers suddenly faded into oblivion.    While Thanong put on his flip-flop show, his Chat Thai Party  went through its defensive motion. Banhan Sinlapa-acha, the new  party boss, has every reason to believe that the whole exercise  was part of a well-orchestrated conspiracy against his political  career path. The leak came on the eve of his being elevated to  the post as party leader--one year and four months after the  Thai Foreign Ministry was supposed to have been tipped about the  court case in San Francisco.    That was probably why Premier Chuan quickly turned the case  into Chat Thai's very own in-house hot potato instead of  demanding a full-fledged investigation into DEA's claim, whether  or not the key suspect was a prominent politician in the  opposition camp. One wonders whether the government would have  treated this case with the same nonchalance had the same charge  been slapped on a lawmaker on the side of the government.    The House of Representatives may have named a committee to  look into the charges. The Chat Thai Party, too, has set up its  own probe team, ostensibly to demonstrate its seriousness in  salvaging its reputation.    But the government has yet to come up with any convincing  move to underscore the fact that drug trafficking allegations  are far from a partisan issue best left to political parties  concerned. It's a national problem which affects the overall  social and economic fabric--and the government's political  credibility in living up to its platform to crack down hard on  drugs and illicit drugs.    Prime Minister Chuan will have to get his people to answer  some of the obvious questions which have been raised in this  connection:    1. The DEA said it had submitted a official letter on  Thanong's case in January, 1993. Who in which government agency  was the recipient of the document? Why has the report been kept  under wraps all along? Why weren't the prime minister, the  foreign minister, the interior minister and the anti-narcotics  agency informed about the request?    2. If the relevant agencies were in fact informed about the  case, why did they insist, on the day the story broke, that they  were not aware of the incident? If they, in fact, had been told  about the story but were not ready to give out the truth to the  public, were they therefore lying to the people? Who were they  trying to protect? What has happened to accountability of  public servants in this country?    3. Do the law-enforcement agencies plan to take their own  action, under Thai laws, against those accused by the American  authorities? Are we, members of the Thai public, being told to  believe that the various shipments of marijuana destined for the  United States were in no way related to Thailand--and that they  did not constitute offenses under the Thai laws at all?    4. Does the five-party coalition government stand ready to  be accused of politicizing the scandal to save itself from a  no-confidence motion--and, in the process, undermining Chat Thai  leader Banhan's attempts to grill the government?    In other words, can the government get away with its  apparent  inefficiency and obvious lack of accountability while the  opposition tries to can this kettle of fish? The answer, plain  and simple, is no.     "

Criminal charges, however, will not be filed against the firm, although criminal investigations of individuals and other firms involved in the Salomon case continue. In an additional penalty against Salomon, the firm was suspended for 60 days from engaging in transactions with the New York Federal Reserve. The New York Fed said it would resume trading with Salomon on August 3, when its previous ban on the firm bidding in Treasury auctions for customers - imposed immediately after the scandal broke last August - will also be lifted. The suspensions, however, do not affect Salomon's status as a primary dealer in government securities with the Fed, which it retains. After yesterday's settlements were announced, Salomon said that it would take a pre-tax charge of Dollars 185m in the second quarter of this year, which, with the Dollars 200m set aside last year, will go towards covering the cost of the penalties and legal costs related to the roughly 50 private lawsuits that have been filed against the firm in the wake of the bond trading scandal. The Dollars 290m settlement ends a 10-month joint investigation launched by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Federal Reserve and the Justice Department in August 1991, when federal authorities discovered that members of Salomon's bond trading desk had faked customer orders and bid beyond government limits in Treasury auctions. The SEC also said yesterday that during the investigation it was discovered that in August 1989 another primary dealing firm secretly bid for Dollars 3.5bn in government securities on Salomon's behalf by concealing the real identity of the bidder in its records of the transaction. Officials at the SEC declined to identify the primary dealer involved. There was no comment on what action might be taken in light of the discovery. Of the money Salomon has agreed to pay for its actions, Dollars 190m represents fines and forfeitures for violating US securities laws, and Dollars 100m will be placed in a fund to compensate victims of the violations. The settlement, however, does not affect the private lawsuits filed against Salomon by clients and individuals who claim they suffered losses because of the firm's activities. The penalties imposed on Salomon yesterday were generally regarded by analysts as sizeable but not threatening to the firm's survival. The news was certainly well-received on Wall Street, with Salomon shares jumping Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 33 1/2 .  The Financial Times   London Page 28  "
0,FT944-14850 ,"FT944-14850 _AN-EJUCOAAVFT 941021   FT  21 OCT 94 / Hualon is a 'victim of hearsay': Laura Tyson interviews chief of Taiwanese textile company linked to share controversy      By LAURA TYSON   Hualon-Teijran, the Taiwanese textile manufacturer, is determined to proceed with plans to build a plant in Northern Ireland with financial help from the British government, despite the recent share payment default controversy to which the company has been linked. Mr Liang Ching-hsiung, president of the Taiwan-listed company, in an interview depicted Hualon-Teijran as having fallen 'victim to hearsay' in this and previous scandals that have plagued its founding Oung family, maverick scions of a Shanghai textile dynasty. Mr Liang sought to distance the company he runs from other companies associated with Mr Oung Ta-ming, the focus of attention in the share scandal earlier this month involving 28 securities firms and TDollars 7.6bn (Pounds 182m) in defaults. He also sought to dispel concerns that Hualon-Teijran's Pounds 157m investment project near Belfast, undertaken with Pounds 61m in UK government aid, would go the way of an earlier state-subsidised project in Northern Ireland, the De-Lorean car factory, which collapsed in the early 1980s. 'Hualon has always been a solid, dedicated manufacturing operation, not a speculative company,' Mr Liang said. 'I particularly want to emphasise that our company has no relations whatsoever with Oung Ta-ming or his securities businesses and we know absolutely nothing about his share trading activities. In fact, all we know is what we read in the newspapers, like everyone else.' Mr Oung, a Taiwanese legislator and prominent share speculator, founded and built up a loosely knit group of companies now reckoned to be Taiwan's tenth biggest industrial group. Control is split among Mr Oung and three younger brothers. Mr Liang, who has worked at Hualon-Teijran since 1968, described the history and structure of the group in an effort to clarify what he regarded as misconceptions about the management of and relationship among companies within the group. He also presented Hualon-Teijran's version of events preceding a 1991 share-bribery scandal which led to the downfall of a cabinet minister. Mr Oung You-ming, the third Oung brother and chairman of Hualon-Teijran, left Taiwan after the scandal broke and has not returned to face charges in connection with the case. He now runs Hualon's businesses in Malaysia. Mr Liang said the case was politicised and Mr Oung You-ming will ultimately be found innocent. 'When the timing is right, Oung You-ming will of course return to Taiwan, but at the moment he has no concrete plans to do so.' Unlike other Taiwanese family run conglomerates such as Formosa Plastics and Koo's Group, the Oung family companies do not have a central holding company or centralised management and finances, Mr Liang said. Thus the term 'Hualon group' is actually a misnomer as the various entities have always been run independently, despite the fact that until the late 1980s family members sometimes held positions in more than one company. Mr Liang said that 1989 'marked a very important milestone for the family and for the businesses. At that point, Oung Ta-ming went into semi-retirement. He no longer wanted to have anything to do with the manufacturing side, so he let his brothers take over those businesses.' When Mr Oung You-ming took over Hualon-Teijran he began to look for opportunities to expand overseas and diversify. In 1990 the Taiwan government began offering financial incentives for investment in high-technology industries. Mr Liang said the younger Mr Oung wanted to take advantage of those incentives, but by law the consolidated investments of a listed company could not exceed 40 per cent of total registered capital. (This restriction was lifted in 1991.) To comply, Hualon-Teijran decided to sell 5m shares in Kuo Hwa Life Insurance. As Kuo Hwa is an unlisted concern, bidders could not be solicited publicly. Mr Oung tried to sell the shares privately to other tycoons, but none was interested given that the stock exchange index's fall from 12,000 in February 1990 to around 3,000 in October. The shares were sold in December 1990 to the daughter of Mr Clement Chang, minister of transportation and communications at the time, for TDollars 120 a share, compared with Mr Oung's original asking price of TDollars 150 a share. The shares were estimated by accountants to have a net asset value of TDollars 80. Regulators were notified of the transaction and a public announcement was made, as required by law. Authorities made no objection to the sale, Mr Liang said. 'We were trying our best as a law-abiding company to abide by the law of the country,' he said. In February 1991 Mr Hsu Rong-chi, a self-styled expert on the insurance industry, filed a suit against the sale, claiming that the shares were worth TDollars 500-TDollars 800 each, Mr Liang said. (Through his underground radio station, Mr Hsu this year mobilised Taipei cab drivers on several occasions to pro test against the ruling party. He was convicted last month of using the airwaves to incite violent demonstrations and sentenced to eight months in jail.) Mr Oung was temporarily prevented from leaving the country by prosecutors, but the restriction was lifted later. He subsequently left Taiwan legally and did not 'skip bail' as is widely believed, Mr Liang said. Hualon-Teijran's shares are widely dispersed among 180,000 shareholders. Mr Oung You-ming holds 3 per cent and Kuo Hwa Life Insurance 8 per cent. The company forecasts pre-tax profits of TDollars 1.15bn on turnover of TDollars 27bn in 1994, against a loss of TDollars 384m in 1993.   Companies:-  Hualon-Teijran.

0,FT932-14430 ,"FT932-14430 _AN-DDSCSADEFT 930419   FT  19 APR 93 / Leading Article: The centre holds   THE FUNERAL today of Mr Chris Hani, the assassinated African National Congress leader, is as momentous an event as any in the country's history. When Mr Nelson Mandela walked to freedom, millions of black South Africans welcomed an icon who had come to life. Three violent years later, they are mourning a man they see as a martyr, and celebration has turned to frustration and bitterness, anger and sorrow. These are times fraught with danger: extremists have drawn blood, black township youth are impatient for change, and the ANC's mass action campaign for early elections will inevitably raise the temperature. So far, however, the political centre holds. Some 28 deaths since the assassination are known to have been politically related. It is 28 deaths too many; but well below the weekly average this year. Last Thursday's tragedy in Soweto, when four demonstrators were killed and hundreds injured by police fire, illustrated again that the security forces' first instinct is to shoot, often without provocation. But on a day when more than 1m protesters took to the streets, tragedy could have become catastrophe were it not for the marchers' restraint, the presence of ANC marshalls, and the moderating role of the country's political leaders. Mr Mandela has been at his best, striking the right note in a television address to the nation last Wednesday as important for its symbolism as its substance. It not only confirmed his elder statesman status that, for a while at least, transcended his party loyalty; it was recognition of the reality that underlies the negotiating process: white South Africa can no longer govern on its own. For his part, President F W de Klerk has been treading a tightrope, resisting calls for a crackdown and countrywide state of emergency from the right, but reinforcing security where needed. And Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, leader of the Inkatha Freedom Party, accompanied his tribute to Mr Hani with an appeal for calm. What above all may have kept black anger in check, however, is the progress apparently made at the negotiating table. The expectation that the talks, due to resume soon, will set a date for elections was a vital safety valve. Optimism may be misplaced, for key issues - control of the security forces during the extended transition; how executive power is to be shared in the envisaged coalition - have yet to be resolved. Additionally, Chief Buthelezi, who seeks what amounts to autonomy for Natal, has not been accommodated. It is well nigh inevitable that there will be further strains on stability, whether assassinations or political violence. But unless the next round of talks produce tangible progress, there will be no safety valve. The real test of South Africa's centre may be yet to come.   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.

And if it's  Ramaphosa, will Pik Botha hang on to his post as Foreign  Minister?    The imminence of the election -- now just 17 days away -- is  sparking furious debate in political circles about who will be  occupying key posts in the new coalition Cabinet after the  voting is over, according to reliable sources. Intense interest  is focused on the race for one of two deputy presidencies  provided for in the Interim Constitution.    Polls suggest that F.W. de Klerk, as leader of the party  likely to come second in the election, will win one of the  posts. But ANC leader Nelson Mandela -- the overwhelming  favourite for president -- will have to choose the second deputy  president from his own ranks. Mbeki and Ramaphosa are regarded  as the top contenders, with Mbeki's seniority in his favour, and  Ramaphosa's stronger showing on the ANC list boosting his  chances.    The outcome could affect Botha's future. If Mbeki were not  to achieve the deputy presidency, he would be a very strong  candidate for the Foreign Ministry. As incumbent president, De  Klerk's most senior Cabinet Minister, Botha -- now the  longest-serving foreign minister in the world -- is certain to  be one of the NP MPs to be included in the Cabinet which is to  be announced early next month.    ANC sources said debate on the new Cabinet was now at an  advanced stage within the organisation.    The national executive committee had been scheduled to  discuss the issue and make recommendations on the issue this  week, but the meeting was postponed until next week because of  yesterday's four- way summit of leaders to discuss ""the Natal  problem"".    Mbeki and Ramaphosa are the two main candidates for the  position of South Africa's first deputy president, who will come  from the biggest party if no more than one other party wins more  than 20 percent of the vote. The ANC sources said there were  sensitivities over this discussion, with each man's camp making  a strong claim for the position. Ramaphosa's backers argued  that as the candidate placed immediately after Mandela on the  ANC's national election list, he should be heir-apparent to the  septuagenarian ANC leader. Mbeki's supporters -- many in the ANC  Youth League -- said he had been placed second on regional  lists, and claimed that as the list which saw Ramaphosa  leap-frogging to second spot was a result of the national  conference attended by party bosses, it did not represent ""the  will of the people"".    Should Mbeki get the deputy presidency, Botha -- whose only  other challenger is said to be ANC deputy international affairs  director Aziz Pahad -- is almost assured of the Foreign Affairs  post.    In terms of the Interim Constitution, South Africa's new  president will be obliged to appoint Ministers from parties  which have polled at least 5 percent of the vote ""on the advice  of the parties to which the relevant portfolios have been  allocated.""

It should have come as no surprise, either, that some of the  leading members of Chat Thai Party came out vehemently to raise  the specter of a concerted conspiracy to discredit the major  opposition party. And the allegation may well be valid to a  certain extent. If the timing of the ""leak"" was suspect, the  drug-trafficking episode was a clear case of violation of the  law -- American and Thai.    But the government has mishandled the scandal from the  outset. The USIS statement made it very clear that the first  official word of the indictment against this group of Thais was  relayed to the Thai government in January, 1993. Fifteen months  later, Government House, the Foreign Ministry and the Office of  Narcotics Control Board said they had no clues about the case at  all. Suddenly, the government itself was trapped by its attempt  to detach itself from a potentially sensitive issue. Prime  Minister Chuan Likphai's initial reaction to reporters'  questions was one of typical caution and detachment. It was him  all over again, warning against rushing to conclusions and  allowing the accused to state his case.    Likewise, Thai police were tonguetied. The Foreign Ministry,  presumably the only official channel through which the U.S.  Embassy had informed the Thai government about the indictment,  failed miserably to explain why it had kept quiet for so long.  The country's top drug enforcement agency under the  jurisdiction of the Prime Minister's Office, was caught  offguard, mumbling something bordering on disbelief. Its  earlier claims about close contacts with Washington's DEA in  cracking down on drug traffickers suddenly faded into oblivion.    While Thanong put on his flip-flop show, his Chat Thai Party  went through its defensive motion. Banhan Sinlapa-acha, the new  party boss, has every reason to believe that the whole exercise  was part of a well-orchestrated conspiracy against his political  career path. The leak came on the eve of his being elevated to  the post as party leader -- one year and four months after the  Thai Foreign Ministry was supposed to have been tipped about the  court case in San Francisco.    That was probably why Premier Chuan quickly turned the case  into Chat Thai's very own in-house hot potato instead of  demanding a full-fledged investigation into DEA's claim, whether  or not the key suspect was a prominent politician in the  opposition camp. One wonders whether the government would have  treated this case with the same nonchalance had the same charge  been slapped on a lawmaker on the side of the government.    The House of Representatives may have named a committee to  look into the charges. The Chat Thai Party, too, has set up its  own probe team, ostensibly to demonstrate its seriousness in  salvaging its reputation.    But the government has yet to come up with any convincing  move to underscore the fact that drug trafficking allegations  are far from a partisan issue best left to political parties  concerned. It's a national problem which affects the overall  social and economic fabric -- and the government's political  credibility in living up to its platform to crack down hard on  drugs and illicit drugs.    Prime Minister Chuan will have to get his people to answer  some of the obvious questions which have been raised in this  connection:    1. The DEA said it had submitted a official letter on  Thanong's case in January, 1993. Who in which government agency  was the recipient of the document? Why has the report been kept  under wraps all along? Why weren't the prime minister, the  foreign minister, the interior minister and the anti-narcotics  agency informed about the request?    2. If the relevant agencies were in fact informed about the  case, why did they insist, on the day the story broke, that they  were not aware of the incident? If they, in fact, had been told  about the story but were not ready to give out the truth to the  public, were they therefore lying to the people? Who were they  trying to protect? What has happened to accountability of  public servants in this country?    3. Do the law-enforcement agencies plan to take their own  action, under Thai laws, against those accused by the American  authorities? Are we, members of the Thai public, being told to  believe that the various shipments of marijuana destined for the  United States were in no way related to Thailand -- and that  they did not constitute offenses under the Thai laws at all?    4. Does the five-party coalition government stand ready to  be accused of politicizing the scandal to save itself from a no-  confidence motion -- and, in the process, undermining Chat Thai  leader Banhan's attempts to grill the government?    In other words, can the government get away with its  apparent  inefficiency and obvious lack of accountability while the  opposition tries to can this kettle of fish? The answer, plain  and simple, is no.     "

0,FT911-556 ,"FT911-556 _AN-BELAGAATFT 910511   FT  11 MAY 91 / Painful push for peace: Efforts to halt South Africa's violence      By PATTI WALDMEIR   Nelson Mandela is an angry man. In 1964, Mr Mandela, deputy president of the African National Congress (ANC), told the court trying him for treason that he was prepared to die for the ideal of 'a democratic and free society in which all persons live together in harmony and with equal opportunities'. Twenty-seven years later, the realisation of that dream has been blocked by the township violence which has resulted in the deaths of more than 1,500 people since August. That violence led Mr Mandela this week to the brink of severing contacts with the South African government on the issue of the country's post-apartheid future. For the moment, that crisis seems to have been averted, as the ANC and the government have reached outline agreement on some measures to stop the killing. But the threat of civil war remains real, and Mr Mandela's anger has yet to cool. He blames the violence on government, arguing that the police have failed to intervene in black-against-black fighting which has caused nearly 10,000 deaths since 1984; that murders are not investigated and charges seldom brought; that police have turned their own guns on ANC supporters, but rarely on those of the rival Inkatha Freedom party. 'To the whites in general, the life of a black man is cheap,' according to a top ANC official. His complaint reflects the anger and frustration that pushed the organisation to threaten to boycott constitutional talks unless Pretoria acted by Thursday to halt violence. After six hours of talks on Wednesday with Mr F W de Klerk, the South African president, Mr Mandela backed down on this threat. Both sides made concessions on the issues dividing them - the ANC's demands for a ban on carrying dangerous weapons in public; barring of the use of live ammunition by police for crowd control; phasing out of single-sex hostels; disbanding of counter-insurgency units; disciplining of police involved in recent killings; and an independent commission of inquiry to investigate violence. The seventh demand in the ultimatum issued by the ANC on April 5 - that the ministers of defence, and law and order be sacked - was clearly unrealistic, and treated as such by the government. The two sides reached what Mr de Klerk called 'broad consensus' on the most important demands. So-called 'traditional weapons' are to be banned in public, with the contentious exception of spears. Hostels will be phased out over time, though some single accommodation will be maintained. Police will follow a more impartial code of conduct in black areas. Deadlock has thus been avoided. But the resolution is far from definitive: the two sides are still fighting over whether spears, too, should be banned, or under what circumstances they could legitimately be carried; and over who should convene a planned national conference on violence. The ANC has, somewhat navely, reserved the right to revive its boycott threat unless the dispute over spears is resolved satisfactorily within the next seven days. And even if that new deadline is met, it has indicated it expects further concessions on the other demands. Obviously, this brinkmanship will not work forever: but the threat of an ANC boycott has concentrated the minds of government on the seriousness of the violence. Mr Mandela is highly emotional on the subject, which has threatened to destroy his otherwise good rapport with Mr de Klerk; and the president has committed himself to measures which, if carried out scrupulously, could reduce violence. He has forced Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, leader of the Inkatha Freedom Party, to drop his insistence that lethal implements like knobkerries, pangas and axes be carried as so-called 'traditional weapons' by his supporters. (The sight of Inkatha supporters brandishing such weapons at political rallies has often sparked conflict). And he has guaranteed the impartiality of police in situations where conflict threatens. Improved policing and the disarming of protagonists, should lead to a large drop in the number of deaths. For there have been instances to support Mr Mandela's claim that police stand by while rival supporters battle in the townships - especially when the battle favours Inkatha. They do so partly because they are heavily outnumbered by the combatants, and might be killed if they intervened; but the effect of 30 years of Pretoria's propaganda - which branded the ANC as South Africa's most important enemy - should not be underestimated. Many white policemen hate the ANC because it threatens white supremacy; and black officers fear it because the ANC calls them collaborators, and has sought to kill or maim them as part of its strategy for ending apartheid. Nobody (not even Mr Mandela) believes that Mr de Klerk seeks a continuation of the violence. But until this week, he has lacked the political will to do what he can to stop it. The next few weeks will demonstrate whether his security forces can be dragged into the new South Africa - and whether, once there, they can halt the violence. For if broad agreement has been reached between Pretoria and the ANC, powerful enmity remains between the ANC and Inkatha. Indeed, Mr Mandela's condemnation of the police is ingenuous: police may spark violence, or fail to stop it. But supporters of either Inkatha or the ANC itself have actually done almost all the killing. Contact between Mr Mandela and Chief Buthelezi were severed last month, and last Sunday an Inkatha leader threatened to deploy 100,000 heavily armed men in Soweto in a clear challenge to the ANC. So far, they cannot agree to attend the same national peace conference. ANC officials stress that local peace initiatives are going forward, including a joint peace rally tomorrow in Natal. Unless the rivalry between them can be contained, police can hardly be expected to stop the violence single-handed. Nobody can expect a rapid resolution of the crisis. The irascible and unpredictable Chief Buthelezi will never accept a deal which appears to sideline Inkatha. Mr de Klerk will no doubt continue to plead that fear of a right-wing backlash from police constrains him. And Mr Mandela will have to sell this week's compromise deal on violence to his own increasingly traumatised constituency, especially at the ANC's planned national conference in July, where new leaders will be elected. But finally, South Africa's leaders seem to be gearing themselves up to push for peace: they have begun to accept that the alternatives is simply too ghastly to contemplate.

""But in focusing on the new  imperatives, we must not forget the priorities we inherited from  the apartheid administration. We must not underplay the  importance of eradicating the violence that has over the past 10  years cost this nation tens of thousands of lives."" If the  violence is not eradicated reconstruction will be ""meaningless.""  ""While we have a new government, the obligation to end the  violence has not changed. What is different, though, is that the  new government is not weighed down by the moral culpability that  held back its predecessor."" ""Given the culpability of the past  government in the killings and complete absence of a moral will  to disarm the perpetrators of this violence, we understood the  NP's [National Party] failures to halt the violence. We also  understood the inability of the democratic forces to respond  decisively to the violence, given their lack of access to the  instruments of state security. But this has all changed.""

""The NPKF was a blunder of great magnitude,""  laments the editorial. ""We blame the ANC alliance for this  terrible waste of money (the NPKF's budget was R390 million  [rand])."" ""Why it thought that a peackeeping force was  necessary .... is beyond us. In the event, the police and army  kept the peace so well during the election that President  Mandela has given them his warm commendation.""

""The danger is that right-wingers could  deduce from President Mandela's efforts to involve them in the  political process that an Afrikaner homeland is going to be  presented to them on a silver tray."" Election results meanwhile  have shown that support for a homeland is ""minimal."" What the  right wing gained from the election was a political party --  Gen. Constand Viljoen's Freedom Front -- a seat in Parliament,  provincial legislators, and a homeland council. ""It is unlikely  that the right wing will be further accommodated."" ""An  interesting question, however, is whether further concessions  for the right wing are still necessary. Like other South  Africans, the right-wingers have already seen that the election  and developments thereafter went off well, and life is  continuing normally,"" so why still clamor for a limited piece of  homeland ""when he has the whole country to live and work in?""    Amnesty for Political Prisoners -- A second editorial on the  same page of the 1 June BEELD states that ""every South African  who has ever rejected violence as a political means must feel  uncomfortable when the question of amnesty for political  criminals is mentioned. Amnesty is a necessary evil, however.""  Since two extensions in amnesty deadlines have already been  made, ""politicians and other experts must consider whether a  third extension is really necessary,"" and if it has to happen,  ""it should be the very last."" ""The election has been a miracle,  but it has not yet freed South Africa from people who think they  can attain political goals through violence.""

In a  statement delivered to ANC [African National Congress] President  Nelson Mandela at their meeting in Durban on Tuesday [1 March],  the IFP president repeated the interim constitution was a  ""prescription for disaster"". Mr Buthelezi said however he  remained totally committed to a negotiated settlement.  ""Together we could relieve the prohibitive pressure of time  and create a space to salvage failed negotiations. This would  mean extending the election period and providing for mediation  regarding the problems that are separating us.""    Mr Buthelezi's memorandum, presented to Mr Mandela at the  beginning of their Durban summit, was leaked to the media. Mr  Buthelezi said that the failure to reach a comprehensive  constitutional settlement ""will have disastrous consequences,  and no amount of talks in advance of tanks rolling down on  Ulundi, or of white rightwing resistance being crushed, will  justify the retention of the 1993 constitution as a [word  indistinct] of the promise to come"".    The IFP president said it was glib of some leaders to say  that only elections would curb violence, adding: ""There will not  be stability, and democracy will not flow from what the ANC has  done in an unholy alliance with the National Party and the  government.""    ""The 1993 constitution...is fatally flawed. No amount of  political dressage and no amount of constitutional rephrasing of  the text around the fatal flaws can hide them.""    In addition, there was the question of the transition  process, said the IFP leader. ""We reject the TEC (transitional  executive council) and we reject the decisions it makes, and we  will not be willing accomplices in implementing them.""    He said there was a ""very substantial"" number of South  Africans who rejected the constitution and the TEC. ""How, Mr  Mandela, do you think there can be fair and free elections when  millions of South Africans reject the constitution under which  it will be held? We are democrats, Mr Mandela, and we will  exercise our democratic right to oppose a constitution we reject  and to oppose the election under it.""    On the issue of the Zulu monarchy, Mr Buthelezi said King  Goodwill Zwelithini had noted the failure of negotiations to  deliver a federal dispensation. ""Zulus want their land back,  and they now lay claim to it and they will not listen to any ANC  talk about anything to the contrary.""    Mr Buthelezi said the king's demand for a sovereign kingdom  had made recent constitutional concessions ""irrelevant"". ""They  can only be seen to be treating the symptoms of the  constitutional malady even within the drive for federalism.  They do not address the concerns of his majesty."" The Zulu  people would not put themselves and their kingdom and ultimately  their destiny in the hands of central government rule, said Mr  Buthelezi.    He added that he would stand with his ANC counterpart in an  attempt to end violence, adding that social reconstruction was  an absolute prerequisite for addressing township and rural  fighting.

Nixon library constitutes the former  President's most recent effort in a 16-year campaign to reshape the public's  view of Watergate.    Library officials repeatedly had told reporters in recent days and weeks that  the tapes presented at the museum would be left unedited. Asked Friday about  that, library director Hugh Hewitt declined to comment. ""That's a museum design  question,"" he said, adding that the museum design had been supervised by  Nixon's top aide and spokesman, John Taylor.    Taylor could not be reached for comment.    The Watergate display, which Nixon avoided when he gave President Bush and  former Presidents Ronald Reagan and Gerald R. Ford a tour of the museum  Thursday, opened to the public Friday. It consists of three White House tapes,  two of which will not be available to visitors until September, and a long wall  of text and photographs describing the events of the Watergate scandal.    The one tape available to the public now is the so-called ""smoking gun"" tape of  July 23, 1972, in which Nixon approved a plan to have the CIA warn the FBI to  stop its investigation of Watergate. The library version of the tape presents  only some portions of the conversation, stitched together with a narration that  offers innocent explanations for what Nixon is heard saying. The tape concludes  with Nixon reading a diary entry made two weeks later describing later events.    The text displays concede that ""Nixon himself has said he made inexcusable  misjudgments during Watergate"" but accuse many of Nixon's critics -- ranging  from the late Sen. Sam Ervin (D-N.C.), who chaired the Senate's investigation  of Watergate, to Archibald Cox, the Harvard law professor who served as special  prosecutor until Nixon fired him -- of ""partisan"" bias.    Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward and his former colleague Carl Bernstein  are singled out for special criticism. One display accuses the two, who won a  Pulitzer Prize for their reporting on Watergate, of ""offering bribes, illegally  gaining access to telephone numbers and talking to members of the grand jury""  in their efforts.    The display puts that accusation in quotes attributed only to an unnamed  ""scholar."" The quotation is from a recent book on Watergate by Stanley I.  Kutler of the University of Wisconsin. Kutler, in an interview Friday, said  that in the book he did not make the charge himself, but merely had noted that  others had said it. Woodward, in an interview Friday, denied ever having  offered bribes.    As portrayed in thousands of pages of transcripts from court trials and  congressional hearings, hundreds of hours of taped White House conversations  and depositions from scores of witnesses, the scandal that became known as  ""Watergate"" was, in fact, two overlapping conspiracies.    The first, begun early in the Nixon term, was a plan to use wiretaps,  burglaries and surveillance by the FBI, the CIA and independent groups  organized by White House aides to harass, spy on and punish the President's  enemies. Members of one of those independent groups, known informally as ""the  plumbers,"" were arrested on June 17, 1972, as they tried to break into the  offices of Democratic National Chairman Lawrence O'Brien in Washington's  Watergate office building.    Before the scandal ended, John D. Ehrlichman, Nixon's top domestic policy  adviser, G. Gordon Liddy, general counsel to Nixon's reelection campaign and  eight others were found guilty of criminal acts connected to that conspiracy.  The museum contains no mention of that first conspiracy or the convictions that  flowed from it.    The second conspiracy, which began almost immediately after the Watergate  arrests, was designed to cover up the first conspiracy.    Ehrlichman, H. R. Haldeman, who was Nixon's chief of staff, Atty. Gen. John N.  Mitchell and eight others were found guilty of criminal acts in connection with  that conspiracy. Nixon's own participation in the cover-up effort led the  Watergate grand jury to name him an ""unindicted co-conspirator"" on Feb. 29,  1974, and formed the basis for most of the impeachment charges that the House  Judiciary Committee approved, 27 to 11, on July 27, 1974.    As portrayed by the museum's display, the scandal that drove Nixon from office  is far different, the way the former President has always seen it: ""An epic and  bloody political battle"" in which Democrats sought to reverse the ""mandate of  the 1972 election"" by forcing him from office.    Visitors to the museum first hear of Watergate during a 27-minute film that  portrays highlights of Nixon's career. The mention is brief. ""The President  knew nothing about it,"" a narrator says, referring to the Watergate break-in.  But, the narrator continues, in the months that followed, ""some of his aides""  became involved in a ""cover-up."" The film then leaves the subject entirely,  returning only to say, without further explanation, that ""threatened with  impeachment,"" Nixon resigned.    The Watergate room itself presents a carefully selected set of facts about the  scandal. Nixon, the opening display says, ""did not pay much attention to"" the  break-in when he first heard of it the next day. That display does not mention  the fact that Nixon and Haldeman met and discussed the break-in for 20 minutes  two days later.    The tape of that July 20 discussion was mysteriously erased -- the 18  1/2-minute gap that became one of Watergate's most notorious incidents.  According to the museum display, which mentions the gap but does not explain  which conversation it involved, ""experts said the gap could easily have been  caused by a mechanical malfunction, but the President's opponents wasted no  time in finding sinister and devious motives.""    In fact, a team of experts appointed by U.S. District Judge John Sirica  reported on June 4 that the tape had been erased by hand and that  ""malfunctioning of the recorder"" was ""conclusively eliminated"" as a possible  cause of the erasures.

Library officials repeatedly had told reporters in recent days and weeks that  the tapes presented at the museum would be left unedited. Asked Friday about  that, library director Hugh Hewitt declined to comment. ""That's a museum design  question,"" he said, adding that the museum design had been supervised by  Nixon's top aide and spokesman, John Taylor.    Taylor could not be reached for comment.    The Watergate display, which Nixon avoided when he gave President Bush and  former Presidents Ronald Reagan and Gerald R. Ford a tour of the museum  Thursday, opened to the public Friday. It consists of three White House tapes,  two of which will not be available to visitors until September, and a long wall  of text and photographs describing the events of the Watergate scandal.    The one tape available to the public now is the so-called ""smoking gun"" tape of  July 23, 1972, in which Nixon approved a plan to have the CIA warn the FBI to  stop its investigation of Watergate. The library version of the tape presents  only some portions of the conversation, stitched together with a narration that  offers innocent explanations for what Nixon is heard saying. The tape concludes  with Nixon reading a diary entry made two weeks later describing later events.    The text displays concede that ""Nixon himself has said he made inexcusable  misjudgments during Watergate"" but accuse many of Nixon's critics -- ranging  from the late Sen. Sam Ervin (D-N.C.), who chaired the Senate's investigation  of Watergate, to Archibald Cox, the Harvard law professor who served as special  prosecutor until Nixon fired him -- of ""partisan"" bias.    Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward and his former colleague Carl Bernstein  are singled out for special criticism. One display accuses the two, who won a  Pulitzer Prize for their reporting on Watergate, of ""offering bribes, illegally  gaining access to telephone numbers and talking to members of the grand jury""  in their efforts.    The display puts that accusation in quotes attributed only to an unnamed  ""scholar."" The quotation is from a recent book on Watergate by Stanley I.  Kutler of the University of Wisconsin. Kutler, in an interview Friday, said  that in the book he did not make the charge himself, but merely had noted that  others had said it. Woodward, in an interview Friday, denied ever having  offered bribes.    As portrayed in thousands of pages of transcripts from court trials and  congressional hearings, hundreds of hours of taped White House conversations  and depositions from scores of witnesses, the scandal that became known as  ""Watergate"" was, in fact, two overlapping conspiracies.    The first, begun early in the Nixon term, was a plan to use wiretaps,  burglaries and surveillance by the FBI, the CIA and independent groups  organized by White House aides to harass, spy on and punish the President's  enemies. Members of one of those independent groups, known informally as ""the  plumbers,"" were arrested on June 17, 1972, as they tried to break into the  offices of Democratic National Chairman Lawrence O'Brien in Washington's  Watergate office building.    Before the scandal ended, John D. Ehrlichman, Nixon's top domestic policy  adviser, G. Gordon Liddy, general counsel to Nixon's reelection campaign and  eight others were found guilty of criminal acts connected to that conspiracy.  The museum contains no mention of that first conspiracy or the convictions that  flowed from it.    The second conspiracy, which began almost immediately after the Watergate  arrests, was designed to cover up the first conspiracy.    Ehrlichman, H. R. Haldeman, who was Nixon's chief of staff, Atty. Gen. John N.  Mitchell and eight others were found guilty of criminal acts in connection with  that conspiracy. Nixon's own participation in the cover-up effort led the  Watergate grand jury to name him an ""unindicted co-conspirator"" on Feb. 29,  1974, and formed the basis for most of the impeachment charges that the House  Judiciary Committee approved, 27 to 11, on July 27, 1974.    As portrayed by the museum's display, the scandal that drove Nixon from office  is far different, the way the former President has always seen it: ""An epic and  bloody political battle"" in which Democrats sought to reverse the ""mandate of  the 1972 election"" by forcing him from office.    Visitors to the museum first hear of Watergate during a 27-minute film that  portrays highlights of Nixon's career. The mention is brief. ""The President  knew nothing about it,"" a narrator says, referring to the Watergate break-in.  But, the narrator continues, in the months that followed, ""some of his aides""  became involved in a ""cover-up."" The film then leaves the subject entirely,  returning only to say, without further explanation, that ""threatened with  impeachment,"" Nixon resigned.    The Watergate room itself presents a carefully selected set of facts about the  scandal. Nixon, the opening display says, ""did not pay much attention to"" the  break-in when he first heard of it the next day. That display does not mention  the fact that Nixon and Haldeman met and discussed the break-in for 20 minutes  two days later.    The tape of that July 20 discussion was mysteriously erased -- the 18  1/2-minute gap that became one of Watergate's most notorious incidents.  According to the museum display, which mentions the gap but does not explain  which conversation it involved, ""experts said the gap could easily have been  caused by a mechanical malfunction, but the President's opponents wasted no  time in finding sinister and devious motives.""    In fact, a team of experts appointed by U.S. District Judge John Sirica  reported on June 4 that the tape had been erased by hand and that  ""malfunctioning of the recorder"" was ""conclusively eliminated"" as a possible  cause of the erasures.

I have personally been deeply saddened by the countless  numbers of ordinary people who have lost their lives in the  violence that has racked South Africa. Innocent blood has been  shed, and all South Africans, regardless of their political  affiliation, race, ethnic or language group, have been  diminished by it. These are losses to South Africa as a nation  which all of us should mourn.    Today's action, has one purpose and should have one purpose  only: that is to stem the tide of violence, which if left  unaddressed will engulf us all. It is criminal that the  citizens of this country - who ever they are - should be reduced  to pawns in the political games of ambitious leaders. People  deserve the right to be able to lead their lives without fear of  violence. They deserve the right to express themselves without  threats of death being visited upon them. They deserve the  right to choose for themselves whether or not they will vote in  the coming elections.    These are the issues at stake in Natal and kwaZulu and no  political rhetoric must be allowed to obscure that. The state  of emergency enjoys my wholehearted support and I appeal to all  South Africans to abstain from any actions that will impair its  purpose.    I shall expect all ANC organised structures in Natal and  kwaZulu to so conduct themselves as to assist the attainment of  the objectives I have underscored. ANC members and supporters  must take the lead in ensuring that the climate of violence and  bloodletting in that province abates so that our people in Natal  and kwaZulu can freely exercise their rights to participate in  the elections, if they so choose, or to stay away from the polls  if that is their decision.    I am making an appeal to all of us to remain calm. There are  those who fear democracy and are bent on creating the maximum  amount of chaos through acts of violence and mayhem. We have  already seen them in action in a number of cities.    We must all affirm our commitment to peaceful, free and fair  elections by protecting every citizens right to participate  without let or hindrance from any quarter. As leaders of  political opinion we must all affirm our commitment to peaceful,  free and fair elections by asserting and protecting the right of  every political party, however objectionable we might consider  its views, to express itself and canvass support without fear of  intimidation from any quarter.    That it has been necessary to have recourse to such measures  in Natal is highly regrettable. As a movement we have used  every ounce of the talent we have to try to find another way.  We remain committed to seeking a dialogue with King Zwelithini  Kabhekuzulu. We shall continue bilateral discussions with the  Inkatha Freedom Party. I am ready to proceed with the propose  summit among President de Klerk, Chief Minister Buthelezi, the  Zulu monarch and myself.    A number of measures become necessary if this limited state  of emergency is to achieve its stated purpose. I expect that  the security forces will with all deliberate speed take steps to  contain the perpetrators of violence and death. All those  persons whom investigations have implicated in hit squad  activities should be apprehended, charged and brought before the  law courts as swiftly as possible. All members of the security  forces who have similarly been implicated should be disarmed and  suspended from duty forthwith. This necessarily must include  the Caprivi Strip trainees who have since been absorbed in  various structures of the kwaZulu administration. I expect, too  that the training camps established with the express aim of  destabilising that province will be shut down immediately.    While these drastic measures have become necessary to save  life, we must not allow the draconian powers which the state has  assumed to become yet one more obstacle on our road to  democracy. The mini-state of emergency has been proclaimed so  that the elections may proceed in an atmosphere of calm. Its  provisions must not be subversive of free political activity nor  must they be employed to harass and intimidate the political  opponents of the kwaZulu administration. Police units, such as  the Internal Stability Division, that have demonstrably lost the  confidence of a wide section of the African community should not  be deployed in Natal.    The postponement of the April 27th elections is not an  option  that our country can afford. I reaffirm the ANC's stand that we  shall not contemplate such a postponement. The steps taken  today should enable us to proceed to the agreed election date in  a context of relative peace.    All of us must assume responsibility for seeing this  transition through to the end. The ANC will play its part. We  invite other political parties to do likewise. We cannot and  shall not allow the spoilers and the wreckers to succeed. To  succumb to their threats and bullying tactics now would be a  fatal error.    The ANC remains extremely confident about our country's  future. This is a truly historic moment of opportunity and  challenge. In years to come we will look back on these days as  but an interlude in a period of great optimism. The future we  can build as a nation beckons us. Let us all work together and  we shall surely build a better life for all South Africans.     "

EVANGELIST OFFERS $52 MILLION TO BUY SCANDALIZED PTL MINISTRY;    RELIGION: MORRIS CERULLO HAS PUT DOWN $7 MILLION IN 'PHASE ONE' OF PURCHASE OF  BAKKER-FOUNDED EMPIRE.      By CHRIS KRAUL, SAN DIEGO COUNTY BUSINESS EDITOR      Morris Cerullo, a faith healer who is head of the San Diego-based Worldwide  Evangelism ministry, has offered to buy the assets of the scandal-plagued PTL  ministry for $52 million.    PTL, founded by defrocked TV evangelist Jim Bakker, has been in the control of  U. S. Bankruptcy Court since June, 1987, two months after Bakker resigned from  the ministry following the emergence of a sex-and-money scandal involving  former church secretary Jessica Hahn.    Bakker is serving a 45-year federal prison term in Minnesota after his  conviction last October on fraud and conspiracy counts.    Cerullo, 58, and his church are best known locally for having owned the El  Cortez Hotel in San Diego, where he ran a short-lived evangelism school before  selling the property in 1981. Cerullo also proposed a grandiose 200-acre  retirement center and religious education center on land the church owned in  the Mira Mesa area, but ended up selling the property to home builder Pardee  Construction.    PTL Trustee Dennis W. Shedd, an attorney in Columbia, S. C., confirmed  Cerullo's offer, saying the preacher had put $7 million cash in an escrow  account in Columbia to cover purchase of the PTL cable TV network and a  broadcast production studio, which Shedd referred to as ""phase one"" of the  sale.    Shedd said Cerullo is in the process of securing financing to buy ""phase two""  of PTL: the 2,200-acre Heritage USA theme park in Ft. Mill, S. C., 15 miles  south of Charlotte, N. C. The theme park, which includes a completed 500-room  Heritage Grand hotel and another 500-room hotel still under construction, as  well as a water slide, shopping mall and miniature railroad, has been closed  since September.    Cerullo, who was unavailable for comment Wednesday, intends to resume operation  and development of Heritage USA as a religious theme park, Shedd said. Of the  park's 2,200 acres, about 500 are developed. The Heritage USA phase of the sale  to Cerullo is expected to close later this year, he said.    Shedd said he will file a motion today with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in  Columbia seeking approval of the offer by Cerullo. A hearing was scheduled at  the court this morning to consider a $6.3-million offer for PTL's cable TV  network from evangelist Oral Roberts.    Shedd said the Cerullo offer is ""a good deal (for the PTL estate) because it is  the only package offer (for all PTL assets) that we have received, and the part  of the package allocated to the network is more money than anyone has offered.""    Last year, a Canadian developer offered to buy the Heritage USA theme park, but  the deal fell through after it became apparent that he could not obtain clear  title to the property. Ownership of the land is disputed by an Indian tribe  that has claimed in a lawsuit that the property was illegally taken from them  by the U. S. government in the 1800s.    The PTL satellite cable network consists of a leasehold interest in a cable TV  satellite controlled by HBO and an ""uplink,"" or earth-to-satellite transmission  facility. The PTL network still operates, carrying other evangelists'  programming, including Cerullo's, but no longer produces programming of its  own, Shedd said.    The PTL network is accessed by 800 cable TV systems across the United States,  which in turn can reach 6.5 million households, Shedd said. In court documents,  however, HBO has argued that Shedd has no power as trustee to transfer the  leasehold interest in the satellite to a new buyer. It was unclear Wednesday  whether HBO would dispute the sale of the network to Cerullo.    Cerullo was once a friend to Jim Bakker and appeared on the ""Jim and Tammy  Show,"" the once-popular program hosted by Bakker and his wife. Cerullo was  ordained in the Assembly of God Church, the same denomination that defrocked  Bakker in 1987 after the Jessica Hahn scandal but is not now affiliated with  any particular denomination.    Bakker allegedly had sex with Hahn and then made payments to her to hush up the  incident. With the scandal broiling around him and his ministry drowning in  financial problems, Bakker turned PTL operations over to preacher Jerry Falwell  in April, 1987. Two months later, Falwell placed the ministry in bankruptcy and  turned over its financial records to the U. S. Department of Justice.    Cerullo, who grew up in a New Jersey orphanage, directs a ministry that  produces videotapes and television programming and which conducts operations in  Europe, Canada, Israel and Zimbabwe as well as in the United States. Worldwide  Evangelism solicits funds from viewers and church members via direct-mail,  telephone and televised appeals.    The evangelist came under fire in the early 1980s when it came to light that  trust funds from donors, some of whom were told they would receive lifetime  income on their donations, were being invested in second and third trust deeds,  a risky kind of mortgage loan.    Cerullo's Worldwide Evangelism bought the 250-room El Cortez Hotel in 1978 for  $6.5 million, but was unsuccessful in making it a religious education and  training center. During the two years the training center was open, Cerullo  became involved in several disputes with contractors, students, real estate  brokers and labor unions.    Cerullo sold the hotel in 1981 to Denver developer Terry Considine, who  unsuccessfully proposed it as the site of the San Diego Convention Center,  which was ultimately built on Harbor Drive. Considine subsequently sold the  landmark to the Grosvenor family, who last year formed a joint venture with  Japanese investors to build a $250-million hotel complex.

Out of the experience of an extraordinary human disaster  that  lasted too too long, must be born a society of which all  humanity will be proud.    Our daily deeds as ordinary South Africans must produce an  actual South African reality that will reinforce humanity's  belief in justice, strengthen its confidence in the nobility of  the human soul and sustain all our hopes for a glorious life for  all.    All this we owe both to ourselves and to the peoples of the  world who are so well represented here today.    To my compatriots, I have no hesitation in saying that each  one of us is as intimately attached to the soil of this  beautiful country as are the famous jacaranda trees of Pretoria  and the mimosa trees of the bushveld.    Each time one of us touches the soil of this land, we feel a  sense of personal renewal. The national mood changes as the  seasons change.    We are moved by a sense of joy and exhilaration when the  grass turns green and the flowers bloom.    That spiritual and physical oneness we all share with this  common homeland explains the depth of the pain we all carried in  our hearts as we saw our country tear itself apart in a terrible  conflict, and as we saw it spurned, outlawed and isolated by the  peoples of the world, precisely because it has become the  universal base of the pernicious ideology and practice of racism  and racial oppression.    We, the people of South Africa, feel fulfilled that humanity  has taken us back into its bosom, that we, who were outlaws not  so long ago, have today been given the rare privilege to be host  to the nations of the world on our own soil.    We thank all our distinguished international guests for  having come to take possession with the people of our country of  what is, after all, a common victory for justice, for peace, for  human dignity. We trust that you will continue to stand by us  as we tackle the challenges of building peace, prosperity,  non-sexism, non-racialism and democracy.    We deeply appreciate the role that the masses of our people  and their political mass democratic, religious, women, youth,  business, traditional and other leaders have played to bring  about this conclusion. Not least among them is my second deputy  president, the honourable F.W. de Klerk.    We would also like to pay tribute to our security forces, in  all their ranks, for the distinguished role they have played in  securing our first democratic elections and the transition to  democracy, from blood-thirsty forces which still refuse to see  the light.    The time for the healing of the wounds has come. The moment  to bridge the chasms that divide us has come.    The time to build is upon us.    We have, at last, achieved our political emancipation. We  pledge ourselves to liberate all our people from the continuing  bondage of poverty, deprivation, suffering, gender and other  discrimination.    We succeeded to take our last steps to freedom in conditions  of relative peace. We commit ourselves to the construction of a  complete, just and lasting peace.    We have triumphed in the effort to implant hope in the  breasts of the millions of our people. We enter into a covenant  that we shall build the society in which all South Africans,  both black and white, will be able to walk tall, without any  fear in their hearts, assured of their inalienable right to  human dignity -- a rainbow nation at peace with itself and the  world.    As a token of its commitment to the renewal of our country,  the new interim government of national unity will, as a matter  of urgency, address the issue of amnesty for various categories  of our people who are currently serving terms of imprisonment.    We dedicate this day to all the heroes and heroines in this  country and the rest of the world who sacrificed in many ways  and surrendered their lives so that we could be free.    Their dreams have become reality. Freedom is their reward.  We are both humbled and elevated by the honour and privilege  that you, the people of South Africa, have bestowed on us, as  the first president of a united, democratic, non-racial and  non-sexist South Africa, to lead our country out of the valley  of darkness.    We understand it still that there is no easy road to  freedom.  We know it well that none of us acting alone can achieve  success.    We must therefore act together as a united people, for  national reconciliation, for nation building, for the birth of a  new world.    Let there be justice for all.    Let there be peace for all.    Let there be work, bread, water and salt for all.    Let each know that for each the body, the mind and the soul  have been freed to fulfill themselves.    Never, never and never again shall it be that this beautiful  land will again experience the oppression of one by another and  suffer the indignity of being the skunk of the world.    The sun shall never set on so glorious a human achievement!    Let freedom reign.    God bless Africa!    Thank you.     "

Today, Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina and South  African Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo signed the protocol that  establishes a new status in relations between Pretoria and  Havana.    Up until now, the two governments had not maintained  diplomatic ties because of the Caribbean island authorities'  rejection of the now-dismantled racist system of apartheid.    Less than 48 hours after assuming the presidency, Nelson  Mandela, leader of the African National Congress (ANC),  finalized the government decision, reaffirming the relations of  friendship and solidarity maintained for years between Cuba and  the then-outlawed ANC.    Regarding the possibilities of cooperation between Cuba and  the South African state, Cuban President Fidel Castro had told  PRENSA LATINA: There are few countries that have the fraternal  links that we share with South Africa.    The country has, on the one hand, great development and  standards of living, and, on the other hand, it has enormous  social needs in the areas of public health, employment,  education, housing, and transportation, which we were able to  appreciate in our talks with members of the South African  cabinet, Castro said.    Castro added: Probably with no other country is there the  possibility of such broad Cuban cooperation than with South  Africa, as we work on developing fraternal and heart-felt ties  between both peoples.    After signing the protocol, Alfredo Nzo, former secretary of  international relations of the ANC, told Robaina that the new  South Africa did not want Fidel Castro to end his visit before  making this decision.    For his part, Robaina underlined the importance of the  signing of the agreement, not only because of its great  significance, but because it is the first protocol signed by Nzo  as foreign minister. Cuba has close cooperative relations with  other African states in the areas of health, construction,  sports, and education, which can also be extended to South  Africa, he said. Hundreds of ANC youths have studied in the past  at education centers in Cuba, it was noted.    There were times of serious confrontation between the two  states, Fidel Castro pointed out during his visit, recalling  Cuba's international opposition to the aggressive policy  maintained by the dismantled apartheid regime against the South  African black majority and the peoples of Namibia and Angola.  ""Now there is a new South Africa, where peace, respect, and  love toward Cuba exist,"" he stated.    The Cuban delegation, headed by President Fidel Castro,  concluded its first official and friendly visit to South Africa  today. The Cuban delegation began its visit Monday to attend  Mandela's inauguration. Mandela is the first black president of  the country, which now has unequivocally left behind more than  three centuries of racial discrimination.    In terms of Cuba's representation, Roberto Robaina was  accompanied at the signing ceremony by Angel Dalmau, Cuban  ambassador in Namibia; Rosa Elena Simeon, minister of science,  technology, and environment; and Marcos Rodriguez, diplomatic  counselor, who will temporarily represent the Cuban Government  in Pretoria.

0,FT934-4235 ,"FT934-4235 _AN-DLEAMADQFT 931204   FT  04 DEC 93 / Why the whites handed over their power: Last month South Africa's white rulers agreed a new constitution which will end white hegemony. Patti Waldmeir explains how it happened      By PATTI WALDMEIR   South Africa has delivered itself of a political miracle: sometime in the dark hours of November 18, almost imperceptibly, white hands let go their 350-year grip on the baton of power. The combined forces of history, economics, demography and morality had decreed the end of white rule; and South Africa's leaders had the grace - or the good sense - to recognise the inevitable. The story of their conversion - which began in the late 1970s and reached a climax the night before the new constitution was signed - is strange and wonderful. History provides few enough examples of the triumph of pragmatism over ethnicity, or religion, and South Africa's National Party was scarcely famous for good sense in the decades of apartheid. But in the pre-dawn hours of November 18, white hands seized black ones, offering the cult handshake of the African National Congress to seal a pragmatic new constitution; and the two men who struggled for months to complete the deal - Cyril Ramaphosa, ANC chief negotiator, and Roelf Meyer, his government counterpart - danced until the early hours, in an atmosphere heady with emotion and exhaustion. In the days that followed, Meyer and his colleagues have continued to laud a constitutional deal which included many last-minute reverses for the National party - a deal which, in essence, permits what the party had always said was impossible: the handover of state power to blacks. Pleased now to have any deal at all after a tough four-year struggle, they are convinced that the voluntary power-sharing promised by the constitution will give them real clout. Some days after the momentous night on which the new South Africa was born, I watched as a Meyer - boyish, handsome and charming - ducked into the ANC's private lavatory to fix his hair before posing for a victory photo. Moments later, the equally youthful and charming Ramaphosa did the same; then the two set off together, laughing, for their appointment with the photographer. I reflected on the extraordinary trust and goodwill built up over the last four years of momentous change - and which will no doubt come under serious strain once the two parties start cohabiting in government - and recalled my first experience of South Africa: the day in 1985 when Archbishop Desmond Tutu (while I stood near) intervened to stop a township crowd burning a man to death during a political funeral. That year - had I but known it at the time - marked perhaps the first inevitable step to black rule. When in 1985 President P W Botha promised equal citizenship to all South Africans, including blacks, the death knell sounded for apartheid, which had decreed that blacks must live separately as citizens of distant homelands. It was not the first step away from white hegemony: as early as the late 1970s, the Afrikaner establishment - through its secret society, the Broederbond (Brotherhood) - had begun to debate sharing power with mixed-race Coloureds and Indians, but not with blacks who formed the vast majority of the population. A participant in one of the early Broederbond meetings on power sharing remembers, with a rueful chuckle, that it took place in the holiday home of H F Verwoerd, the late prime minister and grand architect of apartheid. Reflecting on the irony of history, the participant remembers that Prof Gerrit Viljoen, then chairman of the Broederbond and a prime mover of reform under President F W de Klerk, sat beneath a portrait of Verwoerd as he argued for an end to exclusive white power. Then, in 1986, Pretoria opened secret negotiations with Nelson Mandela, serving his 23rd year in prison. His first interlocutor was, ironically, Kobie Coetsee, the hardline Minister of Justice who is known to oppose many provisions of the constitution agreed last month. Later, Botha set up a four-man committee to negotiate with Mandela, including two figures who remained prominent in the final negotiations: the sharp and ruthless Neil Barnard, former head of the National Intelligence Service and now head of the department of Constitutional Development, and Fanie van der Merwe, eminence grise in the government negotiating team. Mandela told me and a few colleagues over breakfast in 1992 that he did not tell his fellow ANC leaders he had met Barnard and van der Merwe. 'They would have refused,' he said. Members of the committee say their aim in talking to Mandela was to discover whether he was committed to peace, and whether he was a communist. By 1989, Pretoria had clearly concluded, in spite of his continuing refusal to end armed struggle, that Mandela was essentially a man of peace. In July that year, he was taken to the presidential office at Tuynhuys in Cape Town to meet President Botha (who resigned from office weeks later). Mandela remembers the meeting fondly, recalling that President Botha 'poured the tea himself.' From the day Botha left office, reform proceeded apace. For, although he laid the basis for the changes of the 1990s - repealing the nefarious influx control regulations which kept blacks out of cities, and which forced them to carry the hated passbook; legalising mixed marriages and relaxing residential segregation - he left the biggest risks untaken. History will laud President de Klerk, who took office as acting president in August 1989, for having the courage to leap where President Botha stood still. Reform came in a rush with de Klerk's election on September 6, 1989. Mass public protest was legalised, political prisoners were released, the ANC and South African Communist Party were unbanned (on February 2 1990) and finally, on February 11 1990, Nelson Mandela, the world's most famous political prisoner walked free. Speaking days before Mandela was released, Con Botha, the senior Nationalist politician who is now administrator (governor) of Natal province, told the FT that he and his colleagues felt a great weight lifted from their shoulders. 'We have to make peace with our black people while we still have the chance.' F W de Klerk, who according to some of his colleagues was no early convert to reform, leapt at the chance to make peace before it was too late. Prof Viljoen, who retired last year because of ill health, remembers that the strongest impetus to change came after the 1989 demise of communist regimes which had been the ANC's main military backers. 'We recognised it as a unique opportunity in the course of history, a God-given opportunity - we thought of it very much in Christian terms - to ensure that conflict in South Africa could be resolved.' De Klerk drew the parallel with Rhodesia: 'When the opportunity was there for real constructive negotiation, it was not grasped,' he said in February 1990. 'We are determined not to repeat that mistake.' With Mandela's release, negotiations began in earnest - always on the basis, according to de Klerk, that whites 'were not prepared to bow out apologetically from the stage of history.' His aim, argues Heribert Adam, the political scientist, was to pre-empt revolution: not to negotiate himself out of power, but into power under different circumstances which would have left whites with a veto over major issues, or at least substantial blocking power in cabinet). Such a deal may well have been on offer early in the negotiations - although senior Nats argue that an early deal would have prevented the process of building trust with the ANC, the main business of the last three years. That process has undoubtedly been successful: intense relationships developed over the months with government and ANC negotiators withdrawing regularly to bush hide-outs for cozy consultations. Their improved relations were shown on one fishing trip - which Ramaphosa claims was arranged without his knowledge - when the tough Ramaphosa removed a hook from Meyer's finger. But by the eve of the deal, entrenched power sharing was no longer on offer. In the end the balance of advantage shifted decisively towards the ANC. This shift began after the Convention for a Democratic South Africa, the multi-party negotiating forum, fell apart in May last year. At its May 15-16 plenary conference, the National Party staged a high risk gamble for power, and lost. Speaking after the conference ended in disarray, de Klerk seemed oddly confident of his strength; but the events of the succeeding months undermined his position. 'The Nats peaked at Codesa,' says a senior ANC negotiator. 'At that point, the ANC had serious problems: its members were complaining about negotiations, (Ronnie) Kasrils still had dreams of insurrection, the regime was dizzy with international invitations, Inkatha was still intact as its negotiating ally, and the Nats had high hopes of forming a non racial party.' Everything went downhill from there. International opinion turned against de Klerk after the June massacre at Boipatong, for which he was indirectly blamed; the ANC bolstered its confidence through mass action; and then in April this year, ANC leader Chris Hani was assassinated, permanently tilting the balance in the ANC's favour and allowing them to extract the crucial concession from government: agreement that elections would be held on April 27 next year. That was a trap, from which the government proved unable to escape. 'In the end, time made it impossible for them to hold out,' says Joe Slovo, eminence grise of the ANC team. His November 1992 decision to persuade the ANC to offer a deal based on power-sharing was a crucial step on the way to last month's deal. He argues that power sharing is necessary because: 'All we will achieve when we have won the election is to gain political office. We would not gain state power in the sense of having a complete transformation on day one of the police, the armed forces, the judiciary and the civil service'. To ensure compliance from those constituencies, the ANC needs the National Party: so Slovo has assured Government negotiators, and so, crucially, Mandela has assured de Klerk. But power-sharing will be purely voluntary: 'We won the battle for an executive which at the end of the day is based on majority decision making - something I thought we would not win. None of us thought, even a week (before), that we could win that,' says Slovo. 'Power sharing? Madiba cracked him,' says another senior ANC negotiator, referring to the 11th hour meeting between Madiba (Mandela's clan name) and de Klerk on the eve of the deal. ANC negotiators had let it be known that they would agree to a requirement that important issues be passed by a special majority of Cabinet (which would include other parties like the NP). But Mandela offered no such concession; power would be shared voluntarily, or not at all. Mandela would seek consensus where possible; 'but in the end, if we differ, we are not required to listen to them,' another senior negotiator concludes. He disputes the definition of power sharing offered by a prominent Nationalist: 'Whites will still have one hand on the tiller. There will be other hands and the white hand won't necessarily be the strongest, but it will be there.' 'How can that be?' asks the ANC man, who is too senior to be named without embarrassment, 'if it's not in the constitution?' 'We must make ourselves indispensible - that is the recipr for the future,' counters Meyer while Con Botha adds: 'The failure of apartheid has shown us the folly of relying on laws alone to sustain yourself.' 'Once you've crossed the Rubicon, you have to move forward fearlessly in another direction, even though it is into uncharted waters.' Another prominent Afrikaner completes the metaphor, and sums up the cautious optimism which is the true fruit of negotiations: 'We're still between the devil and the deep blue sea. But at least we've got a raft to take us through the rapids.'   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.   Industries:-  P9199 General Government, NEC.     P8651 Political Organizations.

WILLIAM DANNEMEYER A BIGOT; OTHERS SAY HE'S A HERO.  ALL AGREE HE NEVER BACKS DOWN, AND ENJOYS A GOOD FIGHT.      By ROBERT W. STEWART, TIMES STAFF WRITER      WASHINGTON      In the packed committee chambers, lawmakers stared in disbelief at Rep. William  E. Dannemeyer, the Orange County Republican with the jutting jaw and ramrod  posture, whose views on the decline of morality in the late 20th Century have  become legend on Capitol Hill.    The House Energy and Commerce Committee had just announced a hard-won  compromise on landmark clean air legislation. Dannemeyer, one of the most  conservative members of Congress, was the first to offer an amendment.    If Congress were going to clean up the nation's air, Dannemeyer told his  colleagues, it ought to go a step further and clean up the nation's airwaves.  The six-term congressman then offered language to establish ""airwave emission  standards"" and $50-million penalties to ensure that television stations do not  broadcast pornographic programs.    Although the amendment was ruled out of order, it prompted one lobbyist to  remark, ""I hadn't seen anything as entertaining since Jim Watt,"" the former  secretary of the interior.    The exercise in political theater came as no surprise to those who have seen  Dannemeyer take the floor of the House of Representatives to lash out at  abortion, moral relativism, the decline of the American greenback, what he says  is the destructive influence of pornography, what he sees as the increasing  power of homosexual activists, what he considers the politicization of the AIDS  epidemic, and, most recently, Nelson Mandela.    Some call Dannemeyer a dangerous bigot. Others dismiss him as irrelevant. But  to many conservatives, he is a genuine hero. And more than a few political  observers who take issue with most of his views say Dannemeyer is a man driven  by sincere religious conviction who acts as a lightning rod for debate on the  most controversial issues of our time.    Just last month, as Washington was warmly welcoming Nelson Mandela, the deputy  president of the African National Congress, Dannemeyer struck again.    In a speech on the House floor the day before Mandela addressed a rare joint  session of Congress, Dannemeyer -- infuriating many people -- denounced the  South African black nationalist, who was recently freed after spending 27 years  in a South African prison, as an unrepentant terrorist and communist.    ""Nelson Mandela is no Martin Luther King,"" Dannemeyer said. ""He is more like H.  Rap Brown or Willie Horton."" Brown was a radical of the 1960s, and Horton is a  convicted murderer who raped a woman while on furlough from a Massachusetts  prison.    In a subsequent speech, Dannemeyer asked: ""What is the difference between  Nelson Mandela and Ethel and Julius Rosenberg,"" the Americans executed in 1953  for passing atomic secrets to the Soviet Union?    ""Mandela pleaded guilty.""    The remarks prompted a spate of outraged letters to the editor and a scathingly  critical column in the Washington Post.    Despite his chosen role as preacher to the House, there is more to Dannemeyer  than his rhetoric. Behind the fire and brimstone, the congressman from  Fullerton is not the relentlessly one-dimensional caricature his critics  sometimes paint.    Dannemeyer's performance before the energy committee, for example, betrayed a  sense of humor so dry it often goes unnoticed. The ""clean airwaves amendment""  was, of course, a serious expression of his alarm over what he perceives to be  the demise of cultural standards.    But it also was a satirical, if deadpan, slap at the clean air bill itself,  legislation Dannemeyer viewed as hopelessly burdensome and complicated. When  the bill finally passed the House, Dannemeyer was one of only 21  representatives who voted against it.    While critics sometimes portray Dannemeyer as a bigot, one liberal Democrat  said he has stood up for the rights of minorities. Rep. Don Edwards (D-San  Jose), who chairs a House Judiciary subcommittee on which Dannemeyer serves,  recalled that Dannemeyer ""was very indignant about the alleged discrimination  against minorities and women in the FBI's hiring. I was pleased. It's to Bill  Dannemeyer's credit.""    There is one Dannemeyer quality that is evident to everyone: Those who love him  and those who loathe him say the former prosecutor and state legislator, born  in South Gate nearly 61 years ago, lives for a good fight.    ""He's a true believer. He's a Lutheran elder who will not shade moral issues,""  said Dannemeyer's comrade-in-arms, Rep. Robert K. Dornan of Garden Grove.    ""If (Dannemeyer) thinks something is immoral, he says it,"" Dornan said. ""There  are precious few people like that in the House.""    One of Dannemeyer's most severe critics -- Thomas B. Stoddard, executive  director of the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, the nation's largest  gay rights group -- put it another way: ""Most politicians avoid controversy  because controversy simply buys trouble. Controversy buys enemies. Mr.  Dannemeyer embraces controversy.""    Dannemeyer concedes the point.    ""I'm a lawyer by profession,"" he said. ""I'm not intimidated by the adversarial  process. I never have been. I've made my living in litigation. I sleep nights.""    A Dannemeyer aide recalled the time his boss recounted to a group of lobbyists  the story of how Dannemeyer, an avid fisherman, had landed a 45-pound grouper  after a wrenching, hourlong tug of war.    ""One of the lobbyists looked up and said, 'You must have been exhausted after  that,' "" recalled Michael G. Franc, Dannemeyer's legislative counsel. ""And  (Dannemeyer) looked at him, and he smiled, and he said, 'Sir, I was  exhilarated.' ""    Almost every public action he takes encourages the view that Dannemeyer gets a  charge out of mixing it up with liberals who are out, in the words of one aide,  to ""ruin America.""    Last summer, Dannemeyer shocked -- and apparently titillated -- many on Capitol  Hill when he inserted into the Congressional Record, the official journal of  congressional proceedings, a lengthy attack on the influence of homosexuals on  federal policy.    The most controversial passage, titled ""What Homosexuals Do,"" recited in  clinical detail ""the average homosexual's favorite activities."" The passage was  so graphic that it prompted Rep. Andrew Jacobs Jr. (D-Ind.) to call for an  ethics committee investigation of Dannemeyer for placing obscene material in  the Record. The committee never took up the request.    Dannemeyer has written a book, published last fall, titled ""Shadow in the  Land."" In it, he asserts that homosexuality ""is not undeniably an inherited  orientation, but is probably a bad habit acquired in early childhood or  puberty."" He also attacks gay rights activists for attempting the wholesale  restructuring of American society by demanding ""special rights,"" and says: ""We  must either defeat militant homosexuality or it will defeat us.""    And there is more to come. Dannemeyer has vowed to push for a floor vote to  expel from Congress Rep. Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat who has  admitted placing on his personal payroll a homosexual prostitute with whom he  once had a sexual relationship.    One of the most liberal members of Congress, Frank also is one of two lawmakers  who have publicly disclosed their homosexuality. (The other is Gerry Studds,  also a Massachusetts Democrat.) The House Committee on Standards of Official  Conduct has struggled with the Frank case for nearly a year.    ""Right field doesn't even begin to describe (Dannemeyer) in some respects,""  said Norman J. Ornstein, a Congress watcher and political scientist with the  Washington-based American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank.  ""He's really out in the bleachers.""    According to those who watch his performance in Congress, Dannemeyer pays a  price for his outspokenness -- or outrageousness.    He clearly makes many Republicans uncomfortable. In 1988, when he sought the  chairmanship of the House Republican Conference, he won only seven votes. A  year earlier, he lost out to two freshmen congressmen in a bid for a seat on  the House Budget Committee, despite his well-known interest in fiscal affairs.    Some local officials complain privately that Dannemeyer, because of his staunch  fiscal conservatism, often has voted against spending bills that benefit Orange  County. But he did work hard to win approval for funds to begin construction of  the $1.5-billion Santa Ana River flood control project, they say.    In the legislative arena, Dannemeyer has a mixed record. His bills, like those  of most members of the minority party, are routinely put on the back burner by  Democratic committee chairmen. His annual alternate budget resolutions lose by  wide margins.    ""He becomes so inflexible . . . that it becomes difficult for him to accomplish  much of anything of what he wants,"" said Rep. Henry A. Waxman, the liberal Los  Angeles Democrat who is Dannemeyer's nemesis on the issues of AIDS and clean  air.    Dannemeyer, Waxman said, ""will seek opportunities to try to make his point even  if it has nothing to do with the issue at hand. . . . It's almost an assault on  people, that this is what he believes and everybody else must be confronted  with it rather than persuaded.""    Yet Dannemeyer has won some notable floor fights. In early 1989, he managed to  turn a motion to adjourn the House into a symbolic vote on a Congressional pay  raise that he opposed, and he prevailed. Last fall, he persuaded the House to  accept strict guidelines on telephone ""dial-a-porn"" services.    More recently, three of his amendments to new AIDS legislation were adopted in  committee or subcommittee. But he lost a 312-113 floor vote on the most  significant amendment, which would have forced states to require doctors to  report to public health agencies the identities of patients who test positive  for the AIDS virus.    Despite Dannemeyer's infrequent legislative successes, Ornstein said, ""one of  the things you can say about the handful of people in the Congress who verge to  the fringes is that . . . they often, by stirring up the dust in areas people  don't want stirred up, get discussion going that might not otherwise take  place.""    A case in point, Ornstein said, is Dannemeyer's speech on Mandela. ""While the  analogy he raised about Nelson Mandela was ungracious, and for an awful lot of  people, deeply offensive . . . it raised to another level of discussion the  question of who and what Nelson Mandela is.""    Not everyone agrees. Washington Post columnist Richard Cohen last week  denounced Dannemeyer as ""the renaissance man of bigotry."" His remarks about  Mandela were ""as repulsive a statement as Washington has heard in recent  times,"" Cohen wrote.    ""He's dangerous,"" said Stoddard, the gay rights activist, who has debated  Dannemeyer on television and in other public forums. ""He plays upon people's  fears. . . . Dannemeyer calls himself a conservative and he invokes the mantle  of American ideals, but in fact his ideals are, to my mind, profoundly  un-American. For whatever reason, he holds animus toward a category of  individuals that encompasses millions of Americans. That's not a good thing. .  . .    ""Any individual in a position of power who preaches hatred or intolerance  disserves the American public and promotes social disintegration. It's as  simple as that.""    Dannemeyer and his staff dispute the views that he is on the fringes of  political thought or a bigot.    ""The homosexual activists have said I'm an extremist,"" Dannemeyer said. ""But  the fact of the matter is, my views (on homosexuality) reflect the views of  probably three-fourths of the American people, poll after poll."" He noted that  he won re-election in 1988 his 39th Congressional District, in north central  Orange County, with 74% of the vote.    Dannemeyer ""honestly is one of those guys who just does not hate anybody,"" said  Paul Mero, his press secretary. ""Bill is one, believe it or not, to live and  let live. The problem that he finds is when misbehavior becomes the standard.  He's not willing to put up with that.""    If there is a unifying theme to Dannemeyer's world view, it seems rooted to his  strongly held religious convictions and his belief in moral standards.    ""To us,"" said Mero, a devout Mormon, ""it's those who believe in a God against  those who don't.""    A son of German immigrants, Dannemeyer worked long hours at various jobs after  his father's ill health and the Depression cost the family its livelihood -- a  feed and grain store in West Los Angeles.    He put himself through Valparaiso University, a private Lutheran college in  Valparaiso, Ind., about 45 miles southeast of Chicago, graduated from Hastings  College of Law in San Francisco, and served for two years in the U.S. Army's  counterintelligence corps in West Germany during the mid-1950s.    He met his wife, Evelyn Hoemann, a Lutheran minister's daughter, while living  at a Lutheran hostel in downtown Los Angeles. They have a son and two  daughters.    Over the years, his law practice and real estate investments have made him  comfortable financially, if not wealthy by Orange County standards. On his  latest financial disclosure form, he reported income of at least $80,000 from  real estate holdings in addition to his congressional salary.    When Dannemeyer talks about homosexuality, which he does often, or the need for  gold-backed currency, or Nelson Mandela, he speaks wistfully of the lost values  of small-town America and of an emerging, new society he says has turned its  back on what he calls the Judeo-Christian ethic.    In one of his Mandela speeches, he said: ""These days . . . the world seems  turned on its head. We care more for the rights of criminals than those of  victims. . . . The doctrine of free speech has been extended to obscene art,  flag burners and those who would subvert the Constitution. . . .    ""Forget the right to the pursuit of happiness; you're now entitled to  happiness. And if you can't find it, take it from somebody else.""    In his book, which has sold about 20,000 copies through mail orders, Dannemeyer  echoes the theme.    In earlier times, Dannemeyer writes, homosexuals kept their sex lives private.  ""That was all society really asked of them -- the right not to be affronted by  militant immorality or perversion.""    Now, he continues, ""homosexuals are proclaiming that they will no longer be  satisfied with mere acceptance by society. They are now demanding official  approbation.""    It is Dannemeyer's fight against homosexual activists, and his efforts to enact  federal laws to require doctors to report to public health authorities the  identities of those who are infected with the AIDS virus, that have earned him  the most enmity.    ""Mr. Dannemeyer has an interest in homosexuality that goes beyond that of most  gay people I know,"" said Stoddard. ""I suspect, frankly, only a therapist could  explain it.""    Dannemeyer acknowledges that some believe he is obsessed with homosexuality.    ""It has even been suggested that I must be a homosexual myself, not able to  confront the hellish reality, and hence left to fight my true feelings,"" he  said in a speech on the House floor. ""Let me try to put my work on this issue  into perspective. I am preoccupied with the issue of AIDS and its alter-ego,  homosexuality, like a family physician is preoccupied with a client family. No  attention needs to be paid to a well family. . . . But when disease rears its  ugly head, the family physician is there to help battle the affliction.""    Jacobs, the Indiana congressman who asked for the obscenity investigation, said  he believes Dannemeyer's ""preoccupation with the gays is a fairly sincere one,""  but added: ""I don't think it's entirely fair. . . . If people are dealt that  hand in life and are so enormously unpopular anyway, I don't know that it's  exactly sporting to smack them around.""    But, as with most issues involving Dannemeyer, there is an opposing view. Said  Republican Rep.

WILLIAM DANNEMEYER A BIGOT; OTHERS SAY HE'S A HERO.  ALL AGREE HE NEVER BACKS DOWN, AND ENJOYS A GOOD FIGHT.      By ROBERT W. STEWART, TIMES STAFF WRITER      WASHINGTON      In the packed committee chambers, lawmakers stared in disbelief at Rep. William  E. Dannemeyer, the Orange County Republican with the jutting jaw and ramrod  posture, whose views on the decline of morality in the late 20th Century have  become legend on Capitol Hill.    The House Energy and Commerce Committee had just announced a hard-won  compromise on landmark clean air legislation. Dannemeyer, one of the most  conservative members of Congress, was the first to offer an amendment.    If Congress were going to clean up the nation's air, Dannemeyer told his  colleagues, it ought to go a step further and clean up the nation's airwaves.  The six-term congressman then offered language to establish ""airwave emission  standards"" and $50-million penalties to ensure that television stations do not  broadcast pornographic programs.    Although the amendment was ruled out of order, it prompted one lobbyist to  remark, ""I hadn't seen anything as entertaining since Jim Watt,"" the former  secretary of the interior.    The exercise in political theater came as no surprise to those who have seen  Dannemeyer take the floor of the House of Representatives to lash out at  abortion, moral relativism, the decline of the American greenback, what he says  is the destructive influence of pornography, what he sees as the increasing  power of homosexual activists, what he considers the politicization of the AIDS  epidemic, and, most recently, Nelson Mandela.    Some call Dannemeyer a dangerous bigot. Others dismiss him as irrelevant. But  to many conservatives, he is a genuine hero. And more than a few political  observers who take issue with most of his views say Dannemeyer is a man driven  by sincere religious conviction who acts as a lightning rod for debate on the  most controversial issues of our time.    Just last month, as Washington was warmly welcoming Nelson Mandela, the deputy  president of the African National Congress, Dannemeyer struck again.    In a speech on the House floor the day before Mandela addressed a rare joint  session of Congress, Dannemeyer -- infuriating many people -- denounced the  South African black nationalist, who was recently freed after spending 27 years  in a South African prison, as an unrepentant terrorist and communist.    ""Nelson Mandela is no Martin Luther King,"" Dannemeyer said. ""He is more like H.  Rap Brown or Willie Horton."" Brown was a radical of the 1960s, and Horton is a  convicted murderer who raped a woman while on furlough from a Massachusetts  prison.    In a subsequent speech, Dannemeyer asked: ""What is the difference between  Nelson Mandela and Ethel and Julius Rosenberg,"" the Americans executed in 1953  for passing atomic secrets to the Soviet Union?    ""Mandela pleaded guilty.""    The remarks prompted a spate of outraged letters to the editor and a scathingly  critical column in the Washington Post.    Despite his chosen role as preacher to the House, there is more to Dannemeyer  than his rhetoric. Behind the fire and brimstone, the congressman from  Fullerton is not the relentlessly one-dimensional caricature his critics  sometimes paint.    Dannemeyer's performance before the energy committee, for example, betrayed a  sense of humor so dry it often goes unnoticed. The ""clean airwaves amendment""  was, of course, a serious expression of his alarm over what he perceives to be  the demise of cultural standards.    But it also was a satirical, if deadpan, slap at the clean air bill itself,  legislation Dannemeyer viewed as hopelessly burdensome and complicated. When  the bill finally passed the House, Dannemeyer was one of only 21  representatives who voted against it.    While critics sometimes portray Dannemeyer as a bigot, one liberal Democrat  said he has stood up for the rights of minorities. Rep. Don Edwards (D-San  Jose), who chairs a House Judiciary subcommittee on which Dannemeyer serves,  recalled that Dannemeyer ""was very indignant about the alleged discrimination  against minorities and women in the FBI's hiring. I was pleased. It's to Bill  Dannemeyer's credit.""    There is one Dannemeyer quality that is evident to everyone: Those who love him  and those who loathe him say the former prosecutor and state legislator, born  in South Gate nearly 61 years ago, lives for a good fight.    ""He's a true believer. He's a Lutheran elder who will not shade moral issues,""  said Dannemeyer's comrade-in-arms, Rep. Robert K. Dornan of Garden Grove.    ""If (Dannemeyer) thinks something is immoral, he says it,"" Dornan said. ""There  are precious few people like that in the House.""    One of Dannemeyer's most severe critics -- Thomas B. Stoddard, executive  director of the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, the nation's largest  gay rights group -- put it another way: ""Most politicians avoid controversy  because controversy simply buys trouble. Controversy buys enemies. Mr.  Dannemeyer embraces controversy.""    Dannemeyer concedes the point.    ""I'm a lawyer by profession,"" he said. ""I'm not intimidated by the adversarial  process. I never have been. I've made my living in litigation. I sleep nights.""    A Dannemeyer aide recalled the time his boss recounted to a group of lobbyists  the story of how Dannemeyer, an avid fisherman, had landed a 45-pound grouper  after a wrenching, hourlong tug of war.    ""One of the lobbyists looked up and said, 'You must have been exhausted after  that,' "" recalled Michael G. Franc, Dannemeyer's legislative counsel. ""And  (Dannemeyer) looked at him, and he smiled, and he said, 'Sir, I was  exhilarated.' ""    Almost every public action he takes encourages the view that Dannemeyer gets a  charge out of mixing it up with liberals who are out, in the words of one aide,  to ""ruin America.""    Last summer, Dannemeyer shocked -- and apparently titillated -- many on Capitol  Hill when he inserted into the Congressional Record, the official journal of  congressional proceedings, a lengthy attack on the influence of homosexuals on  federal policy.    The most controversial passage, titled ""What Homosexuals Do,"" recited in  clinical detail ""the average homosexual's favorite activities."" The passage was  so graphic that it prompted Rep. Andrew Jacobs Jr. (D-Ind.) to call for an  ethics committee investigation of Dannemeyer for placing obscene material in  the Record. The committee never took up the request.    Dannemeyer has written a book, published last fall, titled ""Shadow in the  Land."" In it, he asserts that homosexuality ""is not undeniably an inherited  orientation, but is probably a bad habit acquired in early childhood or  puberty."" He also attacks gay rights activists for attempting the wholesale  restructuring of American society by demanding ""special rights,"" and says: ""We  must either defeat militant homosexuality or it will defeat us.""    And there is more to come. Dannemeyer has vowed to push for a floor vote to  expel from Congress Rep. Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat who has  admitted placing on his personal payroll a homosexual prostitute with whom he  once had a sexual relationship.    One of the most liberal members of Congress, Frank also is one of two lawmakers  who have publicly disclosed their homosexuality. (The other is Gerry Studds,  also a Massachusetts Democrat.) The House Committee on Standards of Official  Conduct has struggled with the Frank case for nearly a year.

Opinion polls and candidate lists suggest that Nelson  Mandela  will be State President and F.W. de Klerk and Cyril Ramaphosa  his deputies. Finance Minister is the next most powerful  position. Many in business see Derek Keys as the automatic  choice, but ANC [African National Congress] indications are that  this is by no means certain.    ANC leaders say they would like Mr. Keys in the cabinet of a  government of national unity, but as Minister of Trade and  Industry, not Finance. Would Mr. Keys take the relatively  junior position? Many think not.    The ANC is shopping for a suitable candidate. Outgoing  Nedcor [expansion unknown; a major financial institution] chief  executive Chris Liebenberg is said to have been approached. But  Mr. Liebenberg is believed to have declined because he does not  have political ambitions. Senior ANC people fancy Thabo Mbeki  for the job. But there are suggestions that Mr. Mbeki may be  reluctant to occupy the hot seat at this stage of his career.    What are the ANC objections to Mr. Keys? He has, after all,  done a very good job under extremely difficult circumstances.  There are mutterings that he is too authoritarian and not  sufficiently in tune with the need for investment in human  development. He is also said to be too strongly associated with  the National Party for a senior job in the cabinet. Others say  powerful ANC members, such as Jay Naidoo, who fancies himself as  Minister of Reconstruction, do not want Mr. Keys controlling the  purse strings. One cannot easily imagine Mr. Naidoo telling his  voters that he would like to spend, spend, spend, but Mr. Keys  won't let him.    Can Mr. Keys live with the ANC's reconstruction and  development programme (RDP)? He says it should be subject to  discussion with interested parties in the National Economic  Forum, including government departments.    Opinion polls show Mr. Keys is the favourite among business  people. Agenda-Sacob-Weekly Mail polled 100 businessmen and  found 89 percent support for Mr. Keys as Finance Minister.    ANC economics head Trevor Manuel polled a lowly 4 percent.  Mr. Manuel, 20th on the ANC's election list, and Tito Mboweni  (32nd) are not in the running for top jobs, although deputy  ministerships are possible.    A complicating factor in Mr. Keys' case is that on the  latest  polls the NP will get five cabinet posts, including Deputy  President. With provincial leaders first in line and the NP's  senior negotiators also in with a claim, there are not many  cabinet posts to go around. There is unlikely to be a lot of  ""after you"" going on in the scramble for jobs.    Ultimately, the choice of Finance Minister will be made by  the new President. He will undoubtedly listen closely to his  party and to business. One scenario is that Mr. Mbeki will not  be given a cabinet position, but will be in the President's  office with overall responsibility for implementing the RDP.  This would open the way for Mr. Mandela to appoint Mr. Keys  Minister of Finance. He is, after all, so far ahead of the  others on the election lists that this is a one-horse race.     "
0,FT922-698 ,"FT922-698 _AN-CFZBBACQFT 920626   FT  26 JUN 92 / US probes arms sales      By REUTER      WASHINGTON   THE special prosecutor in the Iran-Contra scandal during the Reagan presidency said yesterday he was investigating whether officials at the 'highest level of the government' broke the law over a 1985 US arms shipment to Iran via Israel, Reuter reports from Washington. Mr Lawrence Walsh said his investigation, which is in its final phase, was expected to be concluded this summer and he had yet to decide on bringing additional criminal charges. The secret White House operation sold arms to Iran in 1985-86, violating an official US trade embargo, to try to win the release of US hostages held in Lebanon. Mr Walsh said in a special report to Congress the alleged cover-up involved inquiries by the presidentially appointed Tower commission, Congress and his own 5 1/2 -year investigation.

Mr Alexandra said talks floundered after a  media statement attributed to ANC President Nelson Mandela  demanded a declaration of assets ahead of the election pact.

Mr Major's office said yesterday he would meet President Nelson Mandela and other members of the South African government on a trip covering Cape Town, Pretoria and Johannesburg. Harold Macmillan was the last British prime minister to visit South Africa, in 1960. In a landmark speech in Cape Town, Macmillan warned the then-Nationalist government that the 'winds of change' were sweeping the African continent as colonies were granted independence by European powers and that its policy of apartheid was out of date.

Established novelist Mary Gordon was a guest on the show. So was critic and  biographer James Atlas. Then there was first-time novelist Jane Vandenburgh.    ""I pronounced myself a Valley girl,"" Vandenburgh says with a grin.    Vandenburgh, who grew up in Northridge, is talking about her performance the  week before on the very highbrow PBS series, ""Bookmark."" She was there plugging  her first novel, ""Failure to Zigzag"" (North Point Press: $16.95), a darkly  funny mother-daughter story set in Southern California in the late '50s and  early '60s.    The appearance on the show, which is hosted by literary heavyweight Lewis  Lapham and is taped in New York, was heady stuff for an author whose first  novel about Southern California was rejected by every publisher she approached  and whose book was finally, miraculously plucked from a slush pile of  unsolicited manuscripts by an editor who not only looked at it, but liked it.    Vandenburgh, who lives now in Oakland, is huddled over breakfast at the Hyatt  Hotel at the airport. She's laughing about the ""Valley girl"" crack and it's not  just because of the show's staid tone. The whole notion is absurd. She's 40,  married to a professor who teaches James Joyce at San Francisco State, where  Jane Vandenburgh earned a master's in creative writing, and has two children,  Noah, 8, and Eva, 4.      Three Years of Mailings    After five years at the typewriter, between editing jobs and raising her  children, Vandenburgh had spent another three years sending her manuscript to  New York publishers and agents. Although she'd once worked as an editor at  Chronicle Books and had contacts in publishing, when it came time to show  agents her novel she decided not to use an agent in her approaches to  publishers. ""I wanted someone to take it for the love of the book.""    A commendable idea, but it didn't work. ""I had 23 rejections of this novel,""  Vandenburgh says, shaking her head. Publishers weren't interested because she  didn't have an agent and only two published short stories to her credit. Agents  weren't interested because she was an unknown writer.    But they were also turned off by Vandenburgh's unsentimental treatment of her  schizophrenic mother character, Katrinka. ""They'd say, 'not for us,' "" recalls  Vandenburgh, who admits she finds her character ""vulgar"" and a terrible mother.    Finally, Vandenburgh submitted the manuscript to North Point, the prestigious  small literary press in Berkeley. And though it languished there in the pile  for six months, when editor Kate Moses picked it out and read it she  immediately fell in love with it.    Vandenburgh figures the chances of her manuscript being accepted there were ""1  in 32,000."" And the fact that it was still seems to astound her. ""I don't  believe in God, but I do believe in North Point.""    It's a version that Lisa Ross, subsidiary rights director at North Point, does  not dispute. ""What is clear about this book is it seems somehow blessed, in  that it's beating the odds in publishing. The odds for an unagented manuscript  to be read and accepted are so extraordinarily low that just its publication is  a small miracle.      Strong Characters    ""It actually became a cause celebre in-house,"" Ross says. ""The characters are  so strong and the language is so fun and unusual, everyone was speaking like  Katrinka. It was a book that everybody felt special about.""    Though it's too soon to tell, Ross believes the novel has the potential to be a  strong seller. Avon has already set a floor for the paperback rights at  $30,000, and 12 houses are in the bidding. Beyond that, ""it's being very  well-reviewed,"" Ross says. ""Jane is appearing on 'Bookmark,' and for them to  focus on a first novel is very unusual. Also, there's a lot of movie interest.  We have two option offers, and I think we'll be receiving more. It's very much  a word-of-mouth book as well. People read it and are so enthusiastic they tell  all their friends about it. So that's a good sign for the book as well.""    For her part, Vandenburgh feels vindicated -- by the publication, some  favorable reviews, a positive response from readers, the movie offers. (Bette  Midler is interested, but Vandenburgh would like to see Tracey Ullman play  Katrinka.)    ""People seem to like Katrinka,"" she says, sounding somewhat surprised. ""They  don't say, she's a bad woman, a bad mother. I think we all have our  Katrinka-esque days, especially those of us who are mothers and aspire to some  kind of artistic career.""    If you crossed Lucy Ricardo with Blanche Dubois, she'd come out acting pretty  much like Katrinka. She's an alcoholic and a ventriloquist, and she talks  loudly in public and calls her auditory hallucinations ""Space Radio."" Her idea  of cuisine is a loaf of French bread stuffed with an ear of corn and drowned in  canned peaches or a mayonnaise and olive sandwich. Her idea of housework is to  pile all the laundry in the sink and let it ferment.      Survival Attempts    The story basically revolves around her daughter Charlotte's efforts to survive  this. And, for that matter, to survive the repressive rantings of her equally  nutty maternal grandparents, Lionel and Winnie, with whom she lives when  Katrinka's locked up in Camarillo State Hospital.    Vandenburgh's own childhood was more like ""Father Knows Best"" meets ""The Brady  Bunch."" A fourth-generation Californian, and one of eight children, Vandenburgh  comes from a family of ""staid, pretentious Republicans."" (Who aren't all that  different from her characters Winnie and Lionel, she notes wryly.) Her mother  was a housewife, her father an executive with Lockheed, and most of her  relatives lived in Orange, Glendale and Redondo Beach -- places that also  figure prominently in her book.      From Vivid Memories    Her vivid memories of growing up here and her interest in California history  led her to write about Southern California. Lionel, for instance, a former  successful banker who lost everything in the '29 crash, is obsessed with Bank  of America founder A. P. Giannini. He lies on the couch all day, reading and  rereading the same Charles Dickens books, going to the phone ""believing it  might be some powerful banker -- A. P. Giannini? . . . who was calling him  home.""    There's also a strong indication that this rock-ribbed Republican, this  teetotaler who harangues Charlotte about the dangers of ""drink,"" may be a child  molester. It's all part of Vandenburgh's take on sinister California. ""I  believe a lot of scoundrels ended up here,"" she says, ""people who were far  removed from the structures of a more extended family. Did Katrinka really go  to bed with her father? I don't know. But I think that typically does happen  when the family is shorn away. Lionel and Winnie don't work, they don't go out,  so there's no one to make them face up to what they're doing.""      Interest in Ventriloquism    Katrinka did not arise out of Vandenburgh's own experience, but from an  interest in writing about a ventriloquist. But she was also inspired by her  view of the ""downside"" of Lucy Ricardo.    Of Lucy and similar Lucille Ball roles, Vandenburgh recalls, ""We were supposed  to think she was very funny. I remember sitting in the theater as a kid, seeing  her in this movie 'The Long Long Trailer,' with this trailer swinging out all  over the road, and it was awful. It was sort of a metaphor for housekeeping,  trying to be the good 1950s housewife.""    A more recent inspiration, she said, is all the adults her age who constantly  complain about their parents. Practically everyone in Berkeley is in either AA  or Al-Anon, she groans, and it's ""all this sort of whining,"" and, taking the  line from a Woody Allen movie, she'd like to tell them ""Just grow up!"" That's  one reason she wanted to write about schizophrenia: to show the ""monumental  hurdles in each child's life.""    Not surprisingly, ""dealing with these characters"" made it a tough book to  write, ""even though I have a feeling Charlotte is going to make it.""    Vandenburgh strongly believed in Katrinka when everyone else didn't. Everyone,  that is, except her husband, who thought the book was hilarious, and a friend  who'd take her out to lunch every time she rewrote the book. And it was that  faith that kept her going.    Vandenburgh has completed the second draft of her second novel called ""The  Physics of Sunset."" It's about an architect in Berkeley. In the meantime, she's  savoring the success of Katrinka.    ""I'm so delighted people think this comic monster is funny. It makes me feel  other people out there have my same sick sense of humor.""

In September, Nigeria's central bank said swindlers using Nigerian names had extorted millions of dollars from people in America, Asia and Europe under the guise of transferring cash. Mr Osayande gave no details of the latest fraud.  The Financial Times   London Page 4  "

0,FT944-12972 ,"FT944-12972 _AN-EJ3AVADSFT 941029   FT  29 OCT 94 / The Markets: You'll pay - even if you weren't conned - Serious Money      By GILLIAN O'CONNOR, Personal Finance Editor   An unsung victim of the latest great pensions scandal could be . . . you. Of course, the worst hit are the hundreds and thousands of people who were advised wrongly to buy personal pensions. But the bill for compensation - estimated at up to Pounds 2bn - will be footed partly by other life insurance and pension policyholders. Here is how the chain works. Liability for recompense falls either on the independent financial adviser or on the life insurance company if the sale was made by a life company salesman or appointed rep. But where does the life insurance company go for money? For mutual companies, the only source is the life insurance fund, which is wholly owned by holders of its life insurance and pension policies. Companies with shareholders can go both to policyholders and to shareholders. If they fund the compensation payments from the life fund, roughly 90 per cent will normally come from policyholders and the other 10 per cent from shareholders - and they could also go direct to shareholders. All the figures involved are so notional at the moment that there is no point in trying to work out the impact of the compensation payments on individual companies. There are around Pounds 300bn of life funds. So, even if the whole of the compensation were the responsibility of the life companies (very unrealistic), the compensation still would be less than 1 per cent of assets. Some companies may take a bigger hit. What is more, the fresh cash drain comes at a time when life insurance payouts on with-profit policies are falling and are likely to drop further. Many industry experts reckon that far too many life insurance companies are still paying out much more than can be justified by their investment returns  -and running down their safety margins fast. So, policyholders will, yet again, pay for the mistakes of insurance management - as they have already over the disastrous forays into estate agency by some life companies. The innocent winner in the personal pension scandal is British industry. Company pension schemes have benefited from the improved solvency produced by the opt-outs - people who were persuaded to leave a company scheme even though they still worked at the company, or advised to buy a personal pension rather than join the company scheme. Meanwhile, the employers themselves have benefited both from this and from the drop in the number of employees for whom they need to make contributions. A large number of companies have enjoyed several years of pension 'holidays' during which they have not needed to pay in to the pension fund. Opt-outs are not the main reason for the pension surpluses which allowed companies to take these holidays, but they will have helped in some cases. A less innocent winner is the government - which enjoys the same benefits as any other employer. It is arguable that it is no more responsible for ill-advised opt-outs than any other employer. But the next pension scandal to break will be over the state earnings-related pension scheme (Serps), where the government actually bribed people to trade in part of their state pension for a personal plan. Now for a couple of books for the very serious stock market investor. Both are potentially useful but both are hard work. The first is for people who want to understand not just what company accounts are trying to tell shareholders - but what they are trying to conceal. Interpreting Company Reports and Accounts*, by Holmes and Sugden, is in its fifth edition and remains the best way to learn about  - if not to love - the subject. The authors use real company examples, first to set out how all the items in accounts work and then to explain how investment analysts use them. The section on accounting loopholes is getting smaller, though. This is sad for the reader, since it was the most fun, but the shrinkage reflects good news for shareholders at large: the scope for financial sophistry is getting smaller. The other 'book' serves the investor who has a working knowledge of accounts but prefers to let other people crunch most of his numbers, while he concentrates on looking for that handful of shares worth buying. Publisher Hemmington Scott has used its extensive data base to produce a company handbook tailored to the requirements of former financier Jim Slater. Company Refs** is a touch gimmicky but provides a diversity of investment yardsticks for all the companies in the FT-SE-A All-Share index. The main book is divided by company. The second slices companies by stock market sector, investment classification, attributes such as yield, and even the likelihood of companies being promoted to one of the main indexes such as the FT-SE 100. The third explains how to use the system Would anyone actually invest just on the basis of comparative analysis done with the help of Company Refs? Probably not. An intelligent investor would use it to get or confirm ideas - then send off for a set of company accounts and sweat through the numbers himself with Holmes and Sugden. Not for the faint-hearted. * Woodhead-Faulkner: Pounds 34.95. ** Subscription costs Pounds 475 a year for monthly updates; Pounds 175 for a quarterly service. Hemmington Scott - 0171-278-7769.

By ROBERT GLASS, ASSOCIATED PRESS      ST. JOHNS, Antigua      A scandal over the shipment of Israeli arms to a Colombian drug lord has become  a political bombshell in this tourist haven, where the ruling family has  weathered previous scandals.    The island gained international notoriety in the late 1970s for allowing the  testing of weapons for South Africa. It was in the news again in the early  1980s for harboring fugitive American financier Robert Vesco.    Now, Israel has accused Prime Minister Vere Bird's eldest son, Vere Jr., 54, of  ordering weapons for Antigua's 80-man army that mysteriously ended up in the  hands of Colombia's Medellin drug cartel.    Vere Jr., a Cabinet minister, has denied wrongdoing but resigned his Cabinet  post pending the outcome of a judicial inquiry, the equivalent of a U.S. grand  jury investigation.    Another son of the prime minister, Lester, 52, deputy prime minister and  sometime rival of his older brother, is spearheading the local investigation,  shrugging off any possible conflict of interest.    The Bird family, which has dominated the island's politics for more than three  decades and grown wealthy while doing it, has long been accused of corruption  in connection with developing the island's booming tourist industry. But this  affair, with its suggestion of a government link with the sinister world of  international drug trafficking and gunrunning, is a bombshell by comparison.    ""This latest one shocked us to the core,"" said Anglican Archbishop Orland  Lindsay.    Tim Hector, a leftist opposition leader, said he thought the nation could be in  danger of a coup if the prime minister's son were charged.    ""I believe we are teetering on the brink . . . of a possible military seizure  of power and control by Vere Bird (Jr.),"" he said. Vere Jr. is said to command  the army's loyalty.    In April, Israel said it had shipped weapons to the Caribbean island in April,  1989, on the understanding they would be used exclusively by the Antigua  Defense Force.    Israel said the arms were ordered by Vere Jr., who identified himself as the  minister of national security. No such ministry exists, but Vere Jr. acts  informally as his father's national security adviser.    The Antiguan investigation determined that the weapons arrived here on April  24, 1989, and were shipped the same day to Santa Marta, Colombia.    Colombian officials say soldiers found 232 Israeli-made weapons in February  during a search of ranches seized from Gonzalo Rodrigues Gacha, a reputed  kingpin of the Medellin cartel who was killed in a December gun battle with  police.    The weapons included machine guns, submachine guns, assault rifles, pistols,  shoulder-fired rockets and infrared night scopes.    The Outlet, a weekly newspaper published by Hector's Antigua Caribbean  Liberation Movement, said the weapons deal was arranged by two Israelis,  Maurice Sarfati and Col. Yair Klein.    Sarfati, a former Israeli army officer, once operated a melon farm in Antigua  but went bankrupt and reportedly is being sought by U.S. authorities for  defaulting on $1.3 million in loans.    Colombian officials have accused Klein, a reserve officer in the Israeli army,  of organizing, training and equipping paramilitary groups, and declared him a  fugitive from justice.    Klein said in Israel that the arms shipment was originally intended for a  training school he wanted to set up in Antigua for Panamanian rebels opposed to  Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, who was ousted by U.S. forces last December.    When plans for the school fell through, Klein said, the Panamanians wanted the  weapons shipped to Panama, but somehow they were diverted to Colombia.    Many questions remain, among them whether anyone in the Antiguan government was  aware the arms shipment was headed for Colombia.    In Antigua, a former British colony of 80,000 only nine miles wide and 12 miles  long, the government is largely a function of one family, the Birds.    Vere Bird Sr., the 80-year-old prime minister, rose to prominence in the 1930s  as a union organizer in the days of colonial sugar plantations and has led the  nation all but five of the last 34 years. His Antigua Labor Party controls 15  of the 17 seats in Parliament.    Vere Jr. is minister of public works and communication. Lester, the deputy  prime minister, is leader of the ruling party and minister of foreign affairs,  economic development, tourism and energy.    Antiguans take it for granted that either Lester or Vere Jr. will succeed their  father, who is in declining health, and many believe the outcome of this  scandal could help settle the matter.    The brothers, both British-trained lawyers, have weathered previous scandals.    In 1987, Vere Jr. was implicated, but never charged, in an investigation of a  government project to repave the runway of the island's airport. He had formed  a private company to carry out the project, which was supposed to cost no more  than $3.5 million but ended up costing $11.5 million.    It was Lester who helped Vesco when the fugitive surfaced in Antigua in 1982  with a bizarre plan to buy half of Barbuda, Antigua's small sister island, and  establish a principality called the Sovereign Order of New Aragon.    Vere Jr. is widely regarded as his father's favorite. Lester, who was an  All-American long jumper at the University of Michigan in 1960, is seen as the  brighter of the two.    In separate interviews, the brothers played down their rivalry and the possible  impact of the scandal on their political futures.    ""I clearly had no intention of . . . reducing (this matter) to a question of a  fight for power within the domestic situation,"" Lester said. ""After all, he is  still my brother.""    Vere Jr. would not discuss specifics of the case, but said: ""I've never been  associated with anything of the kind and would never be.""    About his relationship with his brother, he said: ""Whenever I meet him, it's a  most amicable . . . relationship. When we leave, I don't know what transpires.""

Deputy President de Klerk and myself have formed a  disciplinary subcommittee, and in order to cover my back, he is  going to chair the subcommittee.    Ladies and gentlemen, we as South Africans -- and I think,  indeed, the world -- are very proud to have a person such as  Nelson Mandela. [applause] I think it is true that among  ourselves as South Africans, and among the peoples of the world,  regardless of our political beliefs, of our differences in other  ways, I think we all see ourselves reflected in his glory, and  it is a glory that arises from his humility. It is a glory that  arises from his sense of forgiveness. It is glory that arises  from his sensitivity to human suffering. It is a glory that  arises from his commitment to principle. Ladies and gentlemen,  Nelson Mandela. [applause]    [Mandela] Many forces have influenced the history of our  country, as they have done in the history of other countries.  The workers, traditional leaders, and tribesmen from the  countryside, educationists, economists, businessmen, religious  leaders, all have played a role in our history.    But for one or two moments I want to talk about two forces  which have been of particular relevance in the history of our  country. We are aware of the type of government we have had  since 1912 which relied on brute force and coercion. The many  decades of that coercion only served to produce the Mbekis, the  Sisulus, the Joe Slovos, the Brahm Fishers, the Dadoos, the  Nickers, the Trevor Manuels, and they have become national  heroes today, and some of them are now holding cabinet posts.  They prevailed after a lot of bitterness had been created, and  it is as a result of that policy that deep wounds have been  created in our country. Coercion, brute force, impatience, the  inability to sit down with your countrymen and to talk had the  hand in another force, that of compassion, that of love and  loyalty to your country, that of ignoring what is negative in a  human being and concentrating on that which is good. Through  dialogue, through persuasion, we have been able to bring South  Africa out of that era of darkness, bitterness, pessimism, to a  moment where the entire world has joined us to come and  celebrate.    That is a lesson, not just for this day. It is a lesson on  which we can build for the future. Perhaps it was fortunate  that we had this era, because we are now able to appreciate the  sacrifices that have been made by the Sisulus and the Mbekis and  the others. We now know the caliber of the men and women of  South Africa. South Africa is rich, and not only in natural  wealth and gold, it is rich in the caliber of its men and women.  We appreciate that and we have come to appreciate more because  of the struggle that they have put forward.    But there is another aspect from the opposite direction.  Among those who have been produced by apartheid there have been  men and women with a vision who realized that human beings are  human beings. I spent so many years in prison -- you will be  surprised to know the friendships, the strong friendships which  were built between black prisoners and white warders. It was  difficult for the policy makers to persecute us as they wanted  because we became friends with the warders in our passage. It  is through them that we could be persecuted, and the firm  friendships we formed were itself a protection.    I don't know whether my friends are here. I invited three of  the warders who looked after me to attend these celebrations. I  invited them...I invited them to come--or rather, I asked the  committee that is arranging to invite them to come, because I  wanted them to share in the joys that have emanated  spontaneously around this day, because in a way they also  contributed to it.    Then, of course, there is my friend Mr. de Klerk. He  had...he was one of those who gave us a hard time. The late Dr.  Danie Craven, the chairman of the South African Rugby Board, and  Dr. Luyt, the chairman, I think, of the Southern Transvaal Rugby  Board, they went to Harare to see the ANC, because they realized  that South African rugby could not go back to international  sport without going through the ANC. They knew that the key to  international rugby was ANC. They did a good thing. It was good  for them, they had foresight. They suppressed all their  prejudices and realized that this is the organization that would  help them. When they came back they were chastised by Mr. de  Klerk for having had discussions with a terrorist organization.  Now I mention this as a measure of the change here undergone,  the personal courage, the vision, the honesty, the integrity  with which he came to examine the situation in South Africa and  used his enormous power as the head of the government to bring  about reforms.    So we have forgotten the past. We must know the past so that  when we work together now in a government of national unity we  must know precisely what we have come through, what we should  avoid.    We said a lot of unkind things about one another during the  election [laughter], but we have fought the election. We have  had a good fight. Now it is the time for us to put together the  broken pieces of our country and to ensure that our people speak  with one voice. We feel that because of the many years of  discussions we have had before I was released from jail -- I had  meetings with them. [sentence as heard] We discussed the  situation together, and then during these four years, we have  exchanged on a wide variety of very sensitive issues. When our  own teams could not agree, we sat down together and exchanged  views. I took him into confidence about some of the problems  that I had. He took me in confidence about the problems that he  had, and we worked as a team behind the scenes, [applause] and  we were able to keep together at one time 26 political parties  with different backgrounds, pulling in different directions.    Today is the result of that other force in our country --  that of persuasion, that of discussing, that of dialogue, that  of love and loyalty to our common fatherland. Now in the days  to come, this is the force on which we are going to rely. We  are still going to have many problems because when Mr. de Klerk  talks about a democracy sometimes he doesn't mean the same thing  which I understand about democracy. [laughter] And when our own  people, when we talk about a government of national unity, which  now must fight for reconciliation, for nation building, they  don't understand the same thing which he understands. Sometimes  we don't understand the same thing which I understand.  [laughter] So the government of national unity has to face all  these problems. But I have no doubt that we have men and women  in this country from all sections of the population who will  rise to the challenge.    There are many Americans here. Perhaps let me repeat what I  have said in their absence, because this comes from an American  who is alive today. And those who have been with me in the  meetings I have addressed must plug their ears because they will  be bored to hear this again. Some American has said a person  who does what all others can do, is an ordinary person. A  person who does what no other person can do, is exceptional.  But a person who does what no other person has ever done, is a  national asset, is a genius, is an institution.    South Africa today wants men and women who strive to do what  no other person has done. We require this for our country. It  is your wish -- everyone of you -- that when your last days on  earth come, we should be able to say: Here lies the man or  woman who has done his or her duty on earth; and if you strive  to do what no other person has done, we will be able to say:  Here lies a person who did his duty on earth. I thank you.     "

The Tokyo-based brokerage will return Ryoko Securities' Swiss licence on July 20. The move stems from shrinking primary and brokerage business in Switzerland, and to ensure help in underpinning cost-cutting in Japan. Three Japanese second-tier securities companies paid Y9.8bn to compensate clients' losses from securities trading during the two years to March 1992, according to the Finance Ministry.

One example is the suit for the  incredible sum of 2 billion won against Hangyore  Sinmun. It was published in an article on the disclosure  made in a press interview by Chong Chae-chung---who alleged the  president's son, Kim Hyon-chol, said that he was involved in the  bribery scandal involving the lobbying money of an unlicensed  oriental-medicines company. This was at the time of the 14th  presidential election.    Citizens from all walks of life uniformly applaudeding the  courage of Hangyore Sinmum by giving statements,  calling, or visiting the newspaper company, and criticizing this  irrational attack on the press is also reminiscent of the  atmosphere of society during the past era of authoritarianism.  The ""stubborn silence"" of others in the media---who had been  raising their voices on various events, but had to take care  concerning this incident---also resembled the media of the past,  ever servile before the powerful.    Through an editorial about the lobbying-money scandal  involving the government and the center of power, Hangyore  Sinmun has already pointed out the excessive abuse of power  and immorality shown by this response. To reiterate, the first  thing the Blue House should do concerning this incident is to  reveal the truth sincerely and in detail, apologize for what it  should be sorry for, and punish those who deserve it. Yet, the  response of those in power, at least in the eyes of the public,  has been to make economic threats and force the one who made  the revelation to withdraw it. This is done by bringing criminal  charges against the one who divulged the scandal, by applying  ""pressure"" to the media not to report the information made  public through an interview, and, concerning Hangyore  Sinmun's report of this, by filing a suit for an outrageous  amount.    Given this situation, no matter what words the Blue House  mobilizes to explain itself, it will not be able to convince the  public. According to the public's understanding of this  incident, when Chong Chae-chung, just an ordinary man, stood  against the powerful, criticizing the president's son, who is  reported to have great political influence, he would not have  told groundless lies.    Holding an emergency joint meeting of the Seoul-Area Press  Labor Union Chairmen's Group [Ollonsa Nojowiwonjangdan] last  December, the National Alliance of Press Labor Unions [Chonguk  Ollon Nodong Chohap Yonmaeng] [NAPLU] characterized the suit by  Kim Hyon-chol as a ""new media-control measure,"" and decided to  oppose this head-on. This was a natural decision made out of  deep concern for the arrogant posture of those in power and for  a [possible] return to the government-media relationship of the  past. The NAPLU announced that it would set out on a  reporter-petition drive, demanding a Blue House explanation of  the political-funding bribery incident and an end to the  oppression of the media. The question of to what extent the  labor union chairmen who made this decision and the reporters  responding to the petition drive will be able to return each to  their respective companies and realize the purpose of this  resolution through the printed page will become the standard for  measuring where we in the press now stand. The unified might of  the media is truly a powerful weapon for beating back the  oppression of the media by those in power and is the most  certain ally of the true democratization and genuine reform of  society.

0,FT932-14422 ,"FT932-14422 _AN-DDSCSADMFT 930419   FT  19 APR 93 / Ultra-right suspected of Hani assassination: Evidence of plot to hold up democracy in S Africa      By PATTI WALDMEIR      JOHANNESBURG   TENS OF thousands of grieving South African blacks paid their last respects yesterday to assassinated guerrilla leader Mr Chris Hani, as evidence emerged that his death may have been part a rightwing conspiracy to destabilise democracy talks. Mr Hani, idolised by township blacks as one of the greatest heroes of their liberation struggle, lay in state throughout the day in an open casket at a soccer stadium outside Soweto. As the 30,000-strong crowd sang songs in praise of Umkhonto we Sizwe (Spear of the Nation), the African National Congress military wing, ANC leaders filed past the coffin of the man who once commanded Umkhonto in exile. Some touched the body which was dressed in military fatigues and surrounded by flowers. Female mourners wept. The elder statesmen of the ANC, former leader Mr Oliver Tambo and long-time political prisoner Mr Walter Sisulu, led the sad cortege. Mr Nelson Mandela viewed the body last night. After an all-night vigil at the stadium, Mr Hani's body will be buried later today in the mainly white, working-class town of Boksburg, where he was shot by a white assassin on April 10. It will be one of the largest political events ever in South Africa, and may spark clashes between white residents and black mourners. As Boksburg residents prepared for today's funeral, barricading homes and drafting in friends to protect their property, police were interrogating a prominent rightwing white, Mr Clive Derby-Lewis, who they said was a suspect in Mr Hani's assassination. Mr Derby-Lewis is a leading figure in the Conservative party, the official parliamentary opposition, and member of the advisory President's Council, part of the government's executive branch. Mr Derby-Lewis regularly made news headlines for his racist comments, including an incident in 1989 when he commented, 'what a pity' on hearing that an aircraft had braked to avoid a black man on the runway at Johannesburg airport. His arrest raises fears that the murder was part of a conspiracy which extends well beyond the lunatic white fringe - the other suspect, Mr Janusz Walus, is a member of the ultra-right neo-Nazi group, the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging (Afrikaner Resistance Movement) - to the top of the rightwing establishment. Political analysts say the involvement of the Conservative party, which polled 800,000 votes in last year's white referendum, is far more worrying than that of the AWB, an militarist organisation which has vowed to carry out what it calls the 'Third Boer War' against blacks. As well as Mr Derby-Lewis, police were holding a second rightwing supporter, who murdered two black protesters on Saturday. The murder of Mr Hani has proved a strategic coup for the ultra-right. Resulting violence has pushed whites further to the right, weakening the ruling National party; and the ultra-right has lost its inactive image. However, the ANC says it will continue to negotiate with the Conservative party and the transition to democracy seems likely to be accelerated as a result.

As he was leaving  for South Africa to take part in the inauguration ceremony,  Buwayz clarified that Lebanon's relations with this country have  been normal and natural since it eliminated racism. However,  the application of this decision requires some time. We have  this report from our colleague Darwish 'Ammar from Beirut  airport:    [Begin recording] ['Ammar] Mr. Buwayz, you leave today for  South Africa to take part in President Nelson Mandela's  inauguration ceremony. What would you like to say on this  occasion with regard to Lebanon's participation in this ceremony?    [Buwayz] Of course, the election and inauguration of  President Mandela after the historic reforms in South Africa are  considered an international, nay, even historic event. This is  so because of the developments that have taken place there and  also because of the effects of this development on the political  and humanitarian level. By this I mean the cancellation of  racial discrimination and openness toward democracy and freedom.  There is no doubt that Lebanon should not stay away from this  event. It should not be kept away from the significance of this  event, both from the aspect of democracy, freedom, and  coexistence, and from the aspect of the extensive historic and  ancient Lebanese presence in South Africa, where there is a  large Lebanese community.    Proceeding from this, the visit on this occasion acquires a  special character. Therefore, Lebanon had to attend this  international celebration.    ['Ammar] When will the Arab League's resolution on ending  the boycott of South Africa come into effect in Lebanon?    [Buwayz] The resolution to cancel the boycott is a decision  that was made in the Arab League during the last session over a  month ago. The Lebanese Council of Ministers applied this  resolution in the session before last by canceling all aspects  of the political, economic, and trade boycott. Thus, relations  now between Lebanon and South Africa are natural and very normal.    ['Ammar] Will there be diplomatic representation between the  two countries?    [Buwayz] We now have a general consulate there. We have  made the decision to normalize diplomatic relations. Of course,  the implementation of this decision requires some material and  financial support which might not be available immediately.    ['Ammar] On the sidelines of the visit to South Africa, will  you hold meetings with the participants in the inauguration  ceremony such as representatives of various countries taking  part in the ceremony?    [Buwayz] As with every international meeting of this  caliber, the celebration will include a large number of heads of  state, prime ministers, and foreign ministers. This event might  provide the opportunity for side meetings with some officials.    ['Ammar] During your stopover in Paris, will you hold talks  and meetings in the French capital?    [Buwayz] No. Our stopover in Paris is purely mechanical.    ['Ammar] Mr. Minister, there are some rumors about a  possibility of your visiting the United States. Will you be  going to the United States?    [Buwayz] I was supposed to visit Florida in response to an  invitation from the University of Florida to deliver a lecture  on Lebanon and the peace process here. However, some events  have made me change my plans. It has been postponed to an as  yet unspecified date. [end recording]     "

0,FT932-4311 ,"FT932-4311 _AN-DFJB6AATFT 930610   FT  10 JUN 93 / Gonzalez back into battle - with his own party      By PETER BRUCE      MADRID   PRIME MINISTER Felipe Gonzalez of Spain, fresh from his triumph in Sunday's general election, is being thrown quickly back into a battle for control of his Socialist party, the outcome of which could make or break his fourth term in office. The row, buried during the election campaign, has resurfaced as Mr Gonzalez prepares sweeping cabinet changes and tries to decide with which parties his minority government will make policy arrangements solid enough to allow him to govern for a full term. The infighting, which became public two days after the election, is between supporters of Mr Gonzalez, politically centrist or liberal, and the left-wing party machine, suspicious of the conservative drift of government policies and led by Mr Alfonso Guerra, party vice president and former deputy prime minister. Mr Gonzalez inclines towards making a four-year pact with the conservative Catalan CiU while the Guerristas, fearful that Catalan fiscal rectitude might damage their influence over the budget, prefer rolling pacts, with the government siding with different parties on different issues. Mr Gonzalez has to solve this. He is head of both the government and the party but was unable earlier this year to force party administrators to accept responsibility for a scandal over illicit party financing. The ensuing row, during which Mr Guerra and his associates attacked the liberals for calling themselves 'renovators who are renovators of nothing', threatened to split the party and forced Mr Gonzalez to call the election. While Mr Gonzalez was taking a post-election break in Andalucia on Tuesday, Mr Guerra said on television that while much of the credit was due to Mr Gonzalez for the Socialists' surprisingly strong performance on Sunday - in which they lost their parliamentary majority but ended well ahead of the conservative People's party - the party took a great deal of credit, too. By that, he meant himself. He and his supporters point out that the big Socialist vote was concentrated in the left-wing strongholds of Andalucia and Extremadura and that he produced a huge Socialist vote in his own constituency, Seville. The Socialists also increased their vote in the Basque country, which strengthens Mr Guerra's close party aide, Mr Jose Maria Benegas, who heads the Basque Socialists Most analysts agree that if Mr Gonzalez does not manage to redesign the party executive - perhaps at a party congress to be held next January at the latest - he will find it difficult to implement the austere fiscal policies necessary to help Spain survive its current recession. He also needs to address the party financing scandal much sooner, before it gets to the courts. Any credible way out involves finding new positions for Mr Guerra and Mr Benegas, both of whom would resist fiercely any pressure to leave their posts. To get their hands off the party levers, Mr Gonzalez may even try to bring one or both of them into his next government. But the big public test of strength between Mr Gonzalez and Mr Guerra will come in about three weeks when the parties select their parliamentary spokesmen. The current pro-Guerra Socialist incumbent is likely to be removed and there is speculation that Mr Gonzalez wants to replace him with Mr Carlos Solchaga, finance minister, who is deeply resented by the left.

Speaking at Ulundi, Dr. Buthelezi said there needed to be a  constructive relationship between provincial and central  government.    His remarks are seen by observers as dispelling fears that  he  would not take part in the government of national unity, in  which it is now speculated that he may occupy one of three IFP  cabinet posts.

But it stopped short of blaming senior ANC officials for the abuses, writes Patti Waldmeir in Johannesburg. In a report released yesterday, a three-man commission appointed by ANC president Nelson Mandela echoed criticisms from an earlier internal commission of inquiry, saying that ANC security officers had beaten, tortured, detained without trial, and in some cases executed detainees. But it named only two senior ANC officials and accused them of relatively minor abuses. More serious findings were made against members of the ANC's security branch, and the commission recommends that they be disciplined under the ANC's internal code of conduct.

NTT's shares reached a price of more than Y3m each in mid-1987, soon after the company was converted from a government monopoly to a private corporation, but closed yesterday at 640,000 yen. Since the group's privatisation Tokyo stocks have fallen, NTT has been hit by a bribery scandal and investors' interest in the telecommunications sector has fallen.

While Mr Takeshita has faced heavy public criticism for his alleged links to gangsters and a more recent corruption scandal involving a gold leaf screen, back in Shimane prefecture, his local constituency in western Japan, he is still a hero. 'I know he'll get in,' says Mr Yutaka Adachi, who proudly says he is the same age as Mr Takeshita - 69. Shimane is a typical rural constituency. The sparsely populated region is represented by five MPs in the lower house, the same as a crowded urban district. For as long as people can remember, four out of the five seats have been held by the ruling Liberal Democratic party, and the benefits are brazenly apparent. The prefecture has the highest annual public works spending per capita. However, the political upheaval triggered by the no-confidence vote which brought down the government of Mr Kiichi Miyazawa has also reached this traditionally conservative region. Mr Atsushi Nishikori, a 42-year-old candidate, is running for the New Harbinger Party, a splinter group from the LDP. Mr Takeshita, running as an independent because of LDP worries that his tarnished image would hurt the party, is facing one of the toughest election campaigns in his 35-year political career. He has been forced to run an unusually thorough campaign, holding meetings with his electorate for the first time in 24 years. He is aware of the opinion polls, where about 70 per cent of Japanese wanted Mr Takeshita's resignation, and is copying the exhaustive campaign tactics of his political mentor Mr Kakuei Tanaka, after he was indicted over a financial scandal in the 1970s. For the past week, Mr Takeshita has been driving through more than 20 towns and villages a day, speaking to groups of 30 to 60 supporters. Mr Takeshita looks relaxed, speaking in his hometown Shimane dialect, but he also feels the need to justify his past actions and blame the scandals on the media. He defends himself against claims that he had used gangster links to silence an extreme right-wing group which had mounted a 'praise to death' campaign against him in 1987 before his elevation to the premiership. 'I couldn't sue the Kominto (the right-wing group) because they were praising me,' he says in front of an audience of 30 in a hall in Hakuta, a village in the mountains. He also tells supporters that the scandal surrounding the sale of a gold leaf screen, the sale proceeds of which were allegedly given to politicians, including a secretary to Mr Takeshita, was 'made up by the media.' After apologising for the 'great sorrow caused among his friends back home,' he clenches his fist, claiming he has a mission to find the truth behind the scandal. Supporters listen intently to Mr Takeshita's recollections of the six summit meetings of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations he attended as finance minister or prime minister. 'I have many friends abroad,' he says, stressing his role as an elder statesman. Mr Takeshita expresses his concern for the environment, implying that he had proposed the earth summit in Rio last year. He does not fail to add his support to political reform. 'It's the sign of the times and I'd like to contribute what I can through my experience as a politician,' he says. After the 20-minute speech, Mr Takeshita leaves the modern village hall in the middle of the rice paddies. 'It's the media's fault that the LDP is having such a hard time,' says supporter Mr Adachi. With the help of Mr Shin Kanemaru, the disgraced former kingmaker of the LDP, Mr Takeshita led the largest faction within the party, but was forced to resign as prime minister in 1989 due to his involvement in the Recruit stock-for-favours scandal. However, even after Recruit, thanks to the vast supporter network and corporate votes from local construction companies, he managed to win the most votes in the prefecture. Elsewhere in the region, Mr Yoshio Sakurauchi, the 81-year-old former speaker of the lower house, who has represented Shimane for more than 40 years, calls through the loudspeakers for support. Although his age limits his campaigning to waving through the rice paddies from his van, and brief speeches in front of small local train stations, supporters rush out of their houses to cheer him on. Such deep-rooted support for the LDP has prevented NHP's Mr Nishikori from overtly criticising Mr Takeshita, although to many Japanese he is a symbol of political corruption. Mr Toshio Harada, head of Mr Nishikori's support group, says that some Shimane voters have come to realise that the prefecture is now the centre of the nation's attention. While national criticism of the old ways of Japanese politicking has heightened during the last few days of the election campaign, most Shimane voters expect Mr Takeshita to be elected. 'He still has very strong links with construction groups, who will give him the organised vote,' says Mr Kiyomi Osawa, a middle-aged office worker. However that is not the only reason he is likely to be re-elected. 'I don't care what the media says, Mr Takeshita is good for Shimane,' says a farmer, gazing at a newly road stretching towards the mountains.   Countries:-  JPZ  Japan, Asia.

Early results in South Africa's first all-race elections gave President FW de Klerk's white-led National party a commanding 30 per cent lead over Mr Nelson Mandela's largely black African National Congress in the Western Cape region. Political analysts said the lead was due to support from coloureds, who fared better under apartheid than blacks but not as well as whites. Mr Hernus Kriel, the white law and order minister, told reporters he expected an outright win in the race for premier of the region, which has Cape Town as its capital. Mr Allan Boesak, coloured ANC premiership candidate, conceded that defeat was imminent: 'The ANC will accept the outcome of the democratic process. As a people and as an ANC organisation in the Western Cape, we are ready to do whatever the situation demands of us.' Earlier, radical ANC activist Tony Yengeni, a member of the party's regional executive, broke ranks to talk of his sense of betrayal at the apparent NP lead. 'Already the man in the street in the (black) township is feeling betrayed,' he said. 'We have been tortured and oppressed by the white man in this country for so long. . . and now a section of the population votes for the party that oppressed us to return to power.' The region's coloured community descends from early unions the Dutch settlers and the later British arrivals had with the indigenous black population they found at the Cape. Mr Yengeni said ANC leaders would have to act decisively to prevent a black backlash against the mainly Afrikaans-speaking coloureds, who comprise almost 60 per cent of the 2.3m Western Cape electorate. Emotional ANC and NP supporters gathered and traded insults late on Sunday on Cape Town's Grand Parade, where Mr Mandela made his first public appearance after his release from 27 years in jail in February 1990. Ms Miriam Ebrahim wept as she watched NP members celebrating their likely victory with shouts of 'Viva FW de Klerk.' She said: 'It was our own people that stabbed us in the back.' But Mr Andre Hofmeister, a coloured whose name underlines his half-European ancestry, pointed to a crowd of ANC supporters dancing with posters of Mandela and said: 'These people are too stupid to realise that, if a black man rules this country, it will be run into the ground.' In a squalid shantytown there was no echo of the animosity evident on the Grand Parade. Standing next to a wooden fruit and vegetable stand, an ANC supporter, Mr Emanuel Makunga, said that most blacks would accept the results peacefully as part of the democratic process. 'This was a liberation election,' he said. 'People are more happy that they could vote for the first time than they will be upset that the ANC didn't win here. People respect the election process. But they won't be happy to be ruled by the same NP again.'   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.   Industries:-  P9199 General Government, NEC.     P8651 Political Organizations.

0,FT944-1778 ,"FT944-1778 _AN-ELSDLAAVFT 941219   FT  19 DEC 94 / Leadership of ANC admits party disarray      By MARK SUZMAN      BLOEMFONTEIN   The top leadership of the African National Con-gress has ack-nowledged that the party is in organisational disarray and was unprepared for the demands of becoming the dominant partner in South Africa's government of national unity. In his official report to the ANC's triennial conference in Bloemfontein yesterday Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, ANC secretary general, said the party had not sufficiently prepared itself for dealing with the bureaucratic tasks of government. As a result, the slow flow of new legislation, combined with ineffective policy implementation by a recalcitrant bureaucracy, had delayed delivery on the party's election promises. In a well-received address to 3,000 ANC delegates from around the country, Mr Ramaphosa also admitted that the party's paid-up membership had dropped off sharply following the April election, and that unmet debts incurred during the election campaign had led to the use of fewer full-time party officers. However, he said he expected the conference to agree on a new membership structure to help combat this as well as cutting the excessive workload for top party officials. The admissions are an acknowledgement by the ANC of some grassroots dissatisfaction with the slow pace of change since it came to power following the country's April elections. Still, the conference seems likely to accept a proposed strategy document presented yesterday by deputy President Thabo Mbeki, which puts forward a generally moderate political line and calls for a national consensus on economic policy centred around opening the South African market to increased trade and capital flows to boost local investment and productivity. However the wide-ranging document notes that, while the ANC needs to improve its standing among whites, its primary focus should be the needs of the country's black community. It also says that the bureaucracy, army and police force should be rapidly transformed to make them more representative in terms of both race and gender and more accountable to government. Both Mr Ramaphosa and Mr Mbeki's speeches followed the line set in President Nelson Mandela's opening address to the five-day conference on Saturday, when he admitted that the pace of change had been slow, but insisted there were no short-term solutions to the entrenched problems South Africa faces. 'Ours is not a programme of quick handouts but one for serious and lasting transformation,' he said. Mr Mandela also went out of his way to defend the ANC's commitment to fiscal discipline and economic reform against radicals calling for faster change. He insisted that such policies were 'neither luxuries nor requirements foreign to the ANC's own policies', stressing that they represented the best way of achieving sustainable growth. In this light, Mr Mandela said that given the difficulties of governance and delivery, the ANC should make more of an effort to explain to people the reasons behind unpopular decisions. 'This is the best antidote to attempts by opportunists of all hues to gain popularity on the basis of radical-sounding but impractical propositions,' he said. The president reiterated that one of the main obstacles facing the government's economic programme was the preponderance of economic power in white hands. This, he said, led to 'attempts to discourage new entrants and foreign investors because the cartels overcharging society fear competition'.   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.

0,FT943-8240 ,"FT943-8240 _AN-EHRD3AC9FT 940818   FT  18 AUG 94 / A town like Kokstad      By PATTI WALDMEIR   Nelson Mandela made racial reconciliation the top priority of his first 100 days in office. And in the streets of the Natal town of Kokstad - preposterously wide and scrupulously clean, like the streets of almost every other white dorp (town) in South Africa - his crusade has made its mark. In the hospital and the library, the hotels and the shops, change is subtly apparent. Eager or suspicious, reluctant or resigned, the people of Kokstad are struggling to assume the new identity thrust on them by the constitution: as equal citizens of one non-racial nation. In the elegant Cape Dutch town hall building which serves as library, librarian Heather Blackway can no longer pretend to herself - as so many whites have done for so many decades - that she does not live in Africa. White hegemony established Kokstad (which, ironically, was founded by native Griqua tribesmen in the late 19th century) as a small corner of Europe in Africa. 'Now we are an African dorp, no doubt about it,' Mrs Blackway comments wistfully, noting that she can never be sure of finding garlic in the local greengrocer's - because, she says, blacks eat cabbage and most consumers are now black - and lamenting the fact that 'African time is part of our everyday existence now'. The library has been transformed: April's elections triggered a flood of new black members, who now outnumber the whites. For though the library has been open to all races for some time, Africans were reluctant to demand their municipal rights until a black government was in place. Mrs Blackway welcomes this, but cannot help complaining of the cultural changes it has wrought. 'They all talk so loud,' she says, while another librarian comments that whites no longer linger for a (quiet) chat at the check-out desk, as in the old South Africa. Mrs Blackway is clearly suffering a crisis of identity in her native land. Like most white Kokstad residents, she finds it hard to relate to its new symbols: the multicoloured flag, which one white town councillor dismisses as 'a jockstrap up a flagpole'; the new national anthem, Nkosi sikele i'Africa (God Bless Africa), which has joined the Afrikaans anthem Die Stem; even the new president. For while Mr Mandela is universally popular among both blacks and whites, Mrs Blackway and most others say he is not 'our president' - he is president of one section of a still-divided nation, not yet the national leader. But if some of Kokstad's whites are none too keen on the new South Africa - local blacks say they are regularly confronted by the taunt 'Go and ask Mandela' when looking for a job - others focus on the fact that, whatever the current uncertainties, things could have been so much worse. Athena Fawcett and her husband Paul farm dairy and beef cattle near the border with the former black homeland of Transkei, where several white motorists and farmers were murdered before the elections. Athena points to the spot just outside her home where an armoured car used to mount a daily roadblock; now life is peaceful again, neighbours travel to Transkei resorts for holidays, and Athena says she is 'totally relaxed'. She thinks President Mandela is a 'saint on earth', and her husband concurs. Mayor Bevan Gattrell also agrees. 'The election came and within days you would have sworn you were in a different country. All of a sudden we were all part of the same country.' The poll lifted a weight from his shoulders. 'Now we can also say: this bloody government,' says Mr Gattrell, noting that the town was one of the first to set up an ad hoc multiracial local council to run Kokstad (population 5,000 whites and 5,000 coloureds) and the black township of Bhongweni (population 18,000 blacks) until local elections next year. Residents of Bhongweni, like their white counterparts, reflect a variety of views. Elderly nurse Elsina Masizana says race relations were transformed by the election. 'Whites used to nurse the whites and blacks used to nurse the blacks. Now we are working hand in hand together.' Fellow nurse Rosemary Mapekula is less sanguine. 'Sometimes I come across whites and they are nice. Other times I think these people are not yet in the mood,' she says. Young Simon Zondi, local political activist and chairman of the Bhongweni Civic Association, is more forthright. 'Whites are saying that (blacks can take over) at national level 'but not in my house, not where I work, I am still a white man and he is a black man'.' But even Mr Zondi, who is impatient for change not just in race relations but in economic development, acknowledges 'it's not an easy thing. You don't just wake up and things have changed. 'If it happens in three months, it won't be real,' he concludes. The honeymoon is over; now the real work of nation-building can begin.   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.

0,FT924-6421 ,"FT924-6421 _AN-CKWCEAATFT 921121   FT  21 NOV 92 / Japan's leaders to testify on scandal: Ruling party backs down after opposition blocks economic package in parliament      By CHARLES LEADBEATER      TOKYO   JAPAN'S parliament yesterday cleared the way for debate on the long delayed Y2,990bn (Pounds 16bn) supplementary budget to boost the economy after the ruling Liberal Democratic Party agreed to produce three key figures at the heart of the Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin scandal for questioning. The budget, which is central to the implementation of the Y10,700bn emergency public spending package announced in August, has been held up for more than two weeks by the dispute over testimony about the scandal. The LDP, under heavy economic and political pressure, agreed to opposition demands that Mr Hiroyasu Watanabe, the former president of Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin should give evidence under oath. Mr Watanabe's testimony could provide the long running scandal with a new lease of life by linking up to 12 LDP leaders to his former company, which made illegal donations to politicians. In court this month Mr Watanabe alleged that he gave money to several LDP leaders. It is also alleged that Mr Watanabe acted as an intermediary between LDP politicians, right wing nationalists and organised crime syndicates. Mr Watanabe is in prison during his trial on breach of trust charges brought by his former employer, a leading trucking and courier company. It is not clear when or where he will be questioned. The LDP also agreed that Mr Noboru Takeshita, the powerful former prime minister and Mr Shin Kanemaru, the former leader of the LDP's largest faction should give sworn testimony. Mr Takeshita is likely to testify next Thursday, while Mr Kanemaru is likely to be questioned at his hospital bedside after undergoing eye surgery next week. Mr Kanemaru recently resigned from parliament after admitting that he had received an illegal political donation of Y500m from Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin in 1990. Mr Takeshita faces allegations that he enlisted the company's help to ask organised crime syndicates to quell a right wing smear campaign against him when he was seeking to become prime minister in the late 1980s. The parliament's budget committee began work on the supplementary budget immediately by questioning Mr Tsutomu Hata, the finance minister. The committee will question the cabinet on the budget next week. Although the agreement is a reflection of the public pressure on the LDP over the affair, it also marks an important step in its attempt to regain the political initiative after more than two weeks of drift and stalemate. In the past few days the party has come under increasing pressure from business leaders to break the parliamentary impasse which has held up the budget. Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister has attempted to respond to business criticism and assert his authority over the fractious squabbling at the top of the party by calling on the finance ministry to draw up plans for an expansionary budget for 1993. The LDP also signalled yesterday that it may be prepared to amend its limited proposals for political reform by taking on board some of the opposition's demands.

Answer: Vietnam welcomes the results of the South African  election; the victory of the ANC and the election of Chairman  Nelson Mandela as South Africa's president. This victory is the  result of a long and hard struggle by the South African people  against apartheid.

Answer: There are two different issues here that are  sometimes confused. I would like to clarify the following:    1. Vietnam has had enough historical and juridical documents  to reaffirm its undisputable sovereignty over the Truong Sa  Archipelago. Therefore, foreign activities involving  exploration, surveying, and exploitation of resources in the  Truong Sa Archipelago without Vietnam's permission are in  violation of Vietnamese sovereignty.    With respect to measures to settle the dispute there,  Vietnam  has made it clear that these should be on the basis of equality,  understanding, mutual respect, respect for international law and  the 1982 Convention on Maritime Law, and respect for the  national sovereignty of countries that have special economic  zones and continental shelves. All sides must refrain from  further complicating the situation, using violence, or  threatening to use violence. Vietnam has consistently followed  this line.    2. The Tu Chinh area lies fully within Vietnam's economic  zone and continental shelf. Vietnam determinedly reaffirms its  sovereignty over this area in conformity with the regulations of  current international maritime law. There is no disputed area  here; this issue was intentionally created by somebody and  incorrectly accepted by somebody else.    Even before 1975, this area was divided into lots for  bidding  by foreign companies to conduct surveys and exploit oil and gas,  including the Mobil Company of the United States. After 1975,  the Vietnam Oil and Gas Company divided it into lots, conducted  surveys, and explored for oil and gas. This included setting up  joint ventures with foreign countries. Nobody said anything  about it. In fact, nobody could say anything about it because  Vietnam acted in accordance with international law.    Vietnam and other regional countries are concerned about  recent reports regarding the activities of some countries, which  complicate the situation in the Truong Sa Archipelago as well on  Vietnam's continental shelf.

0,FT942-13374 ,"FT942-13374 _AN-EDZEDAACFT 940426   FT  26 APR 94 / Rightwing extremist attacks on S Africa poll feared      By MICHAEL HOLMAN and MARK SUZMAN      JOHANNESBURG   Rightwing extremists were feared last night to be planning violent attacks targeting polling stations in South Africa's first all-race elections, which start today, after bombers struck again yesterday. Last night a bomb exploded in a black area of Pretoria following a car bombing earlier in the day in Germiston, near Johannesburg, that killed 10 people and injured 36. Police said a number of people could have been killed in the Pretoria bombing, but no casaulty figures were available. Yesterday's attacks brought the number of explosions since Saturday to 13. The Germiston bomb was planted at a rank for minibus taxis used by blacks. Nine people were killed and nearly 100 injured in Sunday's car bomb explosion in central Johannesburg. Security in and around polling stations was being tightened last night after talks between President FW de Klerk and Mr Nelson Mandela, the African National Congress leader. Although no one has so far claimed responsibility, it seemed likely the country's extreme white right has mounted a campaign to disrupt the three-day poll. Today the elderly and infirm go to the polls, as well as South Africans abroad. The rest of the 22m eligible voters are able to cast their ballots tomorrow and on Thursday. The attacks, which have shattered the optimism that greeted the decision a week ago of Zulu Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi to take part in the poll, are expected to target the 9,000 polling stations around the country. Shortly before yesterday's attack in Germiston, Mr de Klerk stressed that the election would go ahead. 'We are not going to allow the right wing or anyone else to delay this election,' he said. At the same time, the shift of conservative opinion to the Freedom Front led by retired army general Constand Viljoen, which is taking part in the election, continued yesterday as MPs and town councillors defected from the Conservative party, which is boycotting the poll. The impact of the blasts is hard to determine. Recent research into voter attitude suggested that blacks were more inured to violence than whites, and thus more likely to ignore the risk and cast their vote. Visiting some of the victims of Sunday's blast, Mr Mandela said: 'I am convinced tough measures if applied can bring these people to book. I hope the government acts in a way to remove the impression it is a government of weaklings.' Mr de Klerk and Mr Mandela are understood to be close to agreeing an amnesty for perpetrators of past acts of violence, in an attempt to defuse the rightwing threat and reassure white members of the security forces fearful of retribution under an ANC-led government. Bombs have also gone off at the Steynsburg town hall in the eastern Cape, at Bloemhof magistrates' court in western Transvaal, and at a taxi rank in Randfontein, west of Johannesburg. Most of the attacks have been close to polling stations. South African police have offered a R1m (Pounds 185,000) reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible. The stock market shrugged off news of the bombings, with the general index finishing up 28 points at 5,068.

The paper, quoting what it said were highly reliable  sources,  said the warheads were loaded on a special train that was to  arrive Wednesday in a city in the Caucasus where the weapons  will be transferred to the factory where they were assembled.    A spokesman for the ministry of defense here denied the  report saying ""that no nuclear warheads have left the Ukraine  for the moment.""

""But, that said, employers and workers alike must agree we have  had more than our share of holidays. Much as the time off was  appreciated, the days off were totally disruptive of work  schedules."" Taking the discussion one step further, the  editorial then asks if it is not ""time now to look afresh at the  number of public holidays and assess whether all are necessary,""  because the overabundance of holidays plays ""havoc with  productivity.""    ANC Reaction to Mandela Retirement -- A second editorial on  the same page of the 17 May THE STAR states that ""the ANC is the  government of a democracy now -- a democracy which needs to be  nurtured.

It  is sometimes plain stupid,"" the editorial states in reaction to  the London SUNDAY TIMES article, which alleged that Mandela  would retire after two years. Mandela's ""response, instead of  being a simple 'not true', was over-heavy: 'malicious  disinformation .... rumour- mongering with the intention to  create uncertainty.'""

As ""banks are unlikely to be eager lenders to people on low  incomes,"" ""an early policy statement on the role and  establishment of a state-owned mortgage bank"" is needed. ""In  theory labour-intensive construction is needed to create jobs,  to stimulate the economy and to provide employees with the wages  needed to buy homes.

Violent Crime -- As ""two major factors -- political  instability and violence -- spurred most of the capital flight  and emigration,"" ""the first problem should diminish as the  government foes work together.""

Nixon library constitutes the  former President's most recent effort in a 16-year campaign to reshape the  public's view of Watergate.    Library officials repeatedly had told reporters in recent days and weeks that  the tapes presented at the museum would be left unedited. Asked Friday about  that, library director Hugh Hewitt declined to comment. ""That's a museum-design  question,"" he said, adding that the building's design had been supervised by  Nixon's top aide and spokesman, John Taylor.    Taylor could not be reached for comment.    The Watergate display, which Nixon avoided when he gave President Bush and  former Presidents Reagan and Ford a tour of the rest of his museum Thursday,  opened to the public Friday. It consists of three White House tapes, two of  which will not be available to visitors until September, and a long wall of  text and photographs describing the events of the Watergate scandal.    The one tape available to the public now is the so-called ""smoking gun"" tape of  July 23, 1972, in which Nixon approved a plan to have the CIA warn the FBI to  stop its investigation of Watergate. The library version of the tape presents  only some portions of the conversation, stitched together with a narration that  offers innocent explanations for what Nixon is heard saying. The tape concludes  with Nixon reading a diary entry made two weeks later describing later events.    The text displays concede that ""Nixon himself has said he made inexcusable  misjudgments during Watergate"" but accuse many of Nixon's critics -- ranging  from the late Sen. Sam Ervin (D-N.C.), who chaired the Senate's investigation  of Watergate, to Archibald Cox, the Harvard law professor who served as special  prosecutor until Nixon fired him -- of ""partisan"" bias.    Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward and his former colleague Carl Bernstein  are singled out for special criticism. One display accuses the two, who won a  Pulitzer Prize for their reporting on Watergate, of ""offering bribes, illegally  gaining access to telephone numbers and talking to members of the grand jury""  in their efforts.    The display puts that accusation in quotes attributed only to an unnamed  ""scholar."" The quotation is from a recent book on Watergate by Stanley I.  Kutler of the University of Wisconsin. Kutler, in an interview Friday, said  that in the book he did not make the charge himself, but merely had noted that  others had said it. Woodward, in an interview Friday, denied ever having  offered bribes.    Kutler said: ""Nixon is blaming the media and everyone else for his troubles  while Watergate was his own doing and that of his aides. The media simply  reported the investigations of properly constituted legal authorities.""    As portrayed in thousands of pages of transcripts from court trials and  congressional hearings, hundreds of hours of taped White House conversations  and depositions from scores of witnesses, the scandal which became known as  ""Watergate"" was, in fact, two overlapping conspiracies.    The first, begun early in the Nixon term, was a plan to use wiretaps,  burglaries and surveillance by the FBI, the CIA and independent groups  organized by White House aides to harass, spy on and punish the President's  enemies. Members of one of those independent groups, known informally as ""the  plumbers,"" were arrested on June 17, 1972, as they tried to break into the  offices of the Democratic national chairman Lawrence O'Brien in Washington's  Watergate office building.    Before the scandal ended, John D. Ehrlichman, Nixon's top domestic policy  adviser, G. Gordon Liddy, the general counsel to Nixon's reelection campaign  and eight others were found guilty of criminal acts connected to that  conspiracy. The museum contains no mention of that first conspiracy or the  convictions that flowed from it.    The second conspiracy, which began almost immediately after the Watergate  arrests, was designed to cover up the first conspiracy.    Ehrlichman, H.R. Haldeman, who was Nixon's chief of staff, Atty. Gen. John N.  Mitchell and eight others were found guilty of criminal acts in connection with  that conspiracy. Nixon's own participation in the cover-up effort led the  Watergate grand jury to name him a ""unindicted co-conspirator"" on Feb. 29,  1974, and formed the basis for most of the impeachment charges that the House  Judiciary Committee approved, 27-11, on July 27, 1974.    Related charges involving illegal campaign contributions, tax law violations  and political ""dirty tricks"" led to guilty pleas or convictions for 50 other  individuals and corporations.    As portrayed by the museum's display, the scandal that drove Nixon from office  is far different, the way the former President has always seen it: ""an epic and  bloody political battle"" in which Democrats sought to reverse the ""mandate of  the 1972 election"" by forcing him from office.    Visitors to the museum first hear of Watergate during a 27-minute film that  portrays highlights of Nixon's career. The mention is brief. ""The President  knew nothing about it,"" a narrator says, referring to the Watergate break-in.  But, the narrator continues, in the months that followed, ""some of his aides""  became involved in a ""cover-up."" The film then leaves the subject entirely,  returning only to say, without further explanation, that ""threatened with  impeachment,"" Nixon resigned.    The Watergate room itself presents a carefully selected set of facts about the  scandal. Nixon, the opening display says, ""did not pay much attention to"" the  break-in when he first heard of it the next day. That display does not mention  the fact that Nixon and Haldeman met and discussed the break-in for 20 minutes  two days later.    The tape of that July 20 discussion was mysteriously erased -- the notorious 18  1/2-minute gap that became one of Watergate's most notorious incidents.  According to the museum display, which mentions the gap but does not explain  which conversation it involved, ""experts said the gap could easily have been  caused by a mechanical malfunction, but the President's opponents wasted no  time in finding sinister and devious motives.""    In fact, a team of experts appointed by federal District Judge John J. Sirica  reported on June 4 that the tape had been erased by hand and that  ""malfunctioning of the recorder"" is ""conclusively eliminated"" as a possible  cause of the erasures.

0,FT922-2369 ,"FT922-2369 _AN-CFQA6AD8FT 920617   FT  17 JUN 92 / Weinberger indicted on Iran-Contra charges      By JUREK MARTIN and ALAN FRIEDMAN      WASHINGTON, NEW YORK   MR CASPAR WEINBERGER, US secretary of defence during the Reagan administration, was last night indicted by a federal grand jury on criminal charges stemming from the Iran-Contra scandal. He becomes the highest-level US official and the first former cabinet member to be charged in relation to the scandal, which centred on the clandestine sale of weapons to Iran and the diversion of millions of dollars in profits to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels. The diversions, in 1985 and 1986, occurred in spite of a congressional ban on US military aid to the Contras. In a brief television appearance last night, Mr Weinberger declined to take questions but described the indictment as 'a grotesque distortion of prosecutorial powers and a moral and legal outrage'. He said it was a matter of record that he fought the Iran-Contra policies 'at every turn' inside the administration. He implied the special prosecutor had offered him a plea bargain - a lesser charge in return for assistance in naming other government officials - which he had rejected. He insisted he had co-operated fully with the special prosecutor's investigations, including handing over private papers. The 31-page charge sheet identifies five alleged offences; two of perjury, two of making false statements and one of obstruction. Among them, Mr Weinberger is accused of lying to Congress about his knowledge of the arms sales and of Saudi Arabian contributions to the Contras. The indictment of Mr Weinberger - defence secretary between 1981 and 1987 and now the publisher of Forbes magazine in New York - follows an intensive effort by prosecutors to investigate allegations that top aides to President Ronald Reagan engaged in a cover-up and withheld information from Congress. Yesterday Mr Craig Gillen, the deputy independent prosecutor, denied that Mr Reagan himself was a target of the investigations. 'I don't want to leave any inference about other people,' he said in a reference apparently intended to include Mr Reagan and Mr George Shultz, the former secretary of state who has also been questioned. It remains uncertain whether the indictment could have an impact on President George Bush or lead to attempts by Mr Bush's opponents in the presidential election campaign to revive the scandal as an issue. In recent months the Iran-Contra prosecutors have also questioned General Colin Powell, now chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and a former aide to Mr Weinberger. Mr Powell is believed to have defended his former boss and to have described him as someone frustrated in his efforts to stop the sale of arms to Iran. The indictment focuses on Mr Weinberger's statements in June 1987 to the House committee investigating the Iran-Contra affair and on his personal diaries, recently obtained from the Library of Congress, which apparently contain several references to arms shipments to Iran in 1985. He told the committee he did not know about the shipment of US Hawk anti-aircraft missiles from Israel to Iran in November 1985 - and only learned about the shipment when the scandal became public a year later.

In a speech for delivery at Westminster to MPs and peers, he said the classification as a middle-income country was a 'false perception', ignoring the fact that 'the majority of our population, which happens to be black, lives in conditions of dire poverty'. Mr Mandela, who will be in Geneva today, said eligibility for aid from such bodies as the UN Development Programme was being put at risk because 'so rich are the few that are rich that it becomes impossible to see that the poor exist at all'.

Bankers involved in the issue claimed that Dollars 400m had so far been subscribed. The disclosure caused surprise because last week - with the share price under pressure in Bombay in the wake of the nation's worst financial scandal  -the group had said that it was planning to launch its issue towards the end of June. The authorised issue is in a range equivalent to Rs250-280 (Pounds 4.90-Pounds 5.50) a share - based on an anticipated price-earnings ratio in March 1993.

0,FT933-12579 ,"FT933-12579 _AN-DGWCHADTFT 930723   FT  23 JUL 93 / Survey of European Building and Construction (5): After the dust clears, recovery can start - Italy: The award of public contracts has been paralysed by a political scandal      By PETER COOPER   THIS IS an exceptionally difficult year for the Pounds 80bn Italian construction market. A sharp downturn in the business cycle has coincided with a major scandal over public sector contract awards. The market forecaster Cresme predicts a 5 per cent fall in total construction output in 1993. But even that could prove optimistic. There was a 17 per cent fall in cement consumption in the first quarter of the year which points to a much bigger decline in construction output. At the moment the award of public sector contracts is virtually paralysed by the Mani Pulite (clean hands) inquiry. Ten of the top 15 Italian contractors are under investigation for the alleged illegal funding of political parties. The biggest name in the industry, Pounds 750m-a-year Cogefar-Impresit, heads the list; other companies include Pounds 230m-a-year Grassetto and Pounds 360m-a-year Lodigiani. More and more contractors, politicians and government officials have been implicated in the scandal surrounding the alleged payment of party political contributions to secure public sector contracts. So far this year, the number of such contract awards has slumped by more than two-thirds. The Pounds 16bn-a-year public sector construction market is in disarray. Large civil engineering contracts are the hardest hit by the crisis. But the Pounds 2bn-a-year public sector building sub-sector is largely unscathed. A five-year modernisation of barracks for the Carbinieri and a prison rebuilding programme are unaffected. The crisis is also damaging private sector work. Planning permission is at present almost impossible to obtain in the big Italian cities because everyone is afraid to take a decision that might attract the magistrates' eagle eye. 'The wave of scandals has not only blocked public sector contracts worth Pounds 12bn a year, but has also shut down Pounds 42bn worth of private sector projects,' says Mr Riccardo Pisa, president of the National Building Association. 'There is no longer anyone who has the courage to approve any type of scheme.' Market commentators think things will get worse before they get better. 'The government will have to cancel projects like the high speed train to reduce its budget deficit,' says Professor Aldo Norso of Milan University. 'Public spending on construction will fall.' Recovery hopes are pinned on the private sector which, contractors believe, will become more involved in infrastructure development. There are reasons for optimism. Italian motorways are tolled, and their development could be financed privately. Italians are also the biggest savers in Europe, and might be persuaded to invest directly in infrastructure schemes. Of more immediate interest to contractors are the proposed giant commercial building projects, such as the plan to build a Canary Wharf-style financial district near the Garibaldi station in Milan. These developments are stalled by the political crisis. Nonetheless, property agents report a shortage of high quality office space in Italy as well as inadequate hotel accommodation and retail space. A commercial building boom is in prospect in the near future. Mr Paul Bacon, of Milan-based commercial property agent Healey  Bacon, says there is a shortage of quality office accommodation in Milan, with less than two years' supply. He points to many opportunities for retail chains. 'Out-of-town shopping is very underdeveloped in Italy and many of the big international names are absent from the high streets,' he says. However, commentators do not see the commercial building market improving greatly until a new government is elected in the autumn and confidence is restored in the Italian economy. Mr George Soros, the well-known Wall Street investor, currently rates Italy as having the best investment potential of any country in Europe. Italian contractors hope others will heed his advice, and look for investment opportunities at the bottom of a very deep business cycle. WT Partnership, the British quantity surveyor, has established a 12-strong office in Milan in anticipation of a private sector boom. It hopes to advise developers on new projects. 'We see the current political crisis clearing in the next 12 months,' says Mr Roy Merritt, a WT partner. 'Electoral reform should provide the catalyst for economic stability. The situation is already improving in Milan with the election of a new mayor and council. Italy is going through a quiet revolution, and those looking to take part in the recovery should be making a move now, not next year.' This year the private sector has benefited from a fall in long-term interest rates from 15 to 11 per cent. The devaluation of the lire last September has also helped to keep the private sector competitive internationally. All the same, Cresme still sees a 6 per cent decline in commercial and industrial construction output in 1993, before a 1 per cent upturn next year. Consumer confidence has taken a tumble during the political upheaval. Forecasters say the impact of the crisis on both private purchaser confidence and public housebuilding activity will depress housing starts from 278,000 last year to 265,000, despite a sharp fall in mortgage rates from their 18 per cent peak last December. But most market analysts think a new government will succeed in cleaning up the system. It would have a revolt on the streets if it failed to do so. Feelings are running very high among contractors and materials producers who are seeing their businesses ruined. So it is more than likely that the Italian construction industry will somersault from seemingly intractable public paralysis to private prosperity. The industry is at a major turning point. It is shifting its focus from the public sector to private-led development with international participation. Yet this is a horribly painful process for those trying to earn a living this year: 1993 will be a difficult period for Italian contractors and material producers. Even the infamous Italian 'Black Economy' is in for a rough ride, with Cresme forecasting a 4 per cent fall in activity to Pounds 11bn this year.   Countries:-  ITZ  Italy, EC.

SAVAGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER      WASHINGTON      The government's effort to recover money lost in the savings and loan scandal  suffered a setback Tuesday as the Supreme Court ruled that convicted criminals  may avoid paying restitution to their victims by filing for bankruptcy.    The 7-2 ruling also is a blow to the ""victim's rights"" movement. In recent  years, courts have been given new authority to order criminals to pay crime  victims for their losses and injuries. In many instances of fraud or other  financial crimes, judges have ordered criminals to pay fines and repay the  stolen money rather than go to prison.    Last year, Congress gave the Justice Department an extra $75 million to pursue  fraud investigations in the savings and loan scandal and told prosecutors to  seek court orders demanding that former thrift officials repay at least part of  the money they fraudulently squandered.    Now, such court orders are in jeopardy.    With some evident reluctance, the high court concluded Tuesday that the federal  bankruptcy law gives any ""debtor,"" including a convicted criminal, the right to  ""a discharge of all debts."" Since Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code includes no  exceptions, the court said it could not create one for criminal restitution  orders.    Only Justices Harry A. Blackmun and Sandra Day O'Connor dissented, contending  that Congress did not mean to cover criminal restitution orders when it wrote  the bankruptcy laws.    ""This means that criminals everywhere can get rid of restitution orders or  criminal fines by declaring bankruptcy,"" said Richard A. Samp of the Washington  Legal Foundation, which filed a court brief on behalf of several victim's  rights groups.    The case (Pennsylvania vs. Davenport, 89-156) was brought by Pennsylvania  officials seeking to recover $4,145 from a couple who pleaded guilty to welfare  fraud, but filed for bankruptcy before paying back the money.    As a result of Tuesday's ruling, judges may be forced to send more white collar  criminals to prison because they cannot be sure that a restitution order will  be honored, Samp said. He also urged Congress to rewrite the bankruptcy code to  reverse the ruling.    Last year, the Justice Department told the court that 7,350 investigations were  under way involving possible criminal fraud in the banking and S&L  industries. ""In many instances, the defendants are white-collar defendants who,  though insolvent at the conclusion of their criminal proceedings, have  prospects for substantial future income,"" it said in a brief to the court.    Therefore, judges should be permitted to order such criminals to repay their  debts to the taxpayers over many years.    Under Tuesday's ruling, a former thrift official who is convicted of fraud may  be sent to prison. But if he is then bankrupt, he may not be forced to repay  the government in the future for the losses he caused.    The federal bailout of the S&L industry is expected to cost taxpayers as  much as $325 billion.    In other actions, the court:     -- Ruled that a person once convicted of drunken driving may not be prosecuted  later for a homicide that resulted from the same car accident. The ""double  jeopardy"" clause of the Fifth Amendment says that a person may not ""be twice  put in jeopardy of life or limb . . . for the same offense.""    In this case (Grady vs. Corbin, 89-474), local prosecutors in Upstate New York  allowed Thomas Corbin to plead guilty to drunken driving and driving on the  wrong side of the road. But other prosecutors in the same office decided later  to charge him with homicide in the death of a motorist. But on a 5-4 vote, the  court said this amounted to a second prosecution for the same offense and was  therefore unconstitutional.     -- Let stand an $800,000 judgment against two Ku Klux Klan groups for a  violent attack on civil rights marchers in Forsythe County, Ga., in 1987  (Stephens vs. McKinney, 89-1558).

A general lack of buying interest as dealers continued to reflect on the UK political scene characterised the morning session. Having opened at 2,854, the June contract on the FTSE dipped to 2,852 and hovered around that level for the next few hours. The release of the US figures over the lunch hour prised buyers from the sidelines sending the June contract to the day's high of 2,873.

The sources said the arrest of former Construction  Minister Kishiro Nakamura earlier in the day will further hurt  Kajima Corp., which allegedly bribed him, as well as other major  contractors.    The tarnished image of these dominant players in the sector,  involved in this and other scandals, has already driven many  customers away. Worse still, the revelation of the malpractices  comes at a time when construction orders had already sunk to a  nadir.    Some industry officials, however, saw at least one benefit  of  the scandal. An executive at a second-tier contractor said,  ""because of this scandal, politicians will refrain from  demanding bribes from us in the future.""    ""So far, we could not but give them bribes because they  would  cause us troubles unless we did so,"" he said.     "

The Nikkei 225 average closed 36.41 up at the day's high of 20,628.53 on index-linked buying and purchases by some domestic institutions. The index fell to a low of 20,533.51 in the morning, but it was supported in the afternoon by small-lot buying on reports of the optical fibre development, and of a consortium of 45 companies planning to commercialise it. Volume totalled 264m shares, against 181.2m. Some investors bought telecom stocks ahead of Japan Telecom's listing next Tuesday. The Topix index of all first section shares edged ahead 3.02 to 1,640.39 and the Nikkei 300 gained 1.09 at 299.25, but declines led rises by 519 to 389, with 224 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 0.80 to 1,338.66. Mitsubishi Rayon, the day's most active issue, advanced Y47, or 11 per cent, to Y472. As the leading plastic fibre manufacturer, it will be participating in the consortium. Brokers and investors piled into the stock, which did not trade during the morning due to a lack of sellers. Other beneficiaries included NEC, ahead Y20 at Y1,220, Fujitsu, up Y10 at Y1,090, and Sumitomo Electric Industries, a leading telecom cable company, which firmed Y10 to Y1,500. Other telecommunication stocks were actively traded. Nitsuko climbed Y40 to Y1,620 and NTT moved ahead Y13,000 to Y912,000. In Osaka, the OSE average receded 20.56 to 22,852.05 in volume of 43.5m shares. Roundup The bullish trend in New York was echoed and, in some cases, amplified. Kuala Lumpur was closed for Malaysia's National Day holiday. HONG KONG's Hang Seng index finished above 9,900 for the first time since mid-March, rising 242.83, or 2.5 per cent, to 9,929.39. Turnover climbed again, from HKDollars 5.19bn to HKDollars 6.50bn. Brokers said the visit to Beijing by US commerce secretary Mr Ron Brown rekindled American investors' interest in Hong Kong as well as in China. Jardine Matheson surged HKDollars 4.75 to HKDollars 72.75 and Jardine Strategic advanced HKDollars 2.90 to HKDollars 32. They had lagged behind the recent market rise, and news that share trading of the companies will shift to Singapore from January 3 after delisting from Hong Kong boosted interest. BOMBAY hit an all-time high, the BSE 30-share index adding 62.91 at 4,588.16 on good company results and a normal monsoon. Brokers said this bull market had more virtues than its predecessor which peaked over two years ago; the latter, they added, was fuelled by money which came from the inter-bank securities market and led to the country's worst ever, Dollars 1.28bn financial scandal. The scandal involved brokers and bankers who colluded to divert money from the securities market to the then booming Bombay bourse. Share prices crashed after the scandal was exposed in April 1992. BANGKOK posted its fourth consecutive gain on foreign buying of banking and communications blue chips, and on active speculative trade. The SET index closed 32.30, or 2.2 per cent, higher at 1,524.83. Turnover increased from Bt14.2bn to Bt18.6bn. Banks rose 3.3 per cent in Bt5bn of turnover, and communications by 4.3 per cent in Bt2.7bn. SYDNEY's golds gained 1.4 per cent as the All Ordinaries index put on 5.6 at 2,122.1. The Perth-based Orbital Engine jumped 19 cents, or nearly 11 per cent, to ADollars 1.94 on its development of a cheap fuel injection system for motorcycle engines, claimed to cut pollution by 95 per cent and boost fuel efficiency by 45 per cent. WELLINGTON was lifted by well received results from Fletcher Challenge, which appreciated 13 cents to NZDollars 4.18, a 1994 high for the industrial conglomerate. The NZSE-40 index moved up 15.67 to 2,148.48. KARACHI remained under pressure due to political uncertainty, the KSE 100 index falling 34.56 to 2,186.90.   Countries:-  JPZ  Japan, Asia.

Rogers, who won the 1980 Heisman Trophy while at South Carolina and now works  as a fund raiser for the school, had traces of cocaine in his right nostril  when he was arrested Saturday at a Columbia apartment, Richland County Sheriff  Allan Sloan said.

Takeshi Nagano, chairman of the Japan Federation of  Employers' Associations (Nikkeiren), told a news conference  Hosokawa should take tough action to get the bill through the  Diet. His remark indicated he considers it unavoidable for the  ruling coalition government to vote on the bill, even in the  absence of opposition parties, observers said.    Parliamentary debate on the budget has been stalled over  demands by the opposition Liberal Democratic Party that Hosokawa  disclose details of a 100 million yen loan he accepted from the  scandal-tainted trucking firm Sagawa Kyubin Co. and purchases  of shares in Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. made by the  premier in the name of his late father-in-law.    Nagano said the budget committee should resume debate on the  budget quickly and transfer discussions on the scandal to other  panels.     "

Both are  recipients of last year's Nobel Peace Prize and the American  Liberty Award. Both are certain to be part of a new government  of national unity. Their position in that government will be  determined in South Africa's first nonracial election, now only  12 days away. Twenty-six parties are in the race. Tonight, for  the first time, these two prominent leaders square up in public  debate. We present to you F.W. de Klerk of the National Party  [NP] and Nelson Mandela of the African National Congress. The  debate will start with opening statements, followed by questions  from a panel of journalists. They are Tim Modise of Radio  Metro, Ferial Haffejee of SABC radio -- and of course, this  broadcast is also going out live on radio -- Lester Venter, the  SABC's political correspondent, and John Simpson, foreign editor  of the BBC. The toss of a coin determined that Mr. De Klerk  will start. Mr. Mandela will make the last closing statement.  Mr. De Klerk, you have the opportunity now of three minutes.    [De Klerk] Goeienaand [good evening], good evening,  sanibonani [good evening], dumelang [good evening]. In less  than two weeks, the South African nation will go to the polls,  for the first time ever really together, as a nation. As the  state president, it has been my privilege to lead the process  which brought us to this historic moment. In that, I have been  assisted by leaders from many other parties, also Mr. Mandela  here, and I pay tribute also to them.    I promised when I took office to guide South Africa to a new  era. I promised to end apartheid. I promised to release Mr.  Nelson Mandela. I promised a new constitution through  negotiation. I promised a free and fair election in which all  South Africans can participate with an equal vote. I promised  justice to all. I have kept that promise, and this has brought  us to a new beginning. The years of apartheid are over. A new  beginning awaits a new South Africa. Your vote will decide  whether that new beginning is a good one or a bad one. It will  be a good new beginning if the result of the election achieves a  balance of power between the two main contenders, the NP and the  ANC. If any one party gets too much power, it will be a bad  beginning, bad, also, for all South Africa. Our people who are  going to vote have the choice to make it a good beginning or a  bad one. The electorate in South Africa are deeply concerned  about a number of issues. Time only allows me briefly to deal  with two. I hope that during question time we can come back to  it. Our people are concerned about their jobs, about their  prosperity. They are concerned, deeply concerned, about the  social services and the lack of it, and they are concerned about  violence. If you vote for the new NP you will enable me to  continue with my task to bring conciliation, reconciliation, and  thus, peace and prosperity to our country and all its people. I  look forward to cooperate.    [Robinson] Thank you. Thank you Mr. de Klerk. [applause]  Mr. Mandela, you now have the opportunity of three minutes for  an opening statement.    [Mandela] My fellow South Africans. It is an honor for me to  appear here tonight on the eve of a historic election, when many  South Africans will claim...[pauses] reclaim their hopes for a  better life. I am humble to represent the work and struggle of  so many people who made democracy a reality in our country. It  is their good work that inspired me every day during those 27  years of my prison life. It is that good work that inspires me  tonight. I will resist the temptation to deal with issues which  are unimportant.    There is much at stake in this election, and I must use this  opportunity to state very clearly the very differences between  ourselves on our approach to the major national issues facing  this country. Those of you who are watching this discussion at  your homes, look to us to exercise effective leadership worthy  of the contribution and the sacrifices that we have made just to  bring about a little improvement in your own family, in the  difficult situation in which we live. The African National  Congress has put forward a thorough and realizable program of  action.    [Robinson] Thank you, Mr. Mandela. We must leave it there.  Now...[applause] Thank you. Now questions from our panel. The  two parties have agreed on a format in which the answers and  questions will be bound strictly by time. A candidate has two  minutes to answer a question from the panel. His opponent will  have two minutes to respond. Each will then get one minute to  make further statements. We start with Tim Modise putting the  first question to Mr. de Klerk. Tim.    [Modise] Well, thank you, Freek. Question to Mr. de Klerk:  Mr. De Klerk, violence, both political and criminal, poses a  number one threat to the elections, and over the past few years  it has continued unabated, and seemingly the government is  unable to deal with it. With that kind of record, as still  incumbent president, what guarantees do you give the electorate  tonight that violence will not get completely out of hand and  thus subvert the forthcoming elections?    [De Klerk] Thank you for the question, Tim. Let me start  out by saying I disagree with the analysis that the government  is not dealing effectively with it. Yes, there is too much  violence, but the government has taken extensive steps to deal  with it. In kwaZulu-Natal there is a state of emergency. In  the other trouble spot in South Africa, the PWV [Pretoria,  Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] area, but specifically Johannesburg  and surrounds, 11 districts have been declared as unrest areas.  We've increased the police force by almost from 75,000 to round  about 100,000.    The government is taking whatever steps are possible, but  its  task has been made very difficult by, inter alia, our main  opponent, the ANC, by their demonizing of the police force, by  driving a wedge between communities and the police force. Our  task has been made extremely difficult by the continued  existence and activities of the self- defense units and of  activities also of supporters of the ANC. I sit here with eight  extracts from the Goldstone reports, showing that the violence  in all eight instances -- and they were serious instances -- in  all eight instances was attributed to ANC supporters and Inkatha  supporters at each others' throats. That is not an easy problem  to solve. The government has done its duty in that regard.    If we look at the future, I believe that the election will  lay a basis for real reconciliation in South Africa. The  electoral strife will be over. It will be clear who are the  winners, who are the strong parties, and in a government of  national unity our approach will be to take hands with all those  who serve with us, and jointly to continue to deal with the  problem of violence.    [Robinson] Thank you, Mr. De Klerk. [applause] Mr. Mandela,  your response in two minutes.    [Mandela] I deal with this question on the basis that it is  the duty of the leadership to put before the public a total  picture. Any leader who is merely promoting the point of view of  his political party is not a leader who is going to help to pull  out South Africa from this mess. What I find unacceptable is  the fact that the president should misquote the report of Mr.  Goldstone, because if you look at his report, the police are  deeply involved in this violence. You have one of the top  police officers who has been suspended from his duties,  precisely because there are serious allegations against him, of  gun-running, of working with murderers, to murder innocent  people. I have discussed these issues with Mr. De Klerk on a  one-on-one basis, confidentially, provided him with evidence of  the activities of his police. There is one thing he does not  want to know; there is one thing that he covers very stubbornly,  and that is the involvement of senior police officials in this  violence. That is the proof. That is the total picture.  [applause]    [Robinson] Mr. De Klerk? Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. A  rebuttal from you, Mr. De Klerk.    [De Klerk] Yes. The fact of the matter is that the Goldstone  Commission was an initiative of the government, and I have  constantly said if there is any evidence of any involvement of  any members of the security forces in the fomenting of violence,  of them being partisan, of them being involved in violence and  political acts, then it must be reported to the Goldstone  Commission, and the Goldstone Commission, when it brought out  its report, I immediately acted. Can the ANC say the same with  regard to people who have been implicated by the Goldstone  Commission? They are high on the ANC's candidate lists. We  have taken, and will continue to take, firm action, if there is  any evidence. Lastly, the Goldstone report, in this instance,  referred to a small group of people. It does not refer to the  whole police force, and Judge Goldstone went out of his way to  emphasize that it is not the police force as such which is  involved. [applause]    [Robinson] Mr. Mandela, a final reply from you in one  minute.    [Mandela] Well, again Mr. de Klerk is not putting accurately  the report from Mr. Goldstone, because that report, whilst it  accepts that there are many policemen who are good, has actually  laid grave charges against senior police officers and I don't  accept the explanation which the state president has given. He  has much to explain than he has done. He is less than candid in  putting facts before the public. [applause]    [Robinson] I'm afraid there is no time left to have further  explanation on that particular issue. I now invite Ferial  Haffejee of SABC radio to put her question to Mr. Mandela.    [Haffejee] Good evening, Mr. Mandela.    [Mandela] Good evening.    [Haffejee] Everywhere you've gone on your election campaign  trail, you've promised--and people have demanded--jobs, houses,  and peace. But 7 million people don't have jobs, 3 million  don't have homes, and almost 300 people have died in political  and criminal violence in this month alone. Has yours been an  election campaign been a campaign trail of empty promises?    [Mandela] Not at all. We have got a plan to build a better  life for all South Africans, and a better life means housing,  jobs, free college education, hospital services. We believe  that these are realizable. The present budget of South Africa  is 126 billion rands. Last year, the National Party government  paid 10 billion rands for arms, guns, and tanks and only 2  million...[pauses] billion, for houses.    We are going to rearrange the budget so that we can be able  to address the basic needs of the masses of the people. We  believe that we have a very clear plan which has been discussed  not only with members of the liberation movements but with  government departments, with business, with academics, state  corporations, all of whom regard this plan as being reasonable  and which they support. For that reason we say that our plan is  realizable. [applause]    [Robinson] Mr. de Klerk ...[applause] Mr. de Klerk.... Thank  you. Mr. de Klerk, your response in two minutes.    [De Klerk] The National Party and the ANC have been  promising  very much the same things. We also promise houses, we also  promise better education, better health facilities, and more  jobs. The real test is: Who has a plan which can achieve it?  And I say that the National Party has a plan which can work  because we can only achieve that if we have dynamic economic  growth, and we can only have dynamic economic growth if we get  investments, and we'll only get investments and new factories  being built and increased economic activity if we follow  economic policies which are in step with our policy, because our  policy is in step with the economic policies which have  succeeded across this world.    The ANC's policy is riddled with that which has failed. It  is riddled still with clinging to nationalization. You won't  get investments as long as that is the case. The ANC continues  to talk about stronger government intervention and more central  ... centralist control. Those economic policies will not  succeed in generating the wealth which we need. The ANC's plan  is going to cost much more than they indicate.    I've had an independent investigation done. In the first  year, implementation of that plan will cost 70 billion rand.  That 70 billion rand is just a little bit less than the total  income from personal income tax of the state. It means that the  taxpayers' income tax will be doubled if we have to raise the 70  billion and that their tax on cigarettes, on beer, on petrol  will also be doubled. It is not affordable and  therefore...[pauses] and you can't save it from the defense  budget. Mr. Mandela is bringing in 12,000 new MK's [Umkhonto we  Sizwe -- ANC Military Wing] into the defense force. The defense  budget is going to rise and not deplete, therefore, we will have  to generate wealth and that is the only way.    [Robinson] Mr. de Klerk, the clock demands that I stop you  there. Mr. Mandela, you can respond in one minute.    [Mandela] This is the reply of a man who is not used to  addressing the basic needs of the majority of the population,  whose government is committed to a small minority. He is  alarmed that we have to devote so much resources to blacks,  whose concerns they don't care for.    [Robinson] Ladies and gentlemen, can I please ask you to  give  Mr. Mandela an opportunity. We've agreed there will be no  interjections. Thank you, Mr. Mandela. Go ahead.    [Mandela] That is the reason why Mr. de Klerk has consulted  some unspecified people to conduct a study. Again, I say Mr. de  Klerk is less than candid in analyzing national issues. We have  produced at length, we have circulated to everybody, including  government officials. Where is their plan? Where is it?  [applause]    [Robinson] Mr. de Klerk, you have one minute. Thank you,  thank you, ladies and gentlemen. One minute.    [De Klerk] Mr. Mandela, our plan is absolutely on the table,  and it has been accepted by the National Housing Forum. It was  basically impeded by the ANC and ANC-supported organizations.  They did not want the plan to be realized. We have a plan  which will draw in those billions of rands from the private  sector. We have a good housing plan on the table, which will  achieve all those results. I care for all South Africans,  irrespective of their race or color.    But let me say, Mr. Mandela, my comments were not the  comments of a man who is less than candid. They were the  comments of somebody with experience, of somebody who sat in the  cabinet and worked through budgets since 1978, and who knows how  the economy of the state works. And there is... No, it wasn't  apartheid. We abolished apartheid, we made the country free,  we...[applause]    [Robinson] Ladies and gentlemen, please give him an  opportunity.    [De Klerk] I'm giving you the assurance, when you share  responsibility in that government of national unity, you will  realize that we have over the past 4 years already cut the  budget to the bone.    [Robinson] Thank you, Mr. de Klerk. Lester Venter, our  political correspondent, has the opportunity now to put a  question to Mr. de Klerk.    [Venter] Thank you, Freek. Mr. de Klerk, you said earlier  that the election will determine which is the strongest party.  Now if that is not the NP, then in two weeks' time you will be  a former state president of South Africa, and in fact that will  be a direct consequence of the process that you yourself set in  motion four years ago.    But of the many consequences to be counted in that process,  South Africa today is one of the most violent places in the  world. You've accused your political adversaries of bringing  into government an out-dated ideology -- namely, communism  itself. As you stand today with these prospects ahead of you,  are you happy with the way things have turned out for that  process that you set in motion, and are you content, in fact, to  now take a subservient role if it so turns out in that  government?    [De Klerk] Thank you, Lester. Let me start out by saying the  NP has become the most representative nonracial party in South  Africa. We are growing by the day, and we are going to come up  with a dramatic result, so don't be too sure in the assumptions  that you've made. But if the ANC turns out to be the party with  the largest slice of the vote, we'll firstly be very near to  them. Second, I will become executive deputy president, not at  the behest of the ANC, but in terms of the constitution, and I  will be representing, in that government of national unity,  proudly, millions and millions of moderate South Africans, and I  will be putting their case, and I will be looking after their  interests, and I will be cooperating with the other parties,  because that is what the government of national unity is about,  that we should rise above our political differences and address  the challenges which we face in this country, address the needs  of all our people.    It is in that spirit that I say, yes, I'm happy with the way  it has turned out. There was no other alternative for South  Africa. We were on the road to total confrontation, which would  have annihilated everything which has been built up in this  country. We have negotiated a good, balanced constitution with  checks and balances. The power of politicians are effectively  limited. There will not be any form of suppression. The courts  will be independent. We have a good bill of rights in that  constitution. There will be power-sharing, there will be  devolution, there will be federalism. Yes, I'm happy with what  we achieved, and I have confidence in the future.    [Robinson] Mr. Mandela your reply.    [Mandela] It is a source of great concern when those who  claim to be experienced make vague and starry-eyed claims which  have no basis, whatsoever. I must say that the African National  Congress is an organization with more than 80 years of building  national unity in this country. [applause]    [Robinson, interrupting] Thank, you. Thank you.    [Mandela, continuing] There is no organization in this  country as divisive as the so-called New National Party of my  friend on my left. It is actually promoting racial hatred. I  hope...[audience murmurs]    [Robinson, interrupting] Please, ladies and gentlemen.  Please.    [Mandela, continuing] I hope I'll be able to demonstrate now  how they are trying to turn the colored community against the  African people...[audience murmurs] through slogans which are  totally without foundation and where the Independent Elections  Commission has condemned the National Party for promoting  inflammatory and racist attitudes in the community. That is the  so-called New National Party. That is the false claim of  building unity which my friend is making. I reject that  totally. [applause]    [Robinson] Mr. De Klerk you have one minute to reply.    [De Klerk] I would like to start out by telling Mr. Mandela  that the National Party support base amongst the so-called  coloreds is a spontaneous, warm, and very strong support base.  We have proven, in our relationship within the party, that  reconciliation can work. I didn't have to intervene as leader  to get a colored person appointed into an important position in  the Western Cape as Mr. Mandela had to do because his own  supporters wouldn't elect one. We have a good relationship and  the colored are our people, my people. They are South Africans.  They are wonderful people, and I totally reject the accusation  that the National Party is racist. I don't have 150,000-rand  fines against me in the National Party for intimidation, as the  ANC now has. [applause]    [Robinson] Mr. De Klerk, time demands that we stop there.  Mr. Mandela, a final rebuttal from yourself.    [Mandela] This document, Die Winde van Verandering [The  Winds  of Change], is full of the most scandalous, outrageous, racist  allegations, where they say the slogan of the African National  Congress is: Kill the coloreds, kill the Boer. I challenge Mr.  De Klerk to renounce that statement now.    [De Klerk, interrupting] I have, last night.    [Mandela, continuing] If he is less than candid. Last night,  when you knew you were coming to this debate. [applause,  laughter]    [Robinson] We must leave it there -- unfortunately, as we've  agreed in the format of this program. And now we go to John  Simpson, the foreign editor of the BBC to put his question to  Mr. Mandela.    [Simpson] Mr. Mandela I hope you'll forgive my being frank.  I'm thinking very much of the kind of people who are watching  this program in other countries than South Africa. Many of them  are going to see the National Party [as heard] as a party with a  past that has not always been very good, or very democratic, not  always been nonviolent in many ways, even within its own  organization. They are going to see that you've made a number of  very large election promises which have raised the expectations  of people a great deal in this country and they are going to  wonder, frankly, whether South Africa under your presidency  won't be heading down the same road that many other countries in  black Africa have. Will you...will you, for instance, borrow  money on the scale that so many other countries have -- Zimbabwe  for instance. How will you deal with this problem?    [Robinson] Mr. Mandela?    [Mandela] South Africa is not a poor country. As I have  said, our budget this year is 126 billion rands. We also are  going to reorganize the budget, restructure the budget, in order  to avoid the wastage of apartheid. We will be able to use the  country's resources in a more efficient manner, and to prevent  the corruption which is so endemic in the NP government.    [Robinson] Please, ladies and gentlemen...    [Mandela] The gravy train where most of the funds of the  country had gone has come to an end. We have committed  ourselves to leaders trying to lead a style of life similar to  those of the community. We are going...[pauses] I am going to  suggest that my own salary, if I am elected as state president,  must be cut. [applause] I am doing that, unlike the NP  government, which has paid, attempted to pay, large sums to the  director generals when there are 5 million people unemployed,  when there are 7 million people without houses. We are not  going to live like fat cats. My friends in the NP can do that.  That's what they know.    [Robinson] Mr. de Klerk? A response from Mr. de Klerk.    [De Klerk] May I at the outset say that our deficit before  borrowing is much too high. If we want to be in step and  attract foreign investment and be sure of the support of the IMF  and the World Bank, we will have to continue in South Africa to  maintain strict fiscal and financial discipline. This is what  the government has@?en doing. By doing it and by taking other  steps we brought down the inflation rate to single-digit  figures, and soon it might be 7 percent. We've brought down  interest rates. All our economic indicators are pointing in the  right direction.    I'm very glad to hear that in the government of national  unity I will have the support of Mr. Mandela in being frugal  with regard to government expenses, but then we must be frugal  across the board, because it is at the moment organizations  allied to the ANC who are once again doing damage to the South  African economy by strikes with regard to various disciplines.  And through those strikes they are first helping to create an  atmosphere which is not conducive to free and fair elections,  and second, they are harming the economic interests of the  country. So I'm glad to hear that he's committed to fiscal and  financial discipline. He won't have any difficulty with me in  achieving that, but if he thinks that he can save on the salary  of politicians enough to solve the economic challenges which we  have in South Africa, then he's in for a big surprise. [applause]    [Robinson] Thank you for your cooperation. Mr. Mandela, you  can have a rebuttal.    [Mandela] Obviously Mr. de Klerk was not listening when I  was  speaking. I may as well add that I'm happy he is going to  cooperate with me if I say a state president should pay a tax on  his income, on his resources, on his purse. That is what heads  of state do throughout the Western world, not in South Africa.  We are also going to issue government bonds, reconstruction  bonds, both in South Africa and abroad, to raise the funds that  we need. We are going to impose a fair tax to be paid by  everybody. All these are going to help to get revenue for the  country, but we are not going to live like fat cats. The days  of the gravy trains are gone. Everybody should know that.  [applause]    [Robinson] Mr. de Klerk, your final reply.    [De Klerk] I was under the impression that the ANC has  promised lower taxes for everybody in its manifesto. Bonds  which you raise also carry interest with them. One of the  biggest problems of South Africa is that the fastest growing  item in our budget has been the interest on loans. Every loan  that you take out needs to be repaid, and who repays it? The  taxpayer. Therefore, we need across the board to ensure that we  maintain fiscal discipline. That is the economic solution for  the future. I've been listening very carefully to what Mr.  Mandela has said, and I'm very glad that we're going to have a  government of national unity, because it is clear that our  experience will be absolutely essential if we want to have good  government in South Africa.    [Robinson] We now move on to the next question. John  Simpson again of the BBC, foreign editor. Your question now to  Mr. De Klerk.    [Simpson] Another frank one, if I may. In February 1990, you  assured white voters that they would have a part to play in the  future political development of the country. At the end of your  negotiations with the ANC, Mr. Joe Slovo of the ANC-South  African Communist Party came out and said, I think, the Nats  [National Party] caved in at the end. By 1999, perhaps earlier,  you won't be part of the national...[pauses] of the government  of national unity. Is it possible, do you think, that whites in  South Africa will then perform the same function that they do  in, say, Kenya or Zimbabwe, that's to say they earn the money,  earn some of the money, but they don't have any part to play,  whatever, in the political process of the country?    [Robinson] Mr. de Klerk?    [De Klerk] The answer is a frank no. I'm white, but I'm no  longer the leader of a white party. I don't represent white  interests. I represent a value system and my party has support  across the board from all population groups, colors [pauses]  ...colors, creeds, and races in South Africa. If my party is  not the biggest party in this election, it will definitely be so  in the next election. [applause] And the whites within the  National Party and many other whites, also supporting other  parties like the DP [Democratic Party], don't look upon  themselves as a little group of people who are going to sit in a  corner, divorcing themselves of South Africa and its problems  and its people. We are part of a South African nation. Color  in the National Party's vocabulary has become unimportant. What  is important is: What do you believe in? We believe in free  enterprise. We believe in good family values. We believe in  real peace. We believe in reconciliation. We believe in  Christian norms and standards and that is bringing together all  the people across the old divisions from all the population  groups, into our party, and that is giving an impetus to our  party which assures that for those who believe in this value  system, which has proven itself across the world, which is in  step with the successful part of the world, will become the  dominant political factor. The ANC is a conglomeration. It's  going to rip apart because they don't have a clear philosophy.  They live in the past. [applause]    [Robinson] Your reply, Mr. Mandela. You have two minutes.    [Mandela] It is quite clear that we are dealing with  somebody  who either does not know what he is talking about. If he does  what he...[pauses] if he does know what he is talking about, he  does not care. In the first place, it's a false statement to  suggest that any one individual started the negotiation process  in February. Everybody knows that negotiation is the result of  the suffering of the masses of the people [applause] --  supported by the international community. It is them who came  out to the streets, called strikes, boycotts, who were shot and  killed by the racist security police of the National Party, who  threw us in jail, who turned our lives into nightmares. Those  are the forces who have brought about these changes in this  country. We have been dragging Mr. de Klerk and the National  Party, screaming, not wanting to come forward with us on this  process. There are various examples which we can quote but we  are happy....[pauses] I'm happy that we are working together. I  met him three times in prison. We agreed to work together, and  that is what I am committed to in spite of all the differences  that we have. [applause]    [Robinson] Mr. de Klerk, your rebuttal in one minute.    [De Klerk] The National Party changed its policy to its  present policy three and a half years before Mr. Mandela was  released from jail, in 1986. Secondly, Mr. Mandela can't bluff  with these accusations. The families of the victims of the  necklace murders which we had from supporters of his  organization, the people in the townships who are suppressed and  intimidated by the SDU's [self- defense units] -- they know who  are suppressing them. The people whose houses have been burned  down know who are the guilty ones, and the parents of the  children whose lives have been ruined by the misuse of education  by the ANC know who caused the misery for their children.  [applause]    [Robinson] Mr. Mandela?    [Mandela] This election is about securing a better life for  our people. That is what the ANC is concentrating upon. Mr. de  Klerk is alarmed because he is a leader of a party which even  today is maintaining apartheid. He is spending three times, in  education, on a white child than he does on a black child. What  is the reason? What is his reason if apartheid has died? He  has not built houses for Africans for more than 10 years. What  is the reason for that discrimination? I cannot vote. There  are 5 million people unemployed.    [Robinson] Mr. Mandela, with respect to you, you need to  finish. We must unfortunately leave it there. May I point out  to our audience, to the extent, of course, that you are clapping  and egging your leaders on, that you are also taking their time.  May I please ask our political correspondent, Lester Venter,  now to put his question to Mr. Mandela.    [Venter] Thank you. Mr. Mandela, the Inkatha Freedom Party's  decision to stay out of the election, the Zulu king's claim for  an independent kingdom, and the associated tensions and the  violence that arise from this situation seem to be problems that  will not go away soon. In fact, this country could end up with  a secessionist struggle waged from kwaZulu. If, when you are in  power, how do you plan to deal with this matter?    [Mandela] I have maintained constant dialogue with the IFP,  as well as with His Majesty, the Zulu king. I attach a great  deal of importance to peaceful solutions of problems, and I  think that it has now been demonstrated that that is a very  powerful weapon. I am going to continue to talk to the IFP, to  the Zulu monarch. But the situation that is taking place now in  kwaZulu-Natal where there is no free political activity in many  areas in that country, where people are dying by scores, have  compelled us to link the political initiative and security  measures together. We regret that, because we would like to  emphasize, to concentrate, on the peaceful initiative. We are  doing that now. We will do that after 27 April. We will have  formidable resources of being able to ensure that we reinforce  our political initiatives as a government which exercises state  power. [applause] I hope we will succeed.    [Robinson] Mr. de Klerk, you have two minutes to reply.    [De Klerk] On this issue there has lately been very good  cooperation between the government, the NP government, and the  ANC, and specifically between the two of us. I welcome that. I  was critical earlier on. I felt that the ANC did not do enough  with regard to Inkatha, but that is in the past. We have met in  the Kruger National Park. It was an important meeting. We have  made certain proposals, the ANC came forward also with  constructive proposals. Inkatha and the Zulu king also came  with specific proposals, and if you analyze the proposals from  all three sides, there is already really a clear framework for  consensus and for agreement.    We then agreed, with regard to the monarchy, to form a  working group. That working group has reported back to its  principals, and I think it is a good report, I can live with it.  I have some criticism, but basically I can live with it, and I  would like to thank all those who made an input. So I think the  problem of the Zulu monarch can, within the framework of the  transitional constitution and the principals, be really  accommodated in a very dignified way, and we need not be worried  that that problem cannot be solved.    Inkatha is, in the words of Chief Minister Buthelezi  himself,  not a Zulu party. My analysis is that Inkatha has made major  mistakes by not participating. I have bent over backwards from  time to time, making new suggestions how to bring them aboard.  Together with the multiparty forum we have called Parliament  together, changed the constitution, and brought in five, six  fundamental changes which really accommodated their most potent  objections to the first version of December.    [Robinson] I'm obliged to stop you there, Mr. de Klerk.  Mr. Mandela, the last few words on this matter.    [Mandela] We must also assess...[pauses] always assess the  statements made by Mr. de Klerk about the Inkatha Freedom Party  -- that this is his former ally. They used funds, state funds,  in order to finance the murderous activities of the Inkatha  Freedom Party. [audience murmurs] Mr. De Klerk admitted in July  1991 that they had given 8 million rands of our taxes, of our  money, to Inkatha. He admitted that. He had earlier admitted  that they had given 250,000 rands to Inkatha. Always assess his  statements with regards to Inkatha against that background.  [applause]    [Robinson] Mr. De Klerk?    [De Klerk] I find the sudden aggression of Mr. Mandela on  this issue strange. It is the one thing that we have been  cooperating well on. Can I just say that Mr. Mandela is  referring to historical situations. I have stopped all the  covert actions, and the Kahn committee under Professor Kahn has  monitored it has assured me now that he is happy with the way in  which all the covert activities which took place without my  knowledge have been properly put under the table and it's  finished. Can I just say that as far as Inkatha is concerned,  we are near to each other because they also believe in free  enterprise, because they also believe in federalism. It is a  policy bond, yes, which exists between us, but this government  does not fund murderous activities. [applause]    [Robinson] Time is up on this issue. Thank you, ladies and  gentlemen. I invite again now Ferial Haffejee of SABC radio to  put the question to Mr. de Klerk.    [Haffejee] Thank you, Freek. Mr. de Klerk, many people  believe that your government has not been accountable. There  have been three years of Third Force allegations; nobody has  taken the rap for it, although you may have appointed a number  of commissions. Many billions of rands have been lost to  corruption; again, nobody has taken the rap for it. How do we  ensure accountability in the future, especially under a  government of national unity where there is no opposition  watchdog?    [De Klerk] The National Party government has already put  into  place the instruments to ensure that accountability. We have  strengthened the position of the auditor general. We have made  him more independent. We have appointed an ombudsman, and we  have given that ombudsman more powers. Apart from all the  commissions that we've instituted, we've built into the  financial and administrative control system absolute improved  systems to ensure that this is properly dealt with. But most of  the corruption that you refer to took place in some of the  homelands, and if you analyze the reports you will find that the  emphasis was, for instance, on Lebowa and on kwaNdebele. Those  two homelands were run by Chief Minister Ramodike and Chief  Minister Mahlangu. They are now on the ANC's candidate list --  [laughter] -- well knowing, well knowing that that corruption  took place under their administration. I am against corruption  and I have a proud record -- this government has a proud record  -- of absolutely, fearlessly following up every allegation of  corruption, and whenever anyone was found to be guilty, firm  steps were taken. Accountability of the government comes into  being when there was negligence or where there is knowledge, and  in none of these instances has any government member been  accused of negligence or of having had knowledge of the  corruption which was uncovered.    [Robinson] Mr. Mandela, your response.    [Mandela] There is no transparency or accountability insofar  as the National Party government. When we held a commission of  inquiry into allegations of violation of human rights, we  published our report. We took South Africa into confidence. He  appointed a commission, General Pierre Steyn, to investigate the  activities of the MI [Military Intelligence]. He did dismiss  certain officers. I then asked him to give me that report,  because I said to him that report has got confirmation of the  existence of the Third Force. I have not got that report from  him even now. I am the leader of the most important political  voice in this country. I started negotiations [audience  murmurs] when I was in jail. I discussed it with...I discussed  it with Kobie Coetsee, quite apart from the contribution of the  masses of the people, but he has not given me that report. The  reason, because it has got concrete evidence of the existence of  the Third Force. That is the reason why there is no  transparency in the statement which Mr. De Klerk is making -- is  less than candid. That is the reality. [applause]    [Robinson] Opportunity for a rebuttal, Mr. de Klerk? You  have one minute.    [De Klerk] Minister Coetsee and I have explained -- I think,  now, three times -- the situation with regard to the so-called  Steyn report, and I'm really not going to do it. I only have a  minute. It wasn't a report of that nature, but I took steps.  There was a transparency with regard to the commission's report  on the detention camps, but were they acted against by the ANC?  No, they're once again high up on the candidates' list. The  very people who have been implicated by that commission are now  maybe ministerial candidates in the government of national  unity, having been implicated by that commission. The ANC  should take steps against their supporters who make themselves  guilty of atrocities or any unacceptable behavior. That is what  we are doing constantly. [applause]    [Robinson] Opportunity for a final reply, Mr. Mandela.    [Mandela] He has completely evaded my question. I am saying:  If that report was innocent, he would have published it, he  would have given it to me. I am his partner. We are trying to  solve this problem together. We are trying to promote mutual  confidence so that we, the two of us and other players, can  persuade a government of national unity to build this mutual  confidence, to proceed with the task of nation-building. He has  not given me that report. Why? [applause]    [Robinson] We must leave the issue there. Now for the final  question from my colleague, also from Radio Metro, Tim Modise,  and it goes to Mr. Man?ela.    [Modise] Thank you, Freek. Mr. Mandela, we've been listening  to the promises of the ANC and the NP tonight. The ordinary man  and woman in the street is watching this and is listening. They  want to know are they going to feel safe on the streets after  the government of national unity has been elected? They want to  know if there will be delivery of social services, given the  strikes that have been taking place, especially in the  homelands? They want to know if public violence and criminal  violence is going to be eradicated completely in South Africa.  Above that, they want to know if there will ever be racial  reconciliation in this country.    [Mandela] The ANC is committed to national reconciliation  and  to nation-building. There is no organization in this country  which has issued a policy statement to compare with the Freedom  Charter, which is the most devastating attack on all forms of  racialism. We have come out with a clear program to ensure a  better life, to build houses, to offer employment, to provide  free, quality education. But you must remember that violence is  not caused by those who carry a gun, by those who stab. It is  also caused by poverty, illiteracy, hunger. All these are evils  of apartheid. We are going to address these problems, and  restructure the police force so that it could be a community  police. [applause]    [Robinson] Mr. de Klerk?    [De Klerk] I and the National Party share the deep concern  of  all our people about the violence -- and within the government  of national unity which will no longer have any legitimacy  problem -- I believe that we will be able to address it through,  firstly, restructuring, improving the economy -- if our policy  is followed then we will succeed with that.    Unemployment is one of the problems of crime and violence.  The so-called lost generation, the millions of young South  Africans, mostly of them black, who are not properly trained,  who left school early -- they need to be looked at, and at an  earlier occasion Mr. Mandela and I have already talked about it,  that in the government of national unity we will have to address  this problem in an imaginative way.    Yes, I believe that through economic growth, through  improvement of social conditions which can then be afforded  because there is economic growth, we can improve the quality of  life of our people.    We have already started to improve the relationships between  the police and the community, and I'm fully in favor of  community policing and the new constitution makes provision for  that. I hope that the election will also bring to an end the  demonization of our police force. We only have one police force  in South Africa. One-third of them are at the moment almost  full-time busy in preventing or fighting or managing political  unrest and political violence. Hopefully, when the election is  over those policemen and women will also be able, once again, to  concentrate on crime prevention and on accosting criminals and  on bringing them to book. I really believe that the election  will bring us to the end of this violent period.    [Robinson] Thank you Mr. de Klerk. I must stop you there.  [applause] Mr. de Klerk, we are doing very well on time. You  are very disciplined, both of you. I will give you  one-and-a-half minutes each now to respond. Mr. Mandela.    [Mandela] The exchanges between Mr. de Klerk and I should  not  ... not obscure one important fact about our country. I think  we are a shining example to the entire world of people drawn  from different racial groups who have a common loyalty, a common  love, to their common country. That is the dominating issue.  We are going to fight these issues out, but we have men and  women in this country who have reason -- who are honoring the  ideals of liberty and democracy in this country, and in spite of  my criticism of Mr. de Klerk, Sir, you are one of those I rely  upon, that we are going to face the problems of this country,  together, and with other....[applause]    [De Klerk] Thank you for those kind words, Mr. Mandela. I  am also...[pauses] I can also testify that on major issues such  as nation building we are finding it possible to work together.  Can I say that we won't have peace before we have real  reconciliation? This election is about the future. It is not  about the past, and until we bury the bitterness of the past,  until....[pauses] One can never forget injustice, but you can  forgive. And we need forgiveness, we need reconciliation, we  need to put our hands in each others' hands, and all the  population groups need to say: We need each other, we have a  common destiny, let us work together. And that is why I am so  satisfied that we have agreed upon a government of national  unity, because that is the instrument we need to lead this  country toward that nationhood which will make us all proud  South Africans and which will ensure that we as a country will  move forward together. [applause]    [Robinson] Well, thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Well, with  that we come to the end of the question and answer session. I  will now ask each of you to have a final closing statement. We  have some time. I will give you four minutes. Mr. De Klerk, as  agreed, you will go first.    [De Klerk] Having come to the end of this debate, I would  like to appeal to all the voters out there -- firstly, who have  not decided as yet for whom to vote -- to seriously consider  their position. We need a balance of power. There is only one  party which can form that balance of power against the ANC,  which is a strong party with wide support -- they are the  favorite -- and that is the National Party. It is the new  National Party, notwithstanding what has been said. It is a  party which has renewed itself from within. It was an internal  process; we have cleansed ourselves from within. We have  admitted that our past policy led to injustice. We have  apologized for that and we say: We have a job to do; we also  want to rectify those injustices. This new National Party is a  growing party. This new National Party is fighting to become  the biggest party, not for jobs for ourselves, but because we  believe in the values for which we stand.    We believe in sound family values. We believe that parents  should still be parents and that children shouldn't deal with  parents and grown-ups as is happening in our country at the  moment. We believe in Christian norms and standards. We believe  in free enterprise. We believe in universal human rights and  feel that the Bill of Rights needs to be strengthened. We  believe in religious freedom, and we care about the needs of our  people. We know many people are suffering. We must accept the  challenge to fight hunger, to fight poverty, to ensure that more  and more jobs will be created, to build homes for the homeless,  to improve the quality of education, to bring primary health  care nearer to the people. We have accepted it as a party, and  we will work together with all those who also stand for that.    And on peace -- we are committed to peace. Our hands are  clean. The National Party, none of the National Party supporters  are involved in violence. We are a peaceful party, and  everybody who knows our party can testify as to that. And if  one of our party members gets out of line, we discipline him.    The National Party believes in the future of this country  and  all its people. We see our country on the threshold of a new,  wonderful, prosperous era. The whole of Africa wants us to  succeed. The whole of Africa is reaching out toward a successful  conclusion of the process in South Africa, because Africa needs  us. The international community wants us to succeed because  they realize that South Africa has a pivotal role to play, not  only in Africa, but also globally. The whole world is waiting  for us to succeed because what we have embarked upon in South  Africa -- all the leaders of all the parties together -- has not  succeeded in many countries elsewhere. There is a way, and that  way is the real tolerance and the real commitment to peace, and  the adherence to workable policies which have succeeded  elsewhere. That is the way, and that is the way of the new  National Party for which I ask the support of all the voters out  there. [applause]    [Robinson] Thank you. Mr. Mandela, the final closing  statement from you.    [Mandela] To deal with my statement, I would have liked to  know from Mr. De Klerk, who was disciplined when 8 million of  tax payers' money was given to Inkatha Freedom Party? [sentence  as heard] That was in July 1991. Who was disciplined? His  vague statements are counterproductive, because they lead to the  conclusion that Mr. De Klerk is less than frank in making  important statements on national issues.    But I want to say that various points of view have been  expressed here. I want to assure you that on the 27th of April  you will make your choice, and I don't doubt what it is going to  be. The choice will be whether you want the same problems to  continue within the next five years -- massive unemployment,  limited opportunities, continued racial division -- or whether  you want the beginning of a new era of hope, of peace, of  security, where the basic needs of everybody have been attended  to.    Here, we are saying the ANC has the most cogent plan to deal  with this situation. The fact that Mr. De Klerk when we asked  for his comprehensive plan to deal with these basic needs, he  can only tell us of some document he has given. There is no  evidence at all of the circulation. I have never received it.  He has never given to me. I have been with him very frequently.  Where is their plan? With whom was it discussed?    But we are saying: Let us work together. Let us work  together for reconciliation and nation building. I am proud to  hold your hands...for us to go forward. [applause] Let us work  together to end division and suspicion. I have traveled  throughout this country, spoken to thousands of people. I know  that they deserve a better life. They deserve a better future.  And the only organization I am calling upon you to vote for is  the African National Congress. [applause] If you vote for the  African National Congress, you are voting for an organization  which has got an experience of more than 80 years in nation  building. It's an organization which will never issue documents  of this nature, which today in 1994 says, Boesak, why are you  not with your people? Why are you with Africans? It is the  most divisive party in this country. If you want national  unity, that is the organization I lead -- the African National  Congress.    [Robinson] Thank you, Mr. Mandela. We must leave it there.  Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you. May I thank both  of you for the spirit of this debate, and with that we come to  the end of this historic from the Johannesburg Civic Theater  Complex. We bid you good night.     "

'Let me tell you there will be no postponement of elections  ..either in the province of Natal or in any of the provinces,' Mr Mandela told a youth conference in Durban. Some 700 additional troops were last night on their way to bolster the 2,000 soldiers already enforcing the state of emergency in Natal, where over 100 people have died in six days. A government spokesman said last night the Natal crisis required a political solution, which will be the focus of tomorrow's peace summit between Mr Mandela, President F W de Klerk, Inkatha leader Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi and Zulu King Goodwill Zwelethini.

Today we  celebrate not the victory of a party, but a victory for all the  people of South Africa.    Our country has arrived at a decision. Among all the parties  that contested the elections, the overwhelming majority of South  Africans have mandated the African National Congress to lead our  country into the future. The South Africa we have struggled  for, in which all our people, be they African, coloured, Indian  or white, regard themselves as citizens of one nation is at hand.    Perhaps it was history that ordained that it be here, at the  Cape of Good Hope that we should lay the foundation stone of our  new nation. For it was here at this Cape, over three centuries  ago, that there began the fateful convergence of the peoples of  Africa, Europe and Asia on these shores. It was to this  peninsula that the patriots, among them many princes and  scholars, of Indonesia were dragged in chains. It was on the  sandy plains of this peninsula that first battles of the epic  wars of resistance were fought.    When we look out across Table Bay, the horizon is dominated  by Ro?ben Island, whose infamy as a dungeon built to stifle the  spirit of freedom is as old as colonialism in South Africa. For  three centuries that island was seen as a place to which  outcasts can be banished. The names of those who were  incarcerated on Robben Island is a roll call of resistance  fighters and democrats spanning over three centuries. If indeed  this is a Cape of Good Hope, that hope owes much to the spirit  of that legion of fighters and others of their calibre.    We have fought for a democratic constitution since the  1880s.  Ours has been a quest for a constitution freely adopted by the  people of South Africa, reflecting their wishes and their  aspirations. The struggle for democracy has never been a matter  pursued by one race, class, religious community or gender among  South Africans. In honouring those who fought to see this day  arrive, we honour the best sons and daughters of all our people.  We can count amongst them Africans, coloureds, whites, Indians,  Muslims, Christians, Hindus, Jews -- all of them united by a  common vision of a better life for the people of this country.    It was that vision that inspired us in 1923 when we adopted  the first ever bill of rights in this country. That same vision  spurred us to put forward the African claims in 1946. It is  also the founding principle of the Freedom Charter we adopted as  policy in 1955, which in its very first lines, places before  South Africa an inclusive basis for citizenship.    In the 1980s the African National Congress was still  setting the pace, being the first major political formation in  South Africa to commit itself firmly to a bill of rights, which  we published in November 1990. These milestones give concrete  expression to what South Africa can become. They speak of a  constitutional, democratic, political order in which, regardless  of colour, gender, religion, political opinion or sexual  orientation, the law will provide for the equal protection of  all citizens.    They project a democracy in which the government, whomever  that government may be, will be bound by a higher set of rules,  embodied in a constitution, and will not be able govern the  country as it pleases.    Democracy is based on the majority principle. This is  especially true in a country such as ours where the vast  majority have been systematically denied their rights. At the  same time, democracy also requires that the rights of political  and other minorities be safeguarded.    In the political order we have established there will be  regular, open and free elections, at all levels of government -  central, provincial and municipal. There shall also be a social  order which respects completely the culture, language and  religious rights of all sections of our society and the  fundamental rights of the individual.    The task at hand on will not be easy. But you have mandated  us to change South Africa from a country in which the majority  lived with little hope, to one in which they can live and work  with dignity, with a sense of self-esteem and confidence in the  future. The cornerstone of building a better life of  opportunity, freedom and expression is the most dynamic program  of social upliftment in the history of this country. The  Reconstruction and Development Programme -- this needs unity of  purpose. It needs unity in action. It requires us all to work  together to bring an end to division, an end to suspicion and  build a nation united in our diversity.    The people of South Africa have spoken in these elections.  They want change! And change is what they will get. Our plan  is to create jobs, promote peace and reconciliation, and to  guarantee freedom for all South Africans. We will tackle the  widespread poverty so pervasive among the majority of our  people. By encouraging investors and the democratic state to  support job creating projects in which manufacturing will play a  central role we will try to change our country from a net  exporter of raw materials to one that exports finished products  through beneficiation.    The government will devise policies that encourage and  reward  productive enterprise among the disadvantaged communities -  African, coloured and Indian. By easing credit conditions we  can assist them to make inroads into the productive and  manufacturing spheres and breakout of the small-scale  distribution to which they are presently confined.    To raise our country and its people from the morass of  racism  and apartheid will require determination and effort. As a  government, the ANC will create a legal framework that will  assist, rather than impede, the awesome task of reconstruction  and development of our battered society.    While we are and shall remain fully committed to the spirit  of a government of national unity, we are determined to initiate  and bring about the change that our mandate from the people  demands.    We place our vision of a new constitutional order for South  Africa on the table not as conquerors, prescribing to the  conquered. We speak as fellow citizens to heal the wounds of the  past with the intent of constructing a new order based on  justice for all.    This is the challenge that faces all South Africans today,  and it is one to which I am certain we will all rise.     "

By LEE MAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER      ATLANTA      The cloud hanging over the South Carolina Legislature burst dramatically Friday  as five lawmakers were indicted on federal charges that they ""sold their votes  for cash.""    A federal grand jury in Columbia, the state capital, returned felony  indictments against state Sen. William Lee and state Reps.

""The indictments, simply put, allege that each of these public officials sold  their votes for cash,"" U.S. Atty. Bart Daniel said in a statement in Columbia.  He said also that there will be more indictments.    The indictments result from a 16-month investigation that included a sting  operation, code-named Operation Lost Trust.    Investigators charge that lobbyist Ronald Cobb, working undercover for the FBI,  offered thousands of dollars in cash to the legislators -- and they took it.  Cobb, a cigar-smoking, back-slapping former state legislator, allegedly  conducted the transactions in a Columbia hotel room.    The case had cast a pall over the capital since it came to light last month  that federal agents had subpoenaed the spending records of every one of the  state's 124 House members and 46 senators.

In South  Carolina, politicians are allowed to accept unlimited cash contributions, and  lobbyists are not required to itemize the contributions. By contrast, North  Carolina allows a candidate to accept no more than $100 in cash.    In commenting on the likelihood that reforms will be enacted, First Assistant  U.S. Atty.

John Harley, special agent in charge of the FBI in South Carolina, confirmed  that meetings with legislators were recorded on audiotape and videotape and  that a phony business was used as a front.    Sting operations similar to the one in South Carolina have been aimed at  lawmakers in several states, including California.    In Columbia, the five legislators are charged with violating the federal Hobbs  Act, which makes it illegal for a public official to accept money as an  inducement for promising to perform an official act.    The one-count indictment against Lee alleges that he accepted ""a $2,000 cash  bribe"" for his support of the parimutuel betting bill that was pending during  the 1990 legislative session. Winstead is charged with one count of accepting  $1,000 and another count of obstruction of justice. Brown is charged with one  count of taking $2,000. Kohn is charged with one count of conspiracy, alleging  that he agreed to accept cash and to recruit colleagues to support the betting  bill. Taylor is charged with one count of conspiracy and five counts of  accepting cash totaling $2,500.    Each count carries a maximum sentence of 20 years' imprisonment and a fine of  $250,000.

THOMPSON (CHARLES SCRIBNER'S SONS: $22.50; 320 PP.)      By Robert L. Jackson, Jackson is an investigative reporter in The Times  Washington Bureau who covered the Wedtech scandal.      John Mariotta, the Puerto Rican immigrant businessman who founded the now  notorious Wedtech Corp. of the South Bronx, was consumed with a desire to make  it big -- for himself, for his family, for his employees and for his country.    So much so, we are told, that the trappings of success became almost more  important to him than the bottom-line corporate figures of his fledgling  defense-contracting enterprise: big limos to take him and his fellow executives  to meetings; dinners at expensive restaurants.    But it seemed Mariotta never knew where to stop. As with many aspects of  Wedtech, the money spent on furnishings alone was beyond all bounds of  propriety. Flushed with his initial success at winning some Army and Navy  contracts, Mariotta turned the executive suite of his former machine shop in  the downtrodden Bronx into a palace worthy of the last days of the  Austro-Hungarian Empire. He bought miles of heavily brocaded silk to cover the  ceiling-high windows of his office, adding Persian carpets and antique  breakfronts. A chandelier fit for a grand ballroom hung in the plant's small  entrance foyer.    The almost bigger-than-life story of how the founders of this ""house of fraud""  corrupted congressmen, lawyers, officials of the Small Business Administration,  former White House aides and New York state officeholders is told in an  entertaining fashion by free-lance writer James Traub, who pored over thousands  of pages of court records and interviewed many of the defendants and federal  prosecutors. The influence-buying scandal broke in late 1986 and eventually  resulted in about two dozen convictions for bribery, conspiracy, fraud and  racketeering. It wound down last year with the convictions of San Francisco  lawyer-lobbyist E. Robert Wallach, a longtime friend of former Attorney General  Edwin Meese III, and New York Congressman Robert Garcia, the second of two  congressmen to fall.    ""Too Good to Be True,"" James Traub's well-organized narrative, laced with humor  and replete with anecdotes, captures the human side of all the malefactors who  peopled this major domestic scandal of the Ronald Reagan years. (The other big  case would be HUD, and the foreign-affairs scandal, of course, was Iran-Contra,  which Traub notes ironically broke about the same time.)    By way of explaining his book's title, Traub shows us that what gave Wedtech  its initial entree to the Reagan Administration was the makeup of the firm.  Originally known as Welbilt Electronic Die Corp., its founder, Mariotta, was an  energetic Latino, and a Republican to boot, at a time when Reaganites wanted to  woo Latino voters and to encourage the principles of private enterprise instead  of government handouts, particularly in an area such as the economically  ravaged South Bronx. Invited to attend a White House meeting of small  businessmen, Mariotta and his company soon became what Traub has labeled ""the  White House poster child.""    But folks who at first promoted the firm for free in the inner circles of  government -- folks like Wallach, Meese's friend, and Reagan political director  Lyn Nofziger -- ultimately latched onto high fees from Wedtech in return for  their lobbying work. Nofziger, of course, waited until after he had left the  White House.    Such importuning by paid friends of Wedtech (it changed its name in going  public in 1983) helped win for it a no-bid $30 million minority-enterprise  contract to produce Army engines and other government work, including a Navy  portable-bridge contract that eventually would have been worth $400 million if  Wedtech had performed well.    But the company's reach exceeded its grasp; high living by its executives,  payoffs to congressmen and state officials and excessively high fees paid to  lawyers and political consultants in return for their influence drained the  small company. All that, combined with poor management and shoddy workmanship,  brought Wedtech to eventual bankruptcy. The dream vanished when its several  hundred workers, mostly blacks and Latinos, lost their jobs as Mariotta and his  colleagues, along with public officials, went off to jail.    Traub suggests we may look upon Wedtech as sort of a morality play that  includes the cynical bribe-payers -- the top officers of the firm -- and  recipients who surrounded the company like flies around a honey pot. But the  play, he suggests, is neither straightforward nor satisfying. It has to do with  deceit and self-delusion, that faculty which permits men to believe what is  useful for them to believe. Mariotta and his executives believed they were only  doing on a smaller scale what large defense contractors accomplish with their  campaign contributions and their employment of top officials who retire from  the Pentagon.    Traub's painstaking account of the rise and fall of Wedtech is at its best in  using the Wedtech case to illustrate how the Washington influence game works;  at its worst when it is burdening us with minute details about too many bit  players in the military-contracts and lobbying field. Yet, even without an  index, which would greatly assist serious scholars of this scandal, Traub's  book organizes a complex and often confusing array of criminal charges into a  sprightly narrative of novel proportions.    Where in American literature, for example, is there a more rapacious figure  than Mario Biaggi, the corrupt New York congressman, who -- unhappy with the  prospect of straightforward payoffs -- demands a piece of Wedtech itself and 5%  of every government contract he can swing its way? Or where a more tragic  figure than lawyer Bob Wallach, a longtime liberal identified with human-rights  and civil-rights causes in San Francisco, who receives a stiff six-year prison  sentence for allegedly receiving illicit payments from Wedtech to lobby Meese  and work for a cause he probably deemed just?    Marilyn Thompson's ""Feeding the Beast"" is a more detailed book on the  characters who people the Wedtech story. An investigative journalist who came  to know them first-hand, Thompson began investigating the scandal for the New  York Daily News in 1986, and her award-winning articles helped bring the case  to national attention.    While Traub relies largely on legal documents and the official transcript of  the Wedtech criminal trials to tell his story, Thompson bases her book heavily  on interviews with federal prosecutors, defense lawyers and many of the  principals themselves. It results in a somewhat slower-paced but richer telling  of the Wedtech story.    Thompson is at her best when she is describing the background and character  traits of the Wedtech malefactors. Describing founder Mariotta as a masterful  manipulator ""who could convince a host of government agencies that his two-bit  machine shop deserved better than the small contracts on which it had  subsisted,"" Thompson reveals that the up-by-the-bootstraps Puerto Rican  struggled with an inferiority complex traceable in part to the fact that he was  illiterate until adulthood. His co-founder, Fred Neuberger, was a Romanian-born  Jew who escaped the Holocaust, became an Israeli ""freedom fighter,"" was known  for his hot temper and once plotted to murder Mariotta because of a policy  dispute, Thompson tells us.

THOMPSON (CHARLES SCRIBNER'S SONS: $22.50; 320 PP.)      By Robert L. Jackson, Jackson is an investigative reporter in The Times  Washington Bureau who covered the Wedtech scandal.      John Mariotta, the Puerto Rican immigrant businessman who founded the now  notorious Wedtech Corp. of the South Bronx, was consumed with a desire to make  it big -- for himself, for his family, for his employees and for his country.    So much so, we are told, that the trappings of success became almost more  important to him than the bottom-line corporate figures of his fledgling  defense-contracting enterprise: big limos to take him and his fellow executives  to meetings; dinners at expensive restaurants.    But it seemed Mariotta never knew where to stop. As with many aspects of  Wedtech, the money spent on furnishings alone was beyond all bounds of  propriety. Flushed with his initial success at winning some Army and Navy  contracts, Mariotta turned the executive suite of his former machine shop in  the downtrodden Bronx into a palace worthy of the last days of the  Austro-Hungarian Empire. He bought miles of heavily brocaded silk to cover the  ceiling-high windows of his office, adding Persian carpets and antique  breakfronts. A chandelier fit for a grand ballroom hung in the plant's small  entrance foyer.    The almost bigger-than-life story of how the founders of this ""house of fraud""  corrupted congressmen, lawyers, officials of the Small Business Administration,  former White House aides and New York state officeholders is told in an  entertaining fashion by free-lance writer James Traub, who pored over thousands  of pages of court records and interviewed many of the defendants and federal  prosecutors. The influence-buying scandal broke in late 1986 and eventually  resulted in about two dozen convictions for bribery, conspiracy, fraud and  racketeering. It wound down last year with the convictions of San Francisco  lawyer-lobbyist E. Robert Wallach, a longtime friend of former Attorney General  Edwin Meese III, and New York Congressman Robert Garcia, the second of two  congressmen to fall.    ""Too Good to Be True,"" James Traub's well-organized narrative, laced with humor  and replete with anecdotes, captures the human side of all the malefactors who  peopled this major domestic scandal of the Ronald Reagan years. (The other big  case would be HUD, and the foreign-affairs scandal, of course, was Iran-Contra,  which Traub notes ironically broke about the same time.)    By way of explaining his book's title, Traub shows us that what gave Wedtech  its initial entree to the Reagan Administration was the makeup of the firm.  Originally known as Welbilt Electronic Die Corp., its founder, Mariotta, was an  energetic Latino, and a Republican to boot, at a time when Reaganites wanted to  woo Latino voters and to encourage the principles of private enterprise instead  of government handouts, particularly in an area such as the economically  ravaged South Bronx. Invited to attend a White House meeting of small  businessmen, Mariotta and his company soon became what Traub has labeled ""the  White House poster child.""    But folks who at first promoted the firm for free in the inner circles of  government -- folks like Wallach, Meese's friend, and Reagan political director  Lyn Nofziger -- ultimately latched onto high fees from Wedtech in return for  their lobbying work. Nofziger, of course, waited until after he had left the  White House.    Such importuning by paid friends of Wedtech (it changed its name in going  public in 1983) helped win for it a no-bid $30 million minority-enterprise  contract to produce Army engines and other government work, including a Navy  portable-bridge contract that eventually would have been worth $400 million if  Wedtech had performed well.    But the company's reach exceeded its grasp; high living by its executives,  payoffs to congressmen and state officials and excessively high fees paid to  lawyers and political consultants in return for their influence drained the  small company. All that, combined with poor management and shoddy workmanship,  brought Wedtech to eventual bankruptcy. The dream vanished when its several  hundred workers, mostly blacks and Latinos, lost their jobs as Mariotta and his  colleagues, along with public officials, went off to jail.    Traub suggests we may look upon Wedtech as sort of a morality play that  includes the cynical bribe-payers -- the top officers of the firm -- and  recipients who surrounded the company like flies around a honey pot. But the  play, he suggests, is neither straightforward nor satisfying. It has to do with  deceit and self-delusion, that faculty which permits men to believe what is  useful for them to believe. Mariotta and his executives believed they were only  doing on a smaller scale what large defense contractors accomplish with their  campaign contributions and their employment of top officials who retire from  the Pentagon.    Traub's painstaking account of the rise and fall of Wedtech is at its best in  using the Wedtech case to illustrate how the Washington influence game works;  at its worst when it is burdening us with minute details about too many bit  players in the military-contracts and lobbying field. Yet, even without an  index, which would greatly assist serious scholars of this scandal, Traub's  book organizes a complex and often confusing array of criminal charges into a  sprightly narrative of novel proportions.    Where in American literature, for example, is there a more rapacious figure  than Mario Biaggi, the corrupt New York congressman, who -- unhappy with the  prospect of straightforward payoffs -- demands a piece of Wedtech itself and 5%  of every government contract he can swing its way? Or where a more tragic  figure than lawyer Bob Wallach, a longtime liberal identified with human-rights  and civil-rights causes in San Francisco, who receives a stiff six-year prison  sentence for allegedly receiving illicit payments from Wedtech to lobby Meese  and work for a cause he probably deemed just?    Marilyn Thompson's ""Feeding the Beast"" is a more detailed book on the  characters who people the Wedtech story. An investigative journalist who came  to know them first-hand, Thompson began investigating the scandal for the New  York Daily News in 1986, and her award-winning articles helped bring the case  to national attention.    While Traub relies largely on legal documents and the official transcript of  the Wedtech criminal trials to tell his story, Thompson bases her book heavily  on interviews with federal prosecutors, defense lawyers and many of the  principals themselves. It results in a somewhat slower-paced but richer telling  of the Wedtech story.    Thompson is at her best when she is describing the background and character  traits of the Wedtech malefactors. Describing founder Mariotta as a masterful  manipulator ""who could convince a host of government agencies that his two-bit  machine shop deserved better than the small contracts on which it had  subsisted,"" Thompson reveals that the up-by-the-bootstraps Puerto Rican  struggled with an inferiority complex traceable in part to the fact that he was  illiterate until adulthood. His co-founder, Fred Neuberger, was a Romanian-born  Jew who escaped the Holocaust, became an Israeli ""freedom fighter,"" was known  for his hot temper and once plotted to murder Mariotta because of a policy  dispute, Thompson tells us.    Despite her closeness to the case, Thompson tells her story as a straight  reporter without interpretation. One wishes she had drawn more lessons from  Wedtech, much as Traub does.

Mr Justice CF 'Frikkie' Eloff found Mr Derby-Lewis's wife Gaye not guilty on all counts. The three were charged with murdering Mr Hani, conspiring to murder him and eight others, and illegal possession of a firearm. The eight included Mr Nelson Mandela, president of the African National Congress, Mr Joe Slovo, chairman of the South African Communist party, Judge Richard Goldstone, who heads an investigation into political violence, Mr Ken Owen, editor of the Sunday Times, and Mr Pik Botha, the foreign minister. A large crowd gathered outside the court dancing, waving placards and chanting the controversial slogan 'Kill the Boer, Kill the farmer'. The death of Mr Hani - found by an opinion poll earlier this year to be the most popular South African after Mr Mandela - brought the country to a virtual standstill for 10 days as politicians and police struggled to control the anger of his supporters.

Union members object to  discrepancies between their salaries and those paid to soldiers  in the National Peacekeeping Force (NPKF). SAPU leaders are  ""under pressure to agree to a strike on April 13 if no remedial  action is taken. The argument of militant members is powerful:  SAPU memoranda submitted to President de Klerk and the  Transitional Executive Council have been shelved, but when the  NPKF recruits went on strike their demands for more pay were  speedily met."" THE STAR believes a strike by SAPU members can  only ""compound the crisis"" in police ranks. The NPKF is a  ""small and untested military unit"" and ""a heavy burden of  protecting the electoral process already falls on the  overstretched SADF [South African Defense Force]. If that  burden is increased by a strike in police ranks, the election  itself may be imperiled, particularly if there is renewed  violence outside kwaZulu/Natal.""    Article Warns of `Undemocratic' Guarantees for Zulu Kingdom  -- Hugh Roberton writes in an article on the same page that what  Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi and Zulu  King Zwelithini are demanding ""in essence are guarantees of the  survival, and future status, of the Zulu king and his kingdom.  The only way which De Klerk and Mandela can do this is by way  of constitutional guarantees which do not now exist."" For the  sake of what would be a ""precarious peace at best, are De Klerk  and Mandela prepared to promise to guarantee the king's right,  for instance, to have a say in the appointment of some of the  regional kwaZulu/Natal cabinet?"" Roberton believes that ""while  a degree of constitutional flexibility is needed in South Africa  to satisfy the `special circumstances' that might exist in a  region, such flexibility surely should not extend to granting  individuals, or groups, powers which they do not now have and  which they have not had for almost a century. Such a profoundly  undemocratic dispensing of power in the case of kwaZulu would  amount to entrenching a 19th century tribal fiefdom into the  constitution of a country standing at the doorway of the 21st  century.""

However, SOWETAN is sure there  are ""various proposals that can be made to satisfy both Zulu  leaders. In any case, isolating Buthelezi will not solve the  problem: he is a key factor in the politics of kwaZulu-Natal.  It is now evident that the Afrikaner Volksfront [National Front  -- AVF] is prepared to enter the race, which makes a solution in  Natal even more vital. The state of emergency cannot be lifted  immediately even if it were an almost panic-driven move to quell  the violence.""    WEEKLY MAIL  GUARDIAN    Emergency Not Enforced in Natal -- Johannesburg WEEKLY MAIL    GUARDIAN in English for 8-14 April in its page-14 editorial says  the emergency regulations imposed in Natal were ""horribly like  the emergency regulations of the 1980s, and would fall foul of  the Bill of Rights the government and the ANC purport to  support."" The security force members have ""blanket immunity""  and the detainees receive ""so little protection."" However,  having ""given themselves these powers, the authorities then fail  to use them in any significant way."" Among other things the  soldiers form a ""scanty presence in the urban areas,"" and the  police ""find themselves unable to disarm marchers in Empangeni  who are blatantly breaking the ban on dangerous weapons."" ""It  would have been better to use existing, normal law and order  powers -- of which the authorities have plenty -- to deal with  the problem, rather than a showy emergency that is not enforced.""

An immediate effect was that they have been  given a welcome respite from an opposition move to call for a  no-confidence debate over the unimpressive performance of the  administration.    As the mystery shrouding the past deeds of Chat Thai MP  Thanong Siriprichaphong is being unraveled with more  embarrassing evidence involving his alleged role in marijuana  consignments to the U.S., Thai authorities appear reluctant to  be put on the spot with the lawmaker. A nagging question from  the public is ""why so?""    Thanong, proprietor of the Little Duck Group of hotel and  entertainment chains, has become an ugly duckling for Chat Thai  Party and the whole opposition block which have been dismayed by  a sudden reversal of fortune. Newly-elected Chat Thai leader  Banhan Sinlapa-acha must have been particularly upset by the  jinx which had further dimmed his chances of being in the  government by whatever means he deems possible.    The scandal has made all senior officials in law enforcement  and drug suppression look very foolish. First they said they  had not been aware of Thanong's path to his current vast  fortune. Yielding to more pressing questions, they conceded  that they had quite substantial information about the MP's  alleged role in drug trafficking.    The public is frustrated on many points after hearing hasty  explanations from Thanong as well as government authorities.  Thanong categorically denied on May 6 that he had no idea about  the assets seized by U.S. authorities, but conceded on Tuesday  that he had indeed owned the property and a limousine in  California. The exposed falsehood was sufficient to wash away  whatever innocence he had claimed.    Any prosecutor having Thanong on the defense stand and with  that kind of admission would certainly be rubbing his hands in  glee. But wait a minute. What we heard later from government  officials was perplexing. From all comments, it boiled down to  something like this: they weren't quite sure whether legal  actions could be taken against the lawmaker who is being accused  by U.S. authorities of trafficking in narcotics.    ""There is not yet any evidence to implicate him,"" they said.  This is really funny. They made the statement even before there  was any attempt to start an investigation. The Police  Department is silent. The Interior Ministry officials are  distancing themselves from the ""sitting duck"" who is now in the  line of fire of U.S. legal potshots.    The Narcotics Suppression Unit has not displayed any  enthusiasm to launch a probe, despite a forced admission that  there was substantial record of suspected illegal activities.  The Office of the Attorney General did not seem interested in  finding out whether there are grounds for legal actions.    We wonder why, because the whole mess is making a mockery of  our creaking legal machinery.    But more revealing yesterday was an explanation from  American  authorities that there had been a plan to arrest the MP if he  showed up in the United States. This should be dreadful enough  for Thanong to change his bravado that he intended to prove his  innocence in any U.S. court of law. He will be lucky enough,  from now on, to stay away from the long arm of the American law  whenever he travels outside Thailand.    There are too many fine points involved. But there are  things to be done. Thanong must discontinue his House  membership to reduce the negative image on the institution. The  government must start investigations right away on this  explosive scandal. If not, it must explain to the public why  the MP should be exempted from due process of the law to clear  his name.    If the government is unmoved, it would not be a surprise to  see Chat Thai and other opposition MPs from Chat Phathana and  Social Action parties come up soon with an audacious demand that  Prime Minister Chuan resign to show his responsibility, if  Thanong refuses to quit.    Knowing full well the extent of their political scruples, we  believe that they certainly can go that far.     "

Transvaal IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] leader Themba  Khosa says his organization will also oppose the planned  replacement of the controversial ISU with SADF [South African  Defense Force] units. He was reacting to a statement by the Law  and Order Ministr?}he 'overnment is considering red ucing ISU  members on`? Ra6d because of the continued instability in the  region. The ministry said it's possible that the ISU could be  replaced by soldiers.    The announcement is thought to arise from Tuesday's meeting  between Nelson Mandela and President F.W. de Klerk. The ANC  [African National Congress] leader went to that meeting with a  number of proposals to end violence. Khosa says the IFP has  made 7Hcomplaints about soldiers killing 10 of its members in  December last year and 3,000 ?ere fired at civilians in a single  incident. The IFP leader says it's well known that th?e causing  problems in Katlehong are mem bers of the ANC's armed wing and  its self-defense units.     "

Would that it were so simple] Most independent estimates suggest that a minimum wage of half male median earnings will cost at least 100,000 jobs. Young people and women in service industries will bear the brunt of the job losses. As for bringing Britain into line with Europe, a glance at youth unemployment rates in those European countries with minimum wages is instructive. UK youth unemployment in 1988, the latest year of complete OECD figures, was 11.8 per cent compared to 21.7 per cent in France, 34.5 per cent in Italy and 40 per cent in Spain. Of course, the aim may be convergence.  The Financial Times   London Page 11  "

By IRV LETOFSKY, TIMES STAFF WRITER      Using terms like ""distorted fiction"" and accusing the filmmakers of having ""an  agenda"" to make the church look bad, Roman Catholic officials and observers are  taking sharp exception to a new HBO movie based on a 1980s sex scandal in a  Louisiana diocese involving a priest and dozens of boys.    The movie, ""Judgment,"" premiering tonight at 9, focuses less on the  molestations and more on the attempts of the bishop and his vicar general to  cover it up.    The scenario revolves around a family (the Guitrys, played by Blythe Danner and  Keith Carradine, with Michael Faustino as the son) and their flamboyant  attorney (Jack Warden), who battle the entrenched power of the diocese.    Although names are changed and events juggled, the plot closely follows a case  that caused a sensation when it surfaced in 1984 at the Lafayette diocese deep  in Cajun country. Father Gilbert Gauthe admitted molesting 37 children,  including altar boys and parish Boy Scouts, and was given 20 years in prison  without benefit of parole.    Although Gauthe attracted the most celebrity, seven priests eventually were  removed and the diocese and insurers reportedly paid families more than $22  million in settlements. The family on which the movie family was patterned won  $1,025,000.    The revelations were the first pedophilia case of such scope to scandalize the  church. There have been many others reported since. Jason Berry, a prominent  investigative reporter in New Orleans who specializes on Catholic affairs and  is completing a book on pedophilia and homosexuality in the church, estimates  that the church has paid between $100 million and $300 million in 100 child  sexual settlements in the last six years.    In the movie, the Guitrys join other families seeking financial settlements  from the church, but insurance lawyers insist that the church not give the  families spiritual solace, on grounds that that would constitute an admission  of liability and damages would be costlier. The Guitrys are very devout but  grow furious that the bishop and his staff had known about the abuse but kept  giving the offending priest new assignments within the parish. They break from  the group and hire an attorney. Then the case becomes public.    Asked to comment on ""Judgment,"" Msgr. Alexander Sigur, new vicar general of the  Lafayette diocese portrayed in the movie, referred The Times to a written  statement that he made to written questions from Sister Mary Ann Walsh, media  editor of the Catholic News Service. She had supplied him with a copy of the  film.    ""Only a part of the film,"" Sigur responded, ""is based on fact and the balance  is distorted fiction. . . . The portrayal of the church's reaction to that  priest's conduct is totally distorted.""    The truth, he said, is that ""immediately"" upon receiving notice that the priest  was accused of committing these pedophilic acts, he was removed and ""criminal  proceedings were instituted."" He also disputed how the movie ""fictitiously  depicts"" the church as ""callous"" about the victims.    Getting a movie made on the events at the parish was problematic. Executive  producer Steve Tisch (""The Burning Bed,"" ""Risky Business"") said that he and  producers Ron Hershman and Dan Wigutow pitched the idea to CBS and NBC and were  turned down. ABC, however, declaring itself not turned off by the controversial  theme, ordered a script, Tisch said.    But later, Tisch said, when he asked for some assurance that ""top management of  Capital Cities,"" which owns ABC, would fully support the project, ""a top  network executive . . . took it to a top Cap Cities executive -- who said that  it (the movie) is not going to happen at ABC.""    An ABC spokesman said that the project was dropped because the network had done  two other molestation movies (""Deadly Silence"" and ""Unspeakable Acts"") and that  ""it did not go up the corporate ladder,"" as Tisch described.    Hershman, who previously produced a segment on the Louisiana parish scandal for  the CBS news magazine ""West 57th,"" and Wigutow then met with HBO and got a  go-ahead when Tom Topor agreed to write and direct. Topor had written the  Broadway play and screenplay for ""Nuts,"" which has an incest theme, and ""The  Accused,"" about a gang rape.    First-time director Topor has only seen an early ""rough cut"" of the film  because, he related, he was fired late in the production after battles with his  producers and was replaced by veteran director David Greene (""Roots,"" ""Fatal  Vision""). But he stands by what he saw that far, he said.    Relevant sources who were asked to pre-screen videocassettes of ""Judgment"" had  many criticisms -- erroneous church liturgy, faulty legal references, a mixing  of time frames.    A longtime New York City news reporter, Topor agreed that some people might  find distortions in the movie and said that he did make ""certain  extrapolations"": ""The question is whether I distorted its emotional essence or  its narrative essence, and I don't believe I did.""    J. Minos Simon, the attorney portrayed by Warden, thought the portrayals were  ""excellent,"" but maintained that the filmmakers were ""generous"" with the  bishop.    ""His agony was not over wanting to tell,"" he said. ""His agony was over the fact  that the secrecy lid was lifted and he was exposed for the first time."" He  contended that the bishop knew about Gauthe's ""proclivities"" but kept  transferring him within the diocese ""to a fresh new lot of victims.""    Simon had an informant -- not a priest and not one who was blackmailed into  helping, as shown in the movie -- who discovered diocese files which revealed  that at least 24 priests, about one-fourth of the priest population in the  diocese, were homosexual. This information, falling into Simon's hands,  ""jarred"" the diocese and forced it to admit liability, Simon said.    Veteran reviewer Henry Herx of the Catholic News Service complained that the  film makes no attempt at balance in treatment of the clergy, ""not even one good  priest."" He commended the filmmakers for focusing on the ""agonized family  rather than the sexual crimes of the clergyman.""    The candor of the film won't offend Catholics, but they're likely to be ""much  more sensitive"" to the treatment of the church as an uncaring bureaucracy, he  said.    Father Gregory Coiro, a public affairs official in the Archdiocese of Los  Angeles, found the movie priests ""stereotypical and unrealistic."" He said that  while the subject should not be covered up, ""I really feel that the people who  made this movie had an agenda, and I'm sorry to say but I think their agenda  was to make the church look bad.""    He said that the priesthood has its failures ""as in any other profession.

The waste stems from chemicals, paint  residues, and other dangerous substances from a closed-down  plant of the former GDR. After news of the illegal transport  had been received, the approximate 200 tonnes of waste were  placed in temporary storage in Hungary. It was said in Budapest  that those responsible for the toxic waste scandal cannot be  made answerable for it, because the relevant legislation  contains loopholes and the persons responsible have disappeared.  The toxic waste, which Germany is getting back ""after long  talks,"" is to be handed over at the Austro-German border.  Storage and transport costs amount to about 170,000 marks.    In 1993, Lower Saxony exported almost half its toxic waste  to  other German laender and abroad. Altogether, some 417,562  tonnes of special waste were disposed of, said Schulze-Rickmann,  the general manager of the Lower Saxon Company for the Disposal  of Special Waste, yesterday. In addition, there were several  hundred thousand tonnes of toxic waste that were disposed of by  producers internally.     "

All the evidence suggests it was her gender, rather than her race, which was the determining factor in her appeal to voters; at present the Senate boasts only two women members of any race. Her Republican opponent, Mr Rich Williamson, had struggled in vain against anonymity and remained almost totally unknown to voters right up to polling day. Ms Braun, by contrast, spent much of the campaign posing for the covers of glossy magazines, helped by a magnetic smile and a warm personality. She ran into trouble in the final weeks of the campaign because of reports that she had committed financial irregularities to ensure that her mother continued to qualify for Medicaid, which provides medical care for the poor. But sceptics' forecasts that this scandal would allow latent racism to come into play, and frustrate her bid for the seat, proved to be unfounded.  The Financial Times   London Page 7  "

It was June 25, 1984, and  President Ronald Reagan and his advisers were arguing heatedly over how to get  aid to Nicaragua's Contras.    ""Jim Baker (then White House chief of staff) said that if we go out and try to  get money from third countries, it is an impeachable offense,"" warned Secretary  of State George P. Shultz.    ""I am entitled to complete the record,"" CIA Director William J. Casey shot  back. "" . . . Once he learned that the finding (a presidential order on aiding  the Contras) does encourage cooperation from third countries, Jim Baker  immediately dropped his view that this could be an impeachable offense -- and  you heard him say that, George.""      Cautions on Reciprocity    ""How can anyone object to the United States encouraging third parties to  provide help to the anti-Sandinistas?"" asked Vice President George Bush. ""The  only problem that might come up is if the United States were to promise to give  these third parties something in return so that some people could interpret  this as some kind of an exchange.""    ""I certainly hope none of this discussion will be made public in any way,"" said  National Security Adviser Robert C. McFarlane.    At that point, President Ronald Reagan spoke up. ""If such a story gets out,"" he  said, ""we'll all be hanging by our thumbs in front of the White House until we  find out who did it"" -- apparently a warning to anyone who might be tempted to  leak the information.    But the story is out now -- an unexpected byproduct of the trial of former  White House aide Oliver L. North.    As part of his defense against charges that he lied to Congress, shredded  documents and misused government funds, North's lawyers forced the government  to provide hundreds of pages of once-secret records as evidence -- a stack  about four inches high.    And despite more than two years of earlier investigations of the Iran-Contra  scandal, by both Congress and a White House commission, the newly released  documents have added significantly to what already was known about the long and  tangled affair.    They disclose that Reagan approved a scheme to send new aid to Honduras as what  McFarlane called a ""quid pro quo"" for that country's aid to the Contras.    They show that President Bush, who has long insisted that he knew almost  nothing about the secret effort to aid the Contras, was aware of that action --  and personally encouraged Honduras to continue its support for the rebels.    They have reopened the historical debate over the nature of Reagan's  presidency: was he a detached chief executive, unaware of what his underlings  were doing, as the presidential commission headed by former Sen. John Tower  (R-Tex.) concluded in 1987? Or was he the secret mastermind of the Iran-Contra  affair, far more active and engaged than most accounts have portrayed him?      Withheld Documents at Issue    Finally, they have raised new questions about whether the White House withheld  documents from the congressional committees investigating the scandal, despite  Reagan's promises to cooperate fully. Both Senate Majority Leader George J.  Mitchell (D-Me.) and Rep. Lee H. Hamilton (D-Ind.), chairman of the House  Iran-Contra Committee, have said that the trial turned up significant documents  that their panels never saw, and Congress' two intelligence committees have  launched investigations of the issue.    The most immediate effect of the new disclosures may be to erode Bush's  credibility, one of the President's greatest assets in his first months in  office. Last week, The Times Poll found that 51% of the public believes that  Bush has lied about the Iran-Contra events. About 35% said that the trial has  made them believe that Bush was more deeply involved in the scandal than they  had realized; 16% said that they now think he was less involved.    And 67% of the public believes that North was only following orders and is  taking the blame for Iran-Contra to protect both Bush and former President  Reagan, the poll found.      Insisted He Knew Little    During the 1987 investigations of the scandal and his 1988 presidential  campaign, Bush insisted that he knew little or nothing about the secret effort  to fund the Contras during the period when Congress prohibited U.S. aid to the  rebels.    But the documents indicate that Bush was well-informed about the Reagan  Administration's efforts to persuade Honduras and other countries to support  the rebels. And when Reagan signed a 1985 directive authorizing accelerated  economic and military aid for Honduras as ""incentives for them to persist in  aiding the freedom fighters,"" Bush was sent a copy of the order.    Shortly after that directive was signed, Bush visited Honduras and met with the  country's president, Roberto Suazo Cordova. Officials who were present said  that Bush discussed Honduras' aid to the Contras, but he did not describe it as  a quid pro quo for U.S. aid.    ""There was no quid pro quo (in the meeting with Suazo),"" Bush told reporters  Thursday. ""Everybody that attended the meeting says that there was no quid pro  quo."" But he did not address the larger issue of whether he knew about or  approved the deal with Honduras.      See Spirit of Law Violated    The documents show that North and others at the National Security Council  understood that they were violating the spirit of the law by engineering Contra  aid from other countries. ""Notwithstanding our own interpretations, it is very  clear . . . that the legislative intent was to deny any direct or indirect  support for military/paramilitary operations in Nicaragua,"" North wrote in a  memorandum to McFarlane.    And they show that while President Reagan may have been detached from the  details of his policies, he was fully informed of the efforts to aid the  Contras -- and personally approved actions to carry out the plan.    Reagan signed several directives authorizing aid to Honduras in exchange for  that country's help for the Contras, personally telephoned Honduran President  Suazo to ask his help and approved a North plan to airdrop recoilless rifles to  the Contras so they could attempt to sink a ship carrying arms to Nicaragua,  the documents show.    When the scandal first erupted, Reagan denied knowing anything about the NSC  efforts to aid the Contras. He later changed his story and said that seeking  foreign aid had been ""my idea to begin with.""      Role Unclear on Arms Profits    However, the trial has not shed any new light on whether Reagan knew of North's  action in skimming profits for the Contras from the secret sale of arms to  Iran. North testified -- as he did before Congress in 1987 -- that he did not  know whether Reagan had authorized that scheme. Reagan has repeatedly denied  any knowledge of the diversion.    ""At each stage of the process in which more information has been made  available, President Reagan's involvement becomes clearer and more deep,"" Sen.  Mitchell said last week.    Asked whether Congress might reopen the Iran-Contra affair and investigate the  actions of Reagan and Bush again, Mitchell said that seemed unlikely.

BUT THE SOCIALISTS MAKE GAINS.      By SAM JAMESON, TIMES STAFF WRITER      TOKYO      Recovering from a humiliating defeat only last July, Japan's ruling Liberal  Democratic Party overcame a record surge by the Socialists to win a decisive  victory in a crucial House of Representatives election, final returns showed  today.    Liberal Democrats and other ""unaffiliated"" conservatives expected to join or  vote with the governing party had won 289 seats, a majority of 33 in the  512-seat lower house, the chamber that chooses the prime minister.    A large turnout of 73.3% of the nation's 90.6 million eligible voters cast  ballots in clear, unseasonably warm weather Sunday.    After just four hours of tabulations, NHK, the quasi-governmental national  radio and TV network, declared that Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu's party was  assured of winning a majority.    The No. 1 opposition party, the Socialists, who advocate unarmed neutrality,  added a record 55 seats to bolster their position in the lower chamber to 141  seats, including ""unaffiliated"" winners expected to vote with them. Their  biggest previous gain -- 27 seats -- came in 1972.    Not since 1967 have the Socialists won as many as 141 seats in the lower house.  Four years ago, they won only 86, a historic low.    But losses among three other opposition parties enabled Kaifu's party to extend  its 35-year control of the lower house.    The results were surprising, coming as they did on the trail of political  problems that had resulted in the unprecedented loss of the LDP's majority in  the upper house of Parliament in elections last July. These problems included a  taxation controversy, accusations that many ruling party stalwarts were guilty  of playing ""money politics"" and widespread dissatisfaction within Japan's  important farming sector.    Even without such problems, the Liberal Democrats could not have realistically  expected a victory larger than the one they achieved, in the view of veteran  observers. Japanese voters traditionally have swayed away from the Liberal  Democrats after each major lower house victory scored by the ruling party.    In the last lower house election in 1986, the Liberal Democrats wound up with  310 seats after embracing other conservative winners.    The victory bolstered the fragile position of Kaifu, who was plucked from  obscurity last August after an influence-buying scandal smeared all mainstream  party leaders. He promised to use Sunday's victory to carry out political  reform.    Despite her party's gains, Takako Doi, the Socialists' charismatic chairwoman,  said that the failure to unseat the Liberal Democrats was ""very unfortunate.""    Ichiro Ozawa, the Liberal Democrats' secretary general, said opposition parties  had failed to come up with any clear policy for a Socialist-led coalition.  Voters, he added, decided they could not turn the government over to such an  uncertain future.    Voters supported Liberal Democrats' ""policy formed with eyes on the ground,""  Kaifu said. ""Reverse winds"" blowing against the party have changed  considerably, he added.    The turnaround in Liberal Democratic fortunes, however, did nothing to clear up  the foggy political situation created by the party's loss last July of its  majority in the House of Councilors.    Ozawa declared that the party would use its majority in the lower house to  reelect Kaifu as prime minister without attempting to form a coalition. But he  also stressed the need for the governing party to discuss parliamentary deals  with opposition parties in light of the conservatives' minority position in the  House of Councilors.    All legislation, except for the budget and international treaties, must be  approved by the upper house as well as by the House of Representatives.    Masashi Yamakawa, director of Nikko Securities' Osaka stock division, said the  election result ""cleared a big hurdle"" but added that stockbrokers ""can't  welcome the news with open hands"" Because of expectations that the Central Bank  would carry out its fourth increase since last May 31 in the central discount  rate it charges for loans to commercial institutions. The rate is now 4.25%.    The yen finished morning trading at 144.45 to the dollar on the Tokyo Foreign  Exchange Market, up 0.10 from Friday's close. Because of a fear of higher  interest rates, stocks, however, fell 217.90 points to 37,242.42 in morning  trading.    At the beginning of the campaign, pollsters had predicted that the Liberal  Democrats would win only a narrow victory. But voters -- as they did in 1980,  when the perennial ruling party also faced the threat of defeat going into a  lower house election -- returned to the fold, apparently out of fear of a  Socialist-led coalition.    The Liberal Democratic Party and the conservative forces that preceded it in  office have governed Japan without interruption since 1948.    Farmers, whose revolt against the conservatives' moves to open markets to  agricultural imports devastated the ruling party last July, displayed only a  small measure of discontent this time.    In the rice-rich Tohoku (Northeast) area and on the mikan (mandarin orange)  island of Shikoku, conservatives lost 11 of the 56 seats they won four years  ago. The showing, however, was a sharp gain from last July, when Liberal  Democratic candidates were wiped out in both agricultural regions.    The anger of women voters, who rebelled last year against a controversial 3%  consumption tax implemented by the Liberal Democrats, appeared to play a  smaller role in the results than was the case in July. Although 74.6% of women  voters -- 2.7% more than the male turnout -- cast ballots, 12 out of 66 women  candidates -- five more than in 1986 -- were elected.    Last July, 22 women won seats in the upper chamber, the highest ever.    Except for one newcomer, all candidates tainted in the Recruit Co.  influence-buying scandal that forced former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita to  resign last June won reelection.    Takeshita, who received nearly $1.5 million in contributions and profits from  Recruit Co. stocks, was reelected handily, while former Prime Minister Yasuhiro  Nakasone, who received nearly $800,000, survived the most severe challenge he  has had in 17 elections dating back to 1947. He finished third among four  winners in his Gumma prefecture (state) district.    ""I do not know the words with which to thank you,"" he told supporters after his  victory was confirmed Sunday night.    Opposition forces made a special attempt to unseat Nakasone, who violated no  laws despite the money he received from Recruit Co., an information and real  estate conglomerate. But voters of Gumma prefecture returned three of the four  candidates they have elected every year since 196. The one exception: Yasuo  Fukuda, 53, replaced his father, former Prime Minister Takeo Fukuda, 85, who  retired.    Former Prime Minister Sosuke Uno, who resigned when he was smeared by a sex  scandal in the aftermath of July's debacle, also was reelected.    The Socialists' Doi claimed that voters' desire to abolish the 10-month-old 3%  consumption tax led to a spurt in support for her party. She reiterated her  determination to abolish the tax when a special session of Parliament opens  later this month to choose the prime minister and debate a fiscal 1989  supplementary budget as well as the budget for fiscal 1990.    Election ANALYSIS: Electorate opted for continuity over change. A11      NEXT STEP    Japan's new House of Representatives, still dominated by Liberal Democrats, is  likely to reseat Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu when it convenes next Monday or  Tuesday. Later next week, Japan will resume talks with the United States to  relieve trade tensions. The talks had been put off until after the election.

0,FT932-7074 ,"FT932-7074 _AN-DEZCHAAWFT 930526   FT  26 MAY 93 / Spanish Elections: Enemy of the people-in-power - A Spanish editor becomes bad news for the government      By PETER BRUCE   THE MAN most responsible for forcing Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez of Spain to call a snap general election on June 6, and for the fact that he may lose it, is a journalist, not a politician. Mr Pedro J. Ramirez, an obsessed, nimble-brained self-publicist, has been a thorn in the side of the Socialist government for years. He sees Mr Gonzalez as a silver-tongued constrictor who has wound himself around the great institutions of state and crushed the beginnings of democracy. 'It is irrelevant to me who wins the election as long as it is not Gonzalez,' he says. 'Victory again would make Felipe a dictator.' Mr Ramirez, 41, is the darling of intellectuals who once supported Mr Gonzalez but who have not been able to stomach the grubbiness of government. Democracy should have been full of earnest, incisive debate, close elections and new ideas. It has been none of those things, but Mr Ramirez tirelessly chases his dream of clean politics, and just before the last election, in October 1989, he crafted the weapon he needed. Sacked as editor of the Madrid daily, Diario 16, in March 1989 - for insulting the Socialists - he decided to become his own boss, and in seven months created, staffed and financed his own newspaper, El Mundo. Practically every stone in the mountain of political scandal that has brought Mr Gonzalez so close to defeat has been put there by El Mundo. Opposition parties regularly use its editorials as the starting point for parliamentary initiatives and, in the process, El Mundo has become the third biggest national daily newspaper in the country, after the pro-government El Pais and the right-wing ABC. It claims to sell nearly 250,000 copies a day. Rivals contest this, but last year El Mundo, now with a big Italian shareholder, made its first operating profit. El Mundo's growth, especially among young urban readers, has frightened established titles. Mr Gonzalez and Mr Ramirez were once on good terms, but the editor says Mr Gonzalez failed to keep his promise to open up Spain. Soon after coming to power in 1982 the Socialists began co-opting people and institutions, he says. Spain's constitution encourages this. Socialist parliamentary majorities have given them the majority of votes in the selection of supreme court judges and control of the boards of the public television and radio services. They have changed the way the law works. Once, unpopular new legislation could be challenged and stopped in its tracks until the slow-moving constitutional court ruled. Now, new laws can be be applied until the court says otherwise, thus blunting one of democracy's important checks and balances. To quieten the press the Socialists also want to criminalise defamation. But it was the discovery of GAL, a group attacking sympathisers of the Basque terrorist group Eta in exile in France, that finally made him and the prime minister deadly enemies. At Diario 16 and El Mundo, Mr Ramirez pursued what he assumed was a state-financed dirty war, supported by a crusading judge, Baltasar Garzon. Now Mr Garzon has become a Socialist candidate and Mr Ramirez cannot contain his dismay: 'Its like Robin Hood taking a job with the Sheriff of Nottingham.' Mr Ramirez' obsession has produced some outstanding journalism, documenting, among other things the GAL investigations, the Filesa scandal in which the Socialists appear to have raised funds illicitly from business, and the Guerra affair, where the ex-deputy prime minister's brother ran a business empire from a free government office. Mr Ramirez is happy to admit he is helping the conservative Partido Popular in this election but insists this is only because they are the only opposition capable of winning. He is generous to the Communists, too, because they weaken the Socialists on the left.   Companies:-  El Mundo.   Countries:-  ESZ  Spain, EC.   Industries:-  P9199 General Government, NEC.

African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela, State  President F W de Klerk, Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini and  Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] President Mangosuthu Buthelezi are  to meet at a secret venue in what is widely perceived as a  last-ditch attempt to save the country from a bloody poll in  three weeks' time.    On the eve of the summit, the ANC, through Mr Mandela and  its  Natal region, was adamant there was no chance of an election  postponement. But IFP marchers in Empangeni this week demanded  elections be delayed to allow international mediation to run its  course.    A memorandum presented by the marchers warned the  Independent  Electoral Commission [IEC] it would find it difficult to conduct  peaceful, free and fair elections unless the IFP's  constitutional demands for federalism were met.    This came as violence threatened to engulf the Natal/kwaZulu  region, with scores of townships and rural settlements already  under virtual siege and death tolls climbing at alarming rates.  Despite last Thursday's declaration of a state of emergency,  more than 120 people have been killed in what amounts to an  average daily toll of more than 17 lives.    Although IEC Vice-Chairman Dikgang Moseneke said on Thursday  the commission was forging ahead with preparations for elections  in Natal/kwaZulu, electioneering has become virtually impossible  in many areas of the region.    His view was endorsed by IEC Chairman Mr Justice Johann  Kriegler. Elections would be held in kwaZulu in spite of  political unwillingness, Mr Justice Kriegler said.    At least two voter education workshops have been attacked  and  a National Party MP in northern Natal was forced to flee a mob  while putting up posters last week.    KwaZulu MPs and tribal chiefs have also made it clear to Mr  Justice Kriegler that the IEC is unwelcome in many rural areas  under kwaZulu control.    ANC Southern Natal Chairman Jeff Radebe said the ANC was  hoping Friday's summit would pave the way for free and fair  elections in Natal. ""We'd like the king to indicate to all his  subjects that it is a democratic right for everyone to vote.  The ANC would also like to indicate to His Majesty what we feel  about the future of the Zulu monarchy. We are hoping to dispel  some misconceptions,"" he said.    Mr Radebe said Mr Mandela would meet King Zwelithini  privately at the undisclosed summit venue before the four  leaders meet.    IFP Central Committee member Thembinkosi Memela said his  party remained inflexible on its rejection of the negotiated  interim constitution. ""We will be firm on these issues, and  that is the reason why international mediators have been called  in to settle the constitutional dispute -- because we are firm.""    He said Zulu self-determination and King Zwelithini's  demands  for sovereignty would also be addressed at Friday's talks.    A Durban newspaper on Thursday reported King Zwelithini was  prepared to become ceremonial head of kwaZulu/Natal and drop his  demand for an independent Zulu kingdom if this would help reach  a settlement. Mr Memela, however, said he was unaware of this  development.    Questioned on whether anything concrete was likely to come  out of the summit, Mr Memela said: ""In the light of escalating  violence, everyone is serious about solving these problems. But  I'm neither very optimistic nor very pessimistic. I expect the  leaders to do the best they can under the circumstances.""    Meanwhile, University of Durban-Westville political analyst  Kiru Naidoo said: ""It would be too much to expect a significant  breakthrough at this extremely late stage. I can't imagine  anything that can be arrived at that would pave the way for the  IFP's participation in elections. If (Friday's) meeting can  secure free and fair political activity, that is the most  significant thing one can expect. To reduce tension, we would  need King Zwelithini to urge his followers -- as difficult as  they would find the situation -- to allow the democratic process  to continue unhindered.""     "

0,FT923-4870 ,"FT923-4870 _AN-CIEASAA8FT 920904   FT  04 SEP 92 / Collor scandal has put Brazil's economic reforms on ice: Political uncertainty has frozen the process of financial modernisation and seen old evils return      By CHRISTINA LAMB   TO MANY Brazilian businessmen 1992 has been a wasted year in the quest for economic stabilisation. They have already transferred their hopes to next year. In some ways, however, the economy has proved remarkably resilient to the corruption scandal which this week led to the initiation of an impeachment process against President Fernando Collor. Since the scandal began in May, stock markets have swung with the day's rumours but the currency has remained stable. August's monetary expansion was the lowest this year at 15 per cent and this week the central bank succeeded in selling Dollars 1bn of government bonds. Investment decisions are generally on hold, though the central bank said yesterday that the stock market last month suffered a net outflow of Dollars 80m in foreign capital. What apparent stability there is is a tribute to Mr Marcilio Marques Moreira, the economy minister, who says his biggest achievement has been preventing Mr Collor resorting to massive spending or an economic shock programme alleviating the recession in the hope of winning some popularity. 'You can't imagine how many people are going to the president each day and suggesting this,' he says. However the political uncertainty is producing a return to the process of protective pricing, pushing inflation above the 20 to 22 per cent a month level it has stuck at for almost a year. Mr Moreira, who once predicted 2 per cent inflation by December, now admits that 'to push inflation down in this climate is very difficult and I don't expect it to decrease much this year'. The 'Collorgate' crisis has had even worse effects on the government's attempts to balance its budget, distracting congressional attention from a USDollars 20bn tax reform package which the ministry warns must be approved this year if Brazil is to avoid 'fiscal disaster' and the collapse of its agreement with the International Monetary Fund. Failure to implant fiscal reform means the economic team is continuing to rely on a policy of high interest rates as its only weapon against inflation. This has deepened industrial recession, causing a fall in tax revenues, while domestic debt grew 156 per cent in real terms in the first six months of this year - a problem the central bank governor refers to as 'the elephant in the basement'. More than 40 per cent of next year's budget is devoted to debt servicing and amortisation. Tax revenues are expected to be down 13 per cent this year partly because of increased evasion spurred by the revelation of high-level corruption. Next year's deficit-based budget, completed this week, highlights the parlous state of government finances. Unable to increase revenues, the government plans 22 per cent cuts in investment. This follows a 35 per cent, or USDollars 8bn, reduction this year. Mr Moreira admits: 'It's incredible how things are not collapsing with the cuts we have made.' Some Brazilian economists argue that the country is trapped in a cycle where tight money produces deeper recession leading to falling tax revenues and the issuing of more domestic debt to raise funds. The policy is taking its toll on the private sector. Last year 249 of Brazil's 500 biggest companies finished in the red with combined losses of USDollars 2.5bn. Some joke that the only people making money are those selling black cloth for use in the anti-Collor demonstrations. But there is some good news. This year's exports are expected to reach a record USDollars 36bn-38bn, producing a surplus of Dollars 15bn, partly because of a strong agricultural performance. The country hopes to achieve growth this year of 2 to 3 per cent compared with 1 per cent last year. Liquid foreign exchange reserves are at the record level of USDollars 21bn, reflecting high foreign capital inflows - USDollars 7.7bn in the first five months. Mr Collor's supporters claim that the corruption charges against him were provoked by objections of 'invested interests' to his modernisation programme of dismantling cartels and reducing tariff barriers. They are now spreading fears that a government led by Mr Itamar Franco, the man who would take over in the event of Mr Collor's ouster, would abandon this and resort to a shock programme, wasting all Mr Moreira's efforts at austerity. However, what Mr Collor has done is forge a consensus behind modernisation which it would be difficult to go against. Mr Ulysses Guimaraes, an opposition congressman, says: 'History will give Collor credit because he had the courage to confront monsters and taboos in the economy.'

Nelson Mandela talks about the  obstacles that the new South African democracy encounters in its  path: the white extremists and the black ones. He promises to  practice an ""open-door policy"" toward the international  community, without ""tyrannizing"" investors. Pre-election  opinion polls give the ANC 60 percent of the votes.    [Emiliani] Mr. Chairman, apartheid in South Africa is  officially dead. The blacks have finally gained admission to  the transitional government whose task is to organize the first  free general election, to be held on 27 April. And yet the  enemies of peace and democracy in the country seem to be  multiplying. Who are the die-hards?    [Mandela] The toughest opposition to the transitional  government currently comes from Mangosuthu Buthelezi's Inkatha  Freedom Party and some of its fellow members of the Freedom  Alliance. They sit at the negotiating table with us and do  nothing but pursue an ""all or nothing"" tactic. Inkatha above  all does not favor mediation, whereas the ANC -- the African  National Congress -- has made mediation the rule so that as many  sides as possible may be involved in the negotiations and the  greatest number of political demands can be taken into account.  Believe me, we are doing all we can to stop Inkatha and the  other parties in the Freedom Alliance from walking out of the  negotiations, now and again going far beyond the limits that we  had set, just to keep the negotiations open.    [Emiliani] But the opposition in South Africa is now an  armed opposition, and violence is spreading throughout the  country. Which do you consider the more dangerous: the  extremism of the whites, the hard-liners who want a return to  apartheid, or that of the more radical black groups?    [Mandela] The African National Congress has never refused to  talk to the right-wing groups, Inkatha and the Afrikaner  People's Front included. As far as we have been able to  establish, some of the leaders of the Afrikaner People's Front  are inclined to be reasonable and are perfectly aware how  dangerous it is to threaten civil war at the drop of a hat. Our  discussions with them have been fruitful, and we are  understanding one another better. Unfortunately, I cannot say  the same of our talks with Inkatha. At times we come out of the  negotiations with Buthelezi's party with the distinct feeling  that we have made not the slightest step forward in mutual  understanding. Nevertheless, we shall continue talking with  Inkatha in the hope of persuading them to take part in the  negotiating process again, and above all in the election on 27  April.    [Emiliani] So what point have the transitional government's  negotiations with the parties forming the Freedom Alliance  reached?    [Mandela] As such, the transitional government, or rather  the transitional executive council, is not negotiating with the  Freedom Alliance. It is a structure conceived under the interim  constitution to organize and monitor the election, an election  that must be free and fair. The negotiations involve all the  parties and organizations forming the transitional executive  council, which have made some, albeit still inadequate, progress  in the course of the negotiations. We are doing our best to  speed things up, but there are limits beyond which we cannot go,  issues on which we cannot compromise, such as the date of the  election itself, which is set for 27 April.    [Emiliani] What is the ANC in particular doing in this  connection?    [Mandela] The ANC's role in the negotiations is absolutely  central. We are the guardians of the mediation process, and we  are conducting it in the most all-inclusive manner, placing the  interests of South Africa above any party interest.    [Emiliani] The more radical black groups, too, are raising  difficulties and rejecting the negotiations. How are relations  between the ANC and the Pan-African Congress at the moment?    [Mandela] We are both liberation movements. There are  obviously differences between us, but we are working together as  partners in the mediation process. We are pleased that the  Pan-African Congress has decided to take part in the 27 April  election.    [Emiliani] And what about relations between the ANC and  AZAPO, the Azanian People's Organization?    [Mandela] Our relations with AZAPO, too, take account of  the fact that we are both organizations working for the  liberation of the oppressed black people of South Africa.  However, we are different organizations, and the ANC is  exterting strong pressure on AZAPO to fight the election.  However, the fact that it has decided to boycott it does not  detract from its being an organization working for liberation.    [Emiliani] According to the latest opinion polls, the ANC  could win over 60 percent of the votes on 27 April. What is  your economic program, what are your priorities once you are in  government?    [Mandela] The opinion polls and the meetings that we are  holding all over South Africa so that people can inform the ANC  of their needs all point to the most sensitive issues being  unemployment, the housing shortage, lack of education, and  inadequate healthcare provision. As a people's liberation  movement, in other words a movement that sets out to meet the  people's needs, these are also the ANC's priorities.    [Emiliani] How have the business world and the international  economic community, reacted to the transitional government? Are  they showing confidence in South Africa?    [Mandela] I hope with all my heart that they start to  believe in South Africa again. Since the ANC's appeal to the  United Nations to repeal sanctions, the response has been  favorable, and the Johannesburg stock exchange has recently  shown a considerable increase in the volume of trade. Some  major international companies are still put off by the spread of  violence, but I am confident that as soon as we manage to create  a true democracy and take measures capable of putting an end to  the violence, we shall be able to create the conditions required  to attract further investment.    [Emiliani] What sort of policy does the ANC intend to pursue  toward foreign companies?    [Mandela] An open-door policy that avoids ""tyrannizing""  investors. What I mean is that we believe foreign investments  must not be penalized by over-restrictive currency regulations  and that the best way to attract them to South Africa is to give  companies a wider range of investment opportunities. We should  also like to see investment directed increasingly toward our  country's emerging black business class, which apartheid has  kept on the sidelines for a long time.    [Emiliani] One last question, Mr. Chairman. In your heart  of hearts, to whom have you dedicated your Nobel peace prize,  apart from the South African people?    [Mandela] You are right in saying that the courageous, long-  suffering South African people, deserves the Nobel peace prize.  Apart from South Africa, I believe that the president of the  Palestine Liberation Organization, Yasser Arafat, and the  Israeli prime minister, Yitzak Rabin, deserve it for the effort  that they are making to bring peace to the Middle East.

At special polling stations around the world, South Africans formed long queues, matched at home by lines of elderly and infirm 'special voters' for whom yesterday had been set aside. 'Today marks the dawn of our freedom,' said Mr Nelson Mandela, president of the African National Congress and almost certain successor to state president F. W. de Klerk. Mr Mandela urged all South Africans to go to the polls and help in the birth of a new South Africa: 'Today is a day like no other before it.' At midnight last night, the blue, white and orange flag of the old South Africa was ceremonially lowered around the country for the last time, closing an era of white domination that began in 1652. As the new flag fluttered aloft, choirs in Cape Town, Johannesburg and other regional centres sang the moving hymn of African nationalism, Nkosi Sikele i'Afrika (God bless Africa). Although voters gathered outside stations well before the opening time of 7am some had to stand for hours. Ballot papers were delivered late, there were shortages of polling officers and the voting process to select candidates for both the country's national assembly and nine provincial legislatures was cumbersome. At some stations, the closing time of 7pm was extended. With 22.3m eligible voters, the high turnout expected today coupled with yesterday's difficulties may mean that voting, scheduled to end tomorrow night, may have to continue on Friday. Results are due to start being released from Friday morning unless polling is extended. The ANC complained that several voting stations in the Transkei and Orange Free State had opened late or stayed closed for the day, and accused officials of the Inkatha Freedom party of intimidating voters. However, Mr Pallo Jordan, ANC information head, said he saw no need for any annulment of results and was confident that the Independent Electoral Commission, responsible for organising the poll, would be able to address the 'teething problems'. The IEC's vice-chairman, Mr Dikgang Moseneke, conceded that the commission had 'hopelessly underestimated' the problems. The IFP - which decided only eight days ago to participate in the elections  -said many ballots were without the sticker carrying the party's logo and photograph of Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, its leader, which is supposed to have been fixed to the bottom of the paper. 'It savours of sabotage,' said Chief Buthelezi, who said he had requested that the IEC allow for an extra 'two or three days' of voting. Any ballot without the IFP sticker will be counted as a spoiled ballot, according to IFP officials. The electoral commission intends, however, to exempt from that requirement those who voted outside the country. Mr Mandela, due to cast his vote today in Natal, dismissed fears that the rash of recent bombings might hamper the polling. He said the full force of state intimidation had never stopped the struggle for freedom. No serious incidents of violence were reported as more than 100,000 soldiers, police and reservists were deployed in and around 9,000 polling centres. Bomb blasts since Sunday have killed at least 21 people and injured over 160 in attacks attributed to extreme right-wingers.

The result of  the general election showed that the last apartheid system,  which was also the most inhumane one in the world, has come to  an end; and a new South Africa with racial equality is born.  The vast number of black people being oppressed under the  racist rule in South Africa have stood up today, and they,  together with white people, have become masters of the country.  The success of the first multiracial general election in South  Africa was not only a significant event in the political life of  the South African people and the African people as a whole, but  was also an event of great historical significance in, and with  far-reaching impact on, the history of human civilization in  this century. The Chinese people always firmly support the just  struggle of the South African people, and also heartily rejoice  at the historic victory scored by the South African people. We  extend warm congratulations to them.    In order to achieve today's universal suffrage, the people  of  South Africa continued to fight for more than 300 years. In  particular, after the ANC was founded in 1912, it led the black  people in the country to carry out prolonged and unremitting  struggle against apartheid and racial discrimination and to  fight for South African black people's equal political and  economic rights. Their struggle drove the racist regime into  dire straits, made the authorities realize that they could no  longer maintain racist rule, and forced them to hold peace  talks. Constitutional talks began in December 1991. The  multiparty talks, which lasted more than two years and were  attended by the ANC and more than 20 other political parties,  underwent innumerous twists and turns and encountered many  obstacles, because there were different opinions and interest  conflicts between various parties, and the far-right wing of the  white people continued to stir up trouble and provoke conflicts.  However, backed by Mandela and De Klerk, representatives of  most political parties cherished the spirit of racial  reconciliation and democratic consultation, continued to make  joint efforts to remove various difficulties and obstacles, and  eventually achieved significant results in advancing the process  of peace and democracy in South Africa.    Today's victory won by the people of South Africa is also  inseparable from extensive assistance and support from other  African countries and peoples, especially the great assistance  and sacrifice made by the forefront countries in Southern  Africa. The Organization of African Unity, the United Nations,  other international organizations, and the international  community as a whole have also made positive contributions to  supporting the struggle of the South African people. Because  the struggle of the South African people won extensive support  and assistance from all justice-upholding and peace-loving  people inside and outside the country, the situation in South  Africa could develop in an orientation favorable to the people's  progress.    The success of the first whole-people-involved election in  South Africa does not indicate the end of the South African  people's struggle. An extremely small number of far-rightists  among the white people are not willing to see the collapse of  the racist system, and they will continue to stir up trouble and  carry out sabotage. The differences among various organizations  of the black people have not been completely solved. It will be  hard to eliminate the influence of the long-standing racist rule  and violent conflicts within a short time. However, people  believe that the South African people, who have freed themselves  from the shackles of the apartheid system, will certainly be  able to overcome difficulties, and continue to advance along the  course of racial reconciliation and national peace and  stability. A new South Africa with democracy, equality, peace,  and prosperity will certainly appear on the continent of Africa.     "

0,FT943-15254 ,"FT943-15254 _AN-EGKDTAA3FT 940711   FT  11 JUL 94 / International Press Review: No fire behind smoke - South Africa   In a week in which the South Africa's press were unable to discover just what were the 'personal reasons' that lay behind finance minister Derek Keys' unexpected departure on Tuesday, there were several other fascinating but unanswered questions. How would President Nelson Mandela placate Mrs Marike de Klerk, the former president's wife, whose fury at being forced to move from Libertas, the official presidential residence in Pretoria, was disclosed by the Afrikaans daily, Beeld? Could Mr F W de Klerk's eviction have anything to do with the disappearance of Dinky, the family dog, whose plight was reported in the Pretoria News? And could the Springboks rugby team recover from their defeat against the All Blacks? the Sunday Tribune asked. However, for several days, a single question was uppermost for all papers: Why did Mr Keys resign? After much speculation, South Africa's press shared the conclusion of the Weekly Mail, the independent paper. 'Keys: no fire behind the smoke'. Shaun Johnson, deputy editor of The Star, the city's afternoon paper, put the best face on the affair: Keys 'did the most difficult of things, quitting while he was right on top . . . the retrospective portrait will be one of unflamboyant glory,' he wrote in his weekly column. He would be known as the man who laid down a solid economic foundation for a new government, 'his reputation unsullied by the worst excesses of bygone National party cabinets and untarnished by the inevitable failings of the African National Congress controlled one'. Keys established a psychological precedent, wrote Johnson, selling to the middle classes 'the concept of a tax surcharge' - a reference to the budget's 5 per cent levy on higher-bracket tax payers. No such generous treatment from The Citizen, whose editor Johnnie Johnstone has managed to pay generous tribute to President Mandela while maintaining a conservative stance. Easily the best paper of record, with a large black readership attracted - according to conventional wisdom - by the paper's comprehensive racing coverage, the Citizen's midweek editorial spared neither Keys nor government. 'It's not satisfactory, Mr Keys. You should have stayed on. But as you have resigned, you owe it to the country to say exactly why. 'As for the government, we think its handling of the matter putrid.' Johannesburg's Business Day, which had added to the confusion by confidently reporting that Mr Chris Liebenberg, the successor to Mr Keys, 'had already attended (cabinet) meetings as finance minister designate', expressed city sentiment. The resignation 'presents the government of national unity, still basking in the afterglow of its remarkable installation, with the most difficult test it has faced so far', said Wednesday's editorial. By the end of the week, however, interest had focused on another question: Who benefitted from insider trading in the hours before the Mr Keys' resignation became official? asked the Sunday Times. And one question was never raised. Why did the powerful Congress of South African of Trade Unions accuse Mr Keys of letting the side down and 'betraying Mandela's trust' by leaving early, instead of saying good riddance to Mr Keys? After all, he was the finance minister who advocated fiscal discipline, and refused to bend to union pleas to extend VAT zero rating to more foods Maybe in the answer to this question lay the secret of Mr Keys' success.

It has ""sabotaged"" the meeting planned for 18 March  between Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini and Nelson Mandela.

King Goodwill Zwelithini's words were in a similar vein.""  BUSINESS DAY says it seems Inkatha President Buthelezi ""fears  allowing the king to be exposed to Mandela's powers of  persuasion."" Buthelezi invited ""all and sundry"" to the  Zwelithini-Mandela meeting, and ""switched the venue from inside  the legislative assembly buildings to the grounds outside, so  that it would become an Inkatha jamboree of royals, chiefs and  subjects, with Mandela uncomfortably at the centre."" ""Inkatha  has made valid objections to the interim constitution, and its  obduracy has won concessions. It could still win more through  international mediation. But this does not mean it can continue  holding the country to ransom.""

""The far-right must  give serious thought to this and several other issues; they will  realize that the old South Africa is gone for ever."" ""But the  finger of the Bophuthatswana mess also points accusingly at the  ANC, its leaders, and its unbridled followers. In Cape Town  Major General Bantu Holomisa declared gleefully that  Bophuthaswana had received a stiff dose of `Vitamin ANC', and  that kwaZulu was next in line. His statement at an election  event let the cat out of the bag. Worried South Africans now  have reason to expect that the ANC `vitamins' form part of its  election plan for the rest of the country."" ""It is time,"" warns  RAPPORT, ""that ANC leaders get it into their heads that South  Africa needs no revolution but an orderly transition to a new  constitutional dispensation, managed under strict Western  democratic standards. But the ANC leadership does not concern  itself with the brain drain or the millions of rands fleeing the  country. All one hears is the old refrain that whites need nor  fear the ANC."" ""If the AWB is guilty of hot-headed stupidity,  the ANC's plundering hordes are just as guilty. Mr. Nelson  Mandela is not doing nearly enough to curb his party's lust for  power and its arrogance.""

The waste stems from chemicals, paint  residues, and other dangerous substances from a closed-down  plant of the former GDR. After news of the illegal transport  had been received, the approximate 200 tonnes of waste were  placed in temporary storage in Hungary. It was said in Budapest  that those responsible for the toxic waste scandal cannot be  made answerable for it because the relevant legislation contains  loopholes and the persons responsible have disappeared. The  toxic waste, which Germany is getting back ""after long talks,""  is to be handed over at the Austro-German border. Storage and  transport costs amount to about 170,000 marks.    In 1993, Lower Saxony exported almost half its toxic waste  to  other German laender and abroad. Altogether, some 417,562  tonnes of special waste were disposed of, said the general  manager of the Lower Saxon Company for the Disposal of Special  Waste, Schulze- Rickmann, yesterday. In addition, there were  several hundred thousand tonnes of toxic waste that were  disposed of by producers internally.     "

The foreign secretary said he would be discussing how the aid could be best used when attending the inauguration of Mr Nelson Mandela as president on May 10. The Pounds 100m will be made available by the Overseas Development Administration from its existing budget.

Our southern African correspondent Fergal Keane  talked to Mr. Mandela earlier today in Johannesburg and asked  him first for his reaction to the initial [election] results.    [Begin recording] [Mandela] They are encouraging, because  they reflect the feelings, the hopes, and aspirations of our  people. I think the best way of looking at the results is not to  do so from the point of view of which party is winning and which  is losing. We must look at them from the point of view that,  for the first time in the history of the country, the people of  South Africa, have had the opportunity to exercise the most  important right of a citizen. That is the approach, and I think  if one looks at it from that angle, we will all be excited by  the results.    [Keane] Nevertheless, it looks like the ANC will have a  comfortable majority. You will be the president, while your own  supporters will be pleased by that. There are frightened  minorities out there, particularly white people, who fear that  they may be marginalized or punished by an ANC government. What  do you say today to reassure those people?    [Mandela] If one looks at our record, he will find that  there  is no real basis for those fears and concerns, because we have a  long record, stretching over years, over decades, of nation-  building, of promoting the spirit of reconciliation, and that  has become even more clearer since I was released from jail.  Therefore, we are concerned with the fears of the minority. If  one looks at our record, he will find that there is no basis for  those fears, although we acknowledge that they are genuine?    [Keane] But you would say to whites that South Africa is a  home for them in the future?    [Mandela] We have said that repeatedly in the meetings that  we have addressed in the run-up to these elections [words  indistinct] our basic priority on which we are not compromising  is to address the basic needs of the masses of the people. To  be specific: the creation of jobs; [words indistinct] provision  of a free, compulsory, universal quality education; the  introduction of electricity, running water, flush toilets, paved  roads, those are our basic priorities and we cannot compromise  on that. But at the same time, we are keen not to lower the  standards of the minorities in this country, in particular the  whites.    [Keane] Now, this election has been a terrible emotional  time  for many people, particularly the black majority. Your own  parents grew up and died without ever having the vote. What do  you think they would feel now if they saw their son on the verge  of becoming president?    [Mandela] They would feel very excited as much as we do that  our people at last, after many sacrifices, during which many  people have paid with their own lives. Nevertheless, we are now  there, we have realized our dreams and aspirations.    [Keane] My final question to you. Following you around the  country for the past four years since your release from prison,  I have heard you say again and again to large crowds of people:  I love each and every one of you and you said you want to put  them in the pocket of your shirt so that you can look at them  every day. Just tell me something about that, about the love you  feel for the people in this land?    [Mandela] Before I went to jail, during my life in jail, and  afterward, I have come across great South Africans from all  population groups -- Africans, Coloreds, Indians, Afrikaners,  English-speaking South Africans, who love their country and  their people. What I am saying, I am expressing something which  is in the hearts of every South African. That is one of the  things that has encouraged all of us about the future of our  country. We have got a wonderful country. We have got a bright  future. [end recording]     "

The policy is a response to this month's agreement between the Pretoria government and the African National Congress on establishing a transitional executive council to pave the way to an end of white minority rule. The announcement in Brussels yesterday comes nine days before President F W de Klerk and Mr Nelson Mandela, president of the ANC, are due to come to Brussels to address the EC/African, Caribbean and Pacific Joint Assembly. Mr de Klerk and Mr Mandela are expected to outline ideas on how to develop EC-South African trade links. These are likely to take place outside the Lome Convention, the trade deal between the EC and the 69 ACP countries.

Northern proposes to construct and operate two new delivery points for Sioux City Brick and Tile Company (SCBT) located in Dallas and Woodbury Counties, Iowa. Northern states that it would deliver, on an interruptible basis, up to 1,000 Mcf per day and 270,000 Mcf per year at the Dallas County delivery point and up to 1,000 Mcf per day and 207,000 Mcf per year at the Woodbury delivery point under its existing transportation rate schedules. Northern mentions that SCBT will contribute to the estimated $130,634 construction cost.    Northern states that it is currently providing service to other shippers for delivery of gas to facilities operated by Midwest Gas, a Division of Midwest Power Systems, Inc. for redelivery to SCBT in Dallas and Woodbury Counties. Northern also states that upon approval of this application, it would provide direct service to SCBT at the two new delivery points. Northern asserts that it has sufficient capacity to accommodate the changes proposed in this application without detriment or disadvantage to its other customers.

Sabine proposes to abandon three sales taps, all located in Jefferson County, Texas. Centana Intrastate Pipeline Company (Centana) has acquired the assets of Winnie Pipeline Company (Winnie) and the majority of pipeline assets of Neches Gas Distribution Company (Neches). All of the sales taps, the NGDC/Port Neches, NGDC/Port Arthur and Star/Port Neches are no longer needed to provide gas service due to the Winnie/Jefferson interconnection, which was completed by Sabine and Winnie.

Transwestern states that, because it is also conveying to TGC other facilities that are nonjurisdictional, it requests any permissions and approvals which the Commission deems necessary to permit their transfer to TGC.    Transwestern states that TGC intends to file with the Commission a Petition for a Declaratory Order seeking a determination that the subject facilities, upon the conveyance thereof, are gathering facilities exempt from the Commission's jurisdiction under NGA Section 7(b). Transwestern requests that its application be consolidated with TGC's petition to be filed in the near future.         "," FR941130-2-00014   FR941130-2-00008        3.

0,FT941-14563 ,"FT941-14563 _AN-EATCKAA1FT 940120   FT  20 JAN 94 / Indian tax probe sends shares into fall      By STEFAN WAGSTYL      NEW DELHI   Indian share prices fell yesterday after income tax inspectors announced the extension of a long-running probe into the affairs of Mr Harshad Mehta, the stockbroker at the centre of the 1992 securities market scandal. The Bombay Stock Exchange index fell 125.11 points to 3,825.91 amid reports of panic selling of blocks of shares which investors feared might become subject to the investigation. Stockbrokers said that the market had in any case been ripe for a fall after a 54 per cent rise since early November prompted by large-scale foreign buying. The income tax inspectors' investigation began in 1992 after Mr Mehta was arrested for his alleged involvement in the Rs42bn (Pounds 900m) scandal which rocked the Bombay securities market. Mr Mehta and others were accused of trading illegally in the inter-bank securities market in order to siphon funds into the stock market. Last October, trading was disrupted when it emerged the tax authorities had frozen dealings in blocks of stock which they said were being held by others on Mr Mehta's behalf. The authorities then specified blocks of shares in nine leading companies held by 134 individuals and companies. Yesterday they added shares of a further 20 companies held by 608 individuals and companies.   Countries:-  INZ  India, Asia.   Industries:-  P6231 Security and Commodity Exchanges.

No column, commentary or Sunday morning sound bite on Washington's wave of  scandals explains the underlying dynamic more clearly than the sage words of a  Southern demagogue. Willie Stark whispered them to his reluctant protege Jack  Burden in ""All The King's Men,"" Robert Penn Warren's classic 1946 novel of  political ambition and corruption. ""There is always something,"" Stark said,  sending Burden off to find scandal rotting in the past of a seemingly upright  opponent. ""Man is conceived in sin and born in corruption . . . . There is  always something.""    Almost daily the headlines honor Stark (or, more accurately, Penn Warren) as a  bilious prophet. This year's parade of political and personal scandals has  offered ""something"" for everyone: politicians apparently enriching themselves  with special favors from wealthy supporters; lobbyists enriching themselves by  wiring federal grants at the Department of Housing and Urban Development; House  members of all ideological and sexual persuasions -- from liberal homosexual  Barney Frank (D-Mass.) to conservative heterosexual Donald E. Lukens (R-Ohio)  -- enmeshing themselves in grimy webs of lapsed morality. All this after the  indiscretions of Gary Hart, the investigations of Edwin Meese III and the  rejection of John G. Tower. We may be nearing a point where the most useful  capital directory might be one compiled by Masters and Johnson.    All this takes a predictable toll on the public view of politicians. Trust in  Congress and other national institutions, including the Supreme Court, has  eroded under the acid drip of revelation. In California, having endured federal  and local investigations of the Legislature and the questionable financial  dealings of Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley, more than 40% of residents surveyed  in a recent Field poll said they did not consider local and state politicians  honest.    Does this mean today's elected officials are more venal, more corrupt than  their predecessors? Probably not. Remember, there is always something. No code  of conduct has ever repealed the immutable law of human imperfection. What  makes current scandals so notorious is intensified press coverage -- plus a  lack of offsetting good works in the political ledger. Washington has been  defined by its scandals largely because it has offered so little else to define  itself. In Sacramento the same has been true. Along with the sense that  government is corrupt and immoral comes a belief that it is incapable of  grappling with basic problems.    That widespread disaffection corrodes government's ability to function -- and  virtually invites more scandal. As people have lost faith in governmental good  works, they have both demanded less of it and given it less attention. With  politics receiving less attention, campaigns increasingly turn on tactical  advantage -- which side can mobilize more money to rush a fleeting message past  a distracted electorate. Squeezing money from special interests -- whose needs  breed scandal like swamp flies -- becomes the first order of political  survival. In 1988, the candidate who spent more won 414 of the 435 House races,  and 29 of the 33 Senate races, according to exhaustive research by the Center  for Responsive Politics.    As those numbers suggest, few candidates have found issues compelling enough to  overcome financial disadvantage. Concern about ethics isn't likely to change  that. Individual members implicated may face problems next fall, but there's no  sign of a wave developing to flush the rascals out. Polls show that voters  don't give either party any edge for ethical rectitude. The conviction that all  politicians are dirty dilutes the political force of the accompanying disgust.    ""This might contribute to some kind of greater anti-incumbent sentiment,"" said  GOP pollster William McInturff, ""but I'm not even sure of that because people  may not believe the next round of challengers are any different.""    Yet elected officials are eager to further inoculate themselves. Talk of ethics  reform is rampant in Congress; how much reform is another matter. The Senate is  drafting an ethics package; the House is likely to take up ethics reform by  mid-October, and perhaps also consider further campaign finance restrictions.  Yet the most eagerly sought ethics change, a ban on honorariums from special  interests, will be difficult to achieve without a pay raise, a fight many  legislators may not wish to revisit. Major campaign finance reform is unlikely  because there is no consensus behind public financing, the key to imposing  spending limits. ""We are pretty much dead in the water on that,"" said Rep. Vic  Fazio (D-Sacramento), who heads a bipartisan House task force studying ethics  rules.    In California, the state Assembly is expected to join the Senate in passing a  substantial package of reforms later this month, including restrictions on  honorariums and gifts, and new controls on the use of campaign funds for  personal benefit. Attorney General John K. Van de Kamp, front-runner for the  Democratic gubernatorial nomination, wants to put a much more ambitious package  before the voters, one limiting state legislators to 12 years in office. Among  politicians the idea is anathema. For that reason alone, it may prove extremely  popular with voters.    All these changes could be salutary; approved, they would probably diminish  public belief that government is bought. But they won't eliminate mistrust  altogether, because such reforms by themselves can't end the gridlock that  symbolizes government's breakdown. Ethics rules alone can't solve the problems  that create the demand for them.    More than the paralyzing influence of special-interest money has tied up both  Congress and the state Legislature. Government is not moving boldly at any  level; few politicians have a clear sense of where they want to take it. After  lively debates on government's role in the early Reagan years, Washington is in  a period of pause. Through the first eight months of the Bush Administration,  neither party has shown much ideological passion.    Having abandoned Reagan's anti-government bromides, Bush has only replaced them  with the pragmatic problem-solving he ridiculed during the campaign. And  Democrats have been remarkably reticent about confronting Bush, uncertain about  their own identity after the third straight presidential blowout.    Nothing in politics is static. As in science, the observation of a phenomenon  changes it. As politicians are accused of being frozen and ineffective, they  instinctively bustle. Some signs are encouraging. Many observers, for example,  believe criticism of the California Legislature's inaction helps explain the  compromise reached over gasoline taxes and the current willingness to consider  serious ethical reforms. ""Legislators are finally getting a real sense of the  low regard in which the public holds them. And I think they are fairly  uncomfortable with that,"" said Walter Zelman, executive director of California  Common Cause. The uncharacteristic boldness of an achingly conventional  officeholder like Van de Kamp may foreshadow changing times.    Similarly, the new Democratic leaders in Congress, well aware of the damage to  their reputations from the Jim Wright and Tony Coelho scandals -- and more  recently from the misadventures of a male prostitute attached to Frank's office  -- are anxious to present a more purposeful image. ""If we don't do anything  between now and November, 1990, then there is a vacuum,"" acknowledged one  senior aide in the House Democratic leadership. ""On the other hand, if we pass  a clean-air bill, if we pass a child-care bill, and we do something in terms of  oil-spill legislation, about education, we do something about drugs, then I  think people will feel we're getting some things done.""    That analysis rings true. As long as both parties are mired in tactical debates  and incremental tinkering with the edges of fundamental needs, scandal will cut  more deeply.    In politics, there is always something corrupt; the issue is whether there is  also something inspiring or ennobling to balance the picture. In small times,  even small lapses loom large.

Four years and three months ago I said in parliament that the time had come for us to break out of the cycle of conflict, tension and violent struggle in which we had been embroiled for decades. During the past week we have seen the realisation of that vision. After so many centuries, we will finally have a government which represents all South Africans. All South Africans are now free. During the past four years Mr Mandela has played. . . a leading and an honourable role. I thank him and congratulate him. He deserves the congratulations, good wishes and prayers of all South Africans. During the past four years we have proved we can work together. Despite our differences, our relationship has become a symbol of the ability of South Africans from widely different backgrounds to co-operate in the national interest. This spirit will be essential to the success of the government of national unity. Mr Mandela has walked a long road and now stands at the top of the hill. A traveller would sit down and admire the view. But a man of destiny knows that beyond this hill lies another and another. The journey is never complete. As he contemplates the next hill I hold out my hand in friendship and in co-operation. As far as my own position is concerned, I should like to make clear that I believe that my political task is just beginning. Everything that we have done so far - the four years of difficult and often frustrating negotiations, the problems and the crises - have been simply a preparation for the work that lies ahead. The greatest challenge which we will face in the government of national unity will be to defend and nurture our new constitution. Our greatest task will be to ensure our young and vulnerable democracy will take root and flourish. I will be in a good position in the government of national unity. I will not be there at the whim of any person or any party, but in my own right as the representative of many millions of South Africans. Just as we could not rule South Africa effectively without the support of the ANC and its supporters, no government will be able to rule South Africa effectively without the support of the people and the institutions that I represent. I enthusiastically pledge that support in the spirit of national reconciliation. The National party has. . . the recipe for the future and. . . one day we shall be the largest party in the country. Our objective will be to prove this at the polls in five years' time. This is an important milestone in the history of our country - perhaps the most important that we will ever see. Next Tuesday I shall lay down my responsibilities as state president, secure in the knowledge that we have achieved what we set out to achieve four years and three months ago. I shall be handing over the presidency to Mr Mandela, but I shall not be leaving government. I shall be surrendering power, not to the majority of the moment, but to the South African people. A power greater than man has given South Africa the spirit, the chance to go forward in peace. God almighty has been kind to us. Now it is up to the political leaders to join together for the good of our people and complete the task of healing and reconciliation. God bless South Africa. Nkosi sikelel i'Afrika.

Brazil, as an emerging power,  wanted to exert its influence over the Portuguese-speaking  countries that had recently become independent from Portugal.  Almost 20 years later, Itamaraty and a group of Brazilian  businessmen are playing their cards on a South Africa governed  by the African National Congress (ANC) of Nelson Mandela. But  the priorities are different: There is no longer the idea of  projecting Brazilian political influence, but rather that of  doing good business. From 13 to 20 March, just over one month  before the first South African elections in which the black  population will vote, a delegation of 34 Brazilian businessmen  headed by Celso Marcos Vieira, chief of the Trade Promotion  Department of the Foreign Ministry, made a commercial visit to  that country. The Brazilian companies were represented by large  companies such as Andrade Gutierrez, Norberto Odebrecht, Mendes  Junior, NEC of Brazil, Embraer [Brazilian Aeronautics Company],  Varig Airline, Furnas [Furnas Electric Power Plants, Inc.], and  Petrobras [Brazilian Petroleum Corporation]. Vieira said: ""The  time could have not been better: With this initiative we showed  confidence in the South African electoral process.""    The South African elections, which will put an end to 46  years of white minority government, will be held on 26, 27, and  28 April. Even with the growing political violence of the last  few months, the inauguration of Nelson Mandela on 10 May is  considered a sure thing by analysts, including those of  Itamaraty. The Brazilian delegation got ahead of possible  missions from Europe, the United States, and Japan. According  to Otavio Cardoso Pontes, director-superintendent of  Poliolefinas and one of the members of the Brazilian delegation,  Brazilian businessmen see many possibilities for bilateral trade  with South Africa, which is a country with a high level of  consumption and a well-developed infrastructure. Mandela's  representatives guaranteed the Brazilian businessmen that an  eventual ANC government would not implement a policy promoting  government intervention in the economy, as planned in the party  program.    The Brazilians met with heads of the ANC economic  departments  and with representatives of five different sectors (including  the National Federation of Africa Chamber of Commerce, which  includes only black businessmen) interested in joint ventures  and consultant services. The future for prospective Brazilian  deals in South Africa lies in the reconstruction and development  project that Mandela and his team have drafted. Vieira  commented that ""the ANC intends to build 1 million low cost  houses and to expand its electricity supply system. There is  lots of room for Brazilian companies in these areas."" Mandela's  supporters, moreover, are willing to review the energy policy  implemented so far by the government. The ANC intends to  minimize the African nuclear program which, it is believed,  includes nuclear bombs.    The ANC leaders are also quite interested in the  establishment of an economic bloc including Mercosur [Common  Market of the South] -- Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay  -- and South Africa, Angola, Mozambique, Tanzania, Zambia, and  Botswana. According to Minister Vieira, Brazil regards South  Africa as a doorway for the entry of Brazilian products into the  African markets. He added: ""They know how to negotiate with the  region, and this could be useful to the Brazilian businessmen.""    Although the ANC has asserted it does not have any  nationalization program in mind, it has asked to consult  Petrobras [Brazilian Petroleum Corporation] to determine whether  or not it is feasible to maintain the state monopoly in the oil  field. The Bank of Brazil has already opened credit lines with  the purpose of promoting bilateral trade. But the Brazilians'  visit to Mandela's country does not boil down to promises only.  At least one deal worth $3 million has already been closed:  The petrochemical industry Poliolefinas will buy raw material  from a South African company to manufacture polyethylene.  Minister Vieira exclaimed: ""We have discovered South Africa.""  What remains to be seen is whether Mandela's virtual election  will be enough to guarantee political stability in that country.  After all, Brazil's initiatives in all the Portuguese-speaking  African countries failed because they all were drowned by  endless civil wars.     "

0,FT932-1 ,"FT932-1 _AN-DGABBAGMFT 930630   FT  30 JUN 93 / Survey of Italy (13): Searching look at monopolies - Now media ownership is being investigated      By HAIG SIMONIAN   JUST as some Milanese journalists thought the corruption scandal might be dying down, a new line of inquiry has emerged to keep judges and the press occupied. This time, the magistrates eyes have focused on the media. In an unexpected twist, investigations on the allocation of valuable television broadcasting frequencies have presented magistrates with a fruitful line of inquiry. This issue has rekindled interest in the whole question of press and media ownership in Italy. In few other countries is the press so closely attached to big business and the relationship so slavishly reflected in editorial policy. Until last year, Italian law posed few limits on ownership of newspapers, magazines and even broadcasting, allowing a free-for-all with few parallels in the developed world. Though restrictions have now been imposed, they are relatively loose compared with other European countries. Proprietorial interference is regularly denied by all media sectors, in spite of most leading newspapers and news magazines invariably reflecting their owners' opinions. Arch-rivals Carlo De Benedetti and Silvio Berlusconi recently have been using their publications for a long-distance slanging match. Born out of differing views on the economy, it has developed into a tit-for-tat campaign of 'revelations' about alleged involvements in the corruption scandal. The battle has encouraged a form of investigative journalism not common in Italy by pitching talented editorial teams against each other. La Repubblica, the De Benedetti-controlled daily, is the best source of information on alleged misdemeanours of Mr Berlusconi's Fininvest company, while Panorama, the Berlusconi-controlled weekly, has specialised in 'exposes' on the De Benedetti group. The magistrates' inquiries have also taken the lid off another highly controversial aspect of media policy - the so-called Mammi law of the late 1980s, which attempted to impose order on the chaotic world of broadcasting. Here too, the focus is on Mr Berlusconi. The law, named after Mr Oscar Mammi, a former posts and telecommunications minister, sanctified Fininvest's control of Italy's three leading private television channels - a position many think places too much power in Mr Berlusconi's hands. But earlier this month, the new Ciampi government ordered a revision of the law. Foremost among the law's critics are Italy's newspaper proprietors, who claim Fininvest has used its strong position in TV broadcasting to take too large a slice of the overall advertising cake. The proprietors' criticisms backed by energetic lobbying has been influenced by the downturn in advertising during the recession. Though advertising revenues have fallen by less than 10 per cent for most newspapers in the past year, preliminary figures for this year suggest the drop is much sharper, with smaller regional papers being hardest hit. Added to Mr Berlusconi's troubles is the Italian authorities' plan to impose tough new rules on the use of advertising slots in sponsored TV shows. The 'breaks' - most common in the game shows pioneered by Fininvest channels - are an important source of revenue for the group. Typically, a show host cuts away from the contestants and scantily-clad show girls to extol the virtues of a sponsor's products. Fininvest claims curbs on breaks could cost it about L400bn a year. Fininvest's recent named association in the corruption scandal has also exacerbated matters for Mr Berlusconi's group. But it need hardly be embarrassed by the company it keeps. Other large companies with media interests, such as Fiat, Olivetti (controlled by Mr De Benedetti's Cir group) Ferruzzi and Eni, have already made their debuts before the magistrates for a variety of alleged kickbacks to politicians. The allegations of Fininvest's involvement in the corruption scandal come at a particularly sensitive time. The signing of a lucrative L420m contract by Mr Davide Giacalone, a consultant who helped Mr Mammi draft the original broadcasting rules, with Fininvest has come to light. Fininvest says the contract with Mr Giacalone was entirely above board and the renumeration reasonable for his level of expertise. The company has also responded to criticisms of its alleged media monopoly. It says in observing the Mammi law it has given up control of its three pay-TV channels for a minority stake. It has also sold Il Giornale, a highly-regarded Milan daily paper - though significantly, ownership passed to Mr Berlusconi's brother, Paolo. And its 45 per cent audience share of the three Fininvest TV channels is no higher than that of other single private television operators abroad, it claims Focus on the media has come at a time of unprecedented commercial ferment in the industry. Financial difficulties at Ferruzzi, the big private-sector industrial group, could soon put its newspaper (Il Messaggero) and national TV channel (Telemontecarlo) on the block. And Eni, the public-sector energy and chemicals group, has said Il Giorno, its Milan-based daily newspaper, is to be sold. Finding buyers in a recession will not be easy. The international media boom of the mid-80s, which saw the arrival of huge cross-border takeovers, has long gone and many of the big media groups which grew through acquisitions are focusing on debt reduction. Italian buyers could also prove difficult to find. The handful of very big companies such as Pirelli, have traditionally eschewed media interests and show no sign of changing their minds. Although their are indications that some smaller entrepreneurs could be interested, the assets likely to be for sale represent too big a mouthful for most of Italy's small-to-medium sized businesses leaders. But it is possible that bankers may try to assemble consortia of investors for some of the assets up for disposal. This is a solution being considered for Il Giorno, Eni's Milan-based newspaper. Otherwise, proprietors may find themselves holding on to media assets for longer than hoped.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                              WHO OWNS WHAT  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Owner/dominant shareholder                 Publication/broadcaster  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Fiat                                       Corriere della Sera                                            (indirectly)                                            La Stampa  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Cir (Carlo De Benedetti)                   La Repubblica                                            L'Espresso  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Ferruzzi                                   Il Messaggero                                            Telemontecarlo  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Fininvest (Silvio Berlusconi)              Canale 5                                            Italia 1                                            Rete 4  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Paolo Berlusconi                           Il Giornale  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Iri                                        RAI  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Eni                                        Il Giorno  ----------------------------------------------------------------------   Companies:-  Fiat.

Sources close to the hush-hush encounters say the king  has called for a sovereign Zulu state according to pre-1838  boundaries. This would encompass all of Natal, including  kwaZulu, and would stretch from the Drakensberg mountains to the  sea and from Mozambique to the Umzimvubu River in the south.    The demand runs directly contrary to speculation that the  monarch would adopt a less political role with the imminent  demise of the kwaZulu homeland, in a bid to secure his position  under a new dispensation.    With the failure this week of the trilateral talks between  the government, ANC [African National Congress] and Freedom  Alliance to reach agreement on outstanding constitutional  issues, the king has lost interest in remaining part of the new  South Africa, the sources say.    Arguing that the new dispensation would herald not only a  new  government, but a new state as well, one source noted: ""Before  conquest by Britain, the Zulus were a sovereign nation. Now  that the British are no longer ruling South Africa, we are not  obliged to remain part of it.""    Conspicuously absent from last week's pow-wow between  Zwelithini and De Klerk was kwaZulu chief minister Mangosuthu  Buthelezi. Buthelezi has clearly begun a strategic retreat from  the political frontline -- in the hope that an anti-election  call from his nephew will have wider appeal among Zulus. By  raising the spectre of a UDF [United Democratic Front]-style  campaign to boycott elections with the backing of a royal  decree, Zwelithini has sharpened the battle for his allegiance.    The ANC's decision to place its deputy secretary general,  Jacob Zuma, at the top of its Natal electoral list was in part a  strategy to win over the king, whom ANC president Nelson Mandela  last year lauded as the king of all South Africans."" But  efforts by Zuma have so far failed to produce a  Mandela-Zwelithini indaba [meeting]. Instead, when Zwelithini  decided to enter the heart of the debate, he arranged for a  private meeting with De Klerk.    Sources say De Klerk went further than Zuma's promise to  seek  a constitutional position for the monarch by hinting that a  post-election arrangement could secure him the constitutional  monarchy of South Africa. Zwelithini is said to have baulked at  the suggestion.    Said one source: ""(Zwelithini) looks over the border at  Swaziland and Lesotho and says: `They were far smaller than  (the Zulus) in my grandfather's time and now they have sovereign  kingdoms. Why should I settle for second best?'"" Among  Zwelithini's representatives in the talks are IFP [Inkatha  Freedom Party] chief executive officer Joe Matthews and Prince  Gideon Zulu. The government is represented by Constitutional  Development Minister Roelf Meyer and his Foreign Affairs  colleague, Pik Botha.    In the clearest reflection that Zwelithini's demands have  created a dilemma for the ANC and government alike, Meyer said  this week in an SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation]  interview that the king's demands were tantamount to a call for  secession. He declined to give details. A few hours later,  Mandela responded by calling upon the king to meet him rather  than De Klerk, who would not be in power after elections.    ANC sources this week claimed the king had already agreed to  meet a delegation of its Natal leaders, but that Zuma's absence  on an overseas visit had delayed the encounter.    Given the probability that the IFP will, together with its  allies, boycott the coming election, the king's move to centre  stage is a shrewd strategy. Inkatha leader Buthelezi and his  negotiators have exhausted their options for obtaining  concessions from the government and the ANC.    Now, faced with the task of organising an effective boycott,  the party is playing its trump card, observers say. The  exclusion of the word ""kwaZulu"" from the interim constitution  has strengthened Buthelezi's argument that the ANC and the  government cannot be trusted with the fate of the Zulu nation,  sources say.    It is unclear how Zwelithini plans to rule such a kingdom,  but it is likely that Buthelezi would retain his position as the  ""traditional prime minister to the Zulu monarch.""     "

Instead, prime minister Andreas Papandreou's list of candidates reads like an exercise in personal debt repayment. Angela Kokkola, Papandreou's secretary for a couple of decades until his new wife Dimitra decided she wanted the job, is for instance certain to win one of the 25 seats. Journalist Yannis Roubatis has another safe slot. Once Papandreou's loyal spokesman, Roubatis was caught up in the backwash of the Bank of Crete embezzlement scandal which toppled the government in 1988, and kept him on the sidelines for quite some time too. The opposition, meanwhile, has made a stab at sprucing up its image by including the well-known singer Nana Mouskouri. Sadly, she is so rarely sighted in Athens that many Greeks think she is French. Alketas Panagoulias, who is coaching the Greek soccer team for its first appearance in the World Cup this summer, is another unusual choice. However, if Greece's 5-0 thrashing by England at Wembley last week is anything to go by, Panagoulias might find the bright lights of Brussels an attractive proposition next season.

Jose Abrantes, has been fired for ""great  deficiency"" in this Communist nation's first drug trafficking scandal, the  official newspaper Granma said today.    It said in a front-page announcement signed by President Fidel Castro that the  Communist Party Politburo decided to name Gen. Abelardo Colome Ibarra as new  interior minister, a job diplomats say ranks third in Cuba's power structure.    Abrantes, a well-known figure and long-time associate of Castro and his younger  brother, Raul, became the first high-level government casualty in the scandal  involving top Gen. Arnaldo Ochoa Sanchez, a hero of the Cuban revolution.    Granma said the Politburo decided to fire Abrantes in view ""of the great  deficiency in the direction of the Interior Ministry in relation to the conduct  of a group of officials who during 2 1/2 years carried out with impunity drug  trafficking operations.""    Ochoa and six accomplices, including Interior Ministry Col.

It said in a front-page announcement signed by President Fidel Castro that the  Communist Party Politburo decided to name Gen.

Abrantes, a well-known figure and long-time associate of Castro and his younger  brother, Raul, became the first high-level government casualty in the scandal  involving top Gen. Arnaldo Ochoa Sanchez, a hero of the Cuban revolution.    Granma said the Politburo decided to fire Abrantes in view ""of the great  deficiency in the direction of the Interior Ministry in relation to the conduct  of a group of officials who during 2 1/2 years carried out with impunity drug  trafficking operations.""

""It is an important milestone in our march  to liberation to have an indigenous African as president after  centuries of racist, colonial rule,"" Mr Makwetu said.    The events of the past few weeks had been breathtaking. The  huge voter turnout at elections had demonstrated ""a deep hunger  for democracy among our people"".    The PAC welcomed Mr Mandela's wide-ranging and balanced  state  of the nation address.    It also supported Mr Mandela's intention to subscribe to the  United Nations' Declaration on Human Rights, and asked that  detention without trial not be used again. People who had  committed offences in the struggle against apartheid should be  released unconditionally. Other offenders should be released at  the discretion of the government of the day.    The PAC welcomed Mr Mandela's emphasis on development and  empowerment. Housing and job creation were important in a  society where 8-million people lived in shacks. However, the  government had to resist the temptation to borrow money and had  to keep inflation in check.     "

President Mandela emphasized his concern  over the youth by adding that he will forfeit one-third of his  salary to a fund to help street children, and children in  detention, and poor children who wish to study.

If  that is what the commissioner fears, he should say so outright.  His fears are apparently not totally unfounded. By spelling  out his opposition to the commission honestly, he will achieve  more and hopefully ensure that the commission exposes the whole  truth and, more important, achieves genuine reconciliation. The  commission will only succeed in its aim if it is seen to be fair  and just towards all parties, and if it probes in all directions  impartially. If that is what the police chief is aiming at,  then he ought to be given support.""    Child Health and Care -- A second editorial on page 10 of  the  same issue of BEELD says: ""It is disturbing that South Africa  has fallen so far behind in the provision of health and other  care to its children....According to the UN Children's Fund, 16  African countries have attained a better standard of living for  their children than South Africa, the continent's most  prosperous country. Part of the solution lies in the provision  of more and better health services, particularly among the  neglected part of the population."" But this, together with ""the  provision of specialized treatment where necessary,"" is not the  whole solution. ""To improve the living standards of the  children, it is further necessary to persuade parents that  smaller families are in everyone's interests.... The legitimacy  of the new government offers it a golden opportunity to tackle  this sensitive issue.""     "
0,FT934-10289 ,"FT934-10289 _AN-DKGAGAAJFT 931106   FT  06 NOV 93 / UB Plasma scandal seen as 'isolated aberration'      By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor   'BLOOD and the products made from it can never be completely safe,' says Dr Harold Gunson, medical director of the UK National Blood Authority. 'The nature of blood means that it may carry infections.' Yet Dr Gunson and his European colleagues who are responsible for the safety of blood supplies insist the risk of infection from a contaminated product is less now than it has ever been. They regard Germany's UB Plasma scandal as an isolated aberration. The European blood industry, which has an estimated turnover of Pounds 1.5bn a year, is a complicated mixture of private, public and charitable enterprises. The UK, France, Belgium and Netherlands have relatively centralised collection systems, run by the state or the Red Cross. They rely on volunteers to give blood or plasma (the protein-rich liquid in which blood cells float). In the fragmented German system, however, state agencies, the Red Cross and companies such as UB Plasma all collect from paid donors. A German typically receives DM35 (Pounds 14.20) per donation. Some of the blood or plasma is used directly for transfusion and some is processed into a range of medicines such as factor VIII, immuno-globulins and albumin. For example, Immuno AG, an international pharmaceutical group based in Austria, incorporated material from UB Plasma in products sold in several European countries. These were withdrawn from sale yesterday. In the UK, the Medicines Control Agency told doctors that Immuno was recalling eight batches of immuno-globulin and albumin. 'This measure is purely precautionary and is to ensure total patient safety,' said Dr Kenneth Calman, the government's Chief Medical Officer. 'There is no evidence that HIV has been transmitted by these two products.' But Europe as a whole produces only half of the 6.3m litres of plasma it consumes each year. Most of the remainder is imported at a cost of Dollars 650m (Pounds 430m) a year from the US, where it comes from paid donors. The EC has been committed since 1989 to eventual 'self-sufficiency through voluntary unpaid donations', on the grounds that volunteers are less likely to be infected with organisms such as HIV, the Aids virus. Although little has been done yet to implement the policy, the EC is under pressure from the European Parliament to take stronger action to boost local production and phase out imports The commercial sector is lobbying strongly against import restrictions. It says regulations imposed by the Food and Drug Administration mean that procedures for screening donors and eliminating infection from plasma are superior in the US. But, in principle, all industrialised countries now maintain similar safety precautions for blood products. The first barrier is to make sure that donors - whether paid or not - have neither a medical history nor a lifestyle associated with high risk of infection. Questionnaires and interviews are designed to exclude drug addicts and homosexuals. Then the fresh plasma or blood is tested for syphilis, hepatitis B and C, and HIV. These tests are not infallible. Dr Gunson estimates that there is about a 'one in a million' chance that HIV will escape detection in any given donation; there is a period of several weeks after an individual has been infected with HIV, during which the antibody tests used for the virus give a negative result. Since HIV testing started in 1985, there has been only one known case of contamination in the UK. It resulted in two Scottish patients becoming infected with HIV. If the plasma is processed into medicines, further safety precautions are taken, including 'pasteurisation'. But Dr Robert Westphal, medical adviser to the International Federation of Red Cross Societies in Geneva, says viruses occasionally slip through even the current pasteurisation techniques. He worries too about new unknown viruses. 'Remember the early 1980s, when we didn't know that Aids was caused by the HIV,' Dr Westphal warns. 'What's out there now?' In the long term, the only way of guaranteeing that blood products are free of contamination will be to make them artificially from non-human ingredients. That will not happen on a large scale until well into the next century.   Companies:-  UB Plasma.   Countries:-  XGZ  Europe.     DEZ  Germany, EC.     QRZ  European Economic Community (EC).

Kono told reporters Hosokawa must take responsibility for  the scandal, which has brought to a deadlock Diet deliberations  on the 73.08 trillion yen state budget for fiscal 1994 which  starts April 1.    The LDP has demanded that Hosokawa submit further detailed  documents related to a 1982 loan of 100 million yen from Sagawa  Kyubin Co., the country's leading parcel delivery firm, saying  materials Hosokawa offered are insufficient to clear suspicions  over the loan. The opposition has also demanded that Hosokawa's  former secretary testify before the Diet on the loan issue.    The premier has said he borrowed the money to buy a  condominium in Tokyo and repair his home in Kumamoto Prefecture,  and he repaid the loan by January 31, 1991. He has reiterated  there were no illegalities in the loan.    Hosokawa last December submitted a memo to the opposition in  an attempt to clear his name.    The Sagawa Kyubin group was embroiled in a money scandal  involving a number of leading political figures, including  fallen LDP kingpin Shin Kanemaru, who was charged with tax  evasion last March.

He said yesterday he had a 'responsibility' to support the prime minister and party president. But Mr Kanemaru, 77, has taken two months to accept Mr Miyazawa's invitation to take the number two position. Some of Mr Kanemaru's colleagues had advised him not to be too closely associated with a prime minister whose reign could be short. Mr Miyazawa is generally thought to have made a poor start as prime minister, having failed to win parliamentary approval for a bill authorising Japanese troops to take part in UN peace-keeping operations. He has also been hurt by a fresh scandal involving alleged donations to a senior member of his own faction.

The new regulations require all blood products, which by law must be tested against the HIV virus that causes the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (Aids), to be re-examined before they are put on the market. The Paul-Erhrlich Institut, which conducts similar procedures for serum and vaccines, is expected to be given responsibility for the new controls, which will include detailed lists of all involved in the preparation of these products. The regulations include a four to six months quarantine for blood products as the HIV virus may be present but too young to be detected. They will come into force on January 1. Mr Seehofer also announced that the federal state will create a DM20m (Pounds 8m) fund to compensate AIDS victims who acquire the HIV virus through a blood transfusion. The German Red Cross said yesterday it would give an additional DM3m to the national Aids foundation. The new measures follow allegations last month that UB Plasma, a Koblenz company, had sold blood products containing the HIV virus.

Despite his public disapproval of the cult of personality, Deng Xiaoping, China's paramount leader, has allowed the Chinese taboo against publishing an account of the life of someone still alive to be infringed with the publication of his biography. Written by his daughter, Deng Rong, it is now being serialised in mass-circulation Chinese newspapers. But Rong's rose-coloured prose allows for no hint of scandal in her beloved father's life. She provides some details of his student days in France - where he developed decidedly bourgeois tastes for wine, cheese, coffee, bridge and his life-long interest in soccer - and in Moscow. Deng had three wives; the first died in childbirth in 1930, the second left him after a political disagreement in 1933, and the third, whom he married in 1939, produced five children. Rong is the youngest. Having just turned 89, his 'meeting with Karl Marx' cannot be far off; the tone of the book suggests that Deng is moving from the realm of earthly being towards communist sainthood.

However, Justice Augusto Belluscio, one of the two judges involved, plans to sue Mr Cavallo - who last week accused him of corruption - for slander. The justice has called on four of his eight colleagues to resign so as to restore the Supreme Court's political independence. A judge at a lower level has begun to investigate the allegations by Justice Belluscio that first gave rise to the mud-slinging, namely that he and his supreme court colleague, Justice Enrique Petracchi, claimed that pro-government colleagues had attempted to suppress a judgment which could have cost the central bank anywhere between Dollars 12m (Pounds 7.95m) and Dollars 2bn. Mr Cavallo then claimed that the two judges had tried to use the scandal to damage the government in the approach to congressional elections last Sunday, when the ruling Peronist party achieved considerable gains.

""What is required, he says, is a final  and clear statement on the organisation's economic policies.  Many of South Africa's older citizens would also like the ANC's  comment on disturbing speculation that a new government will  scrap a major tax concession on retirement annuities. Stals is  right: uncertainty is contributing to the flood, and the ANC  should speak loud and clear before it is too late.""    BUSINESS DAY    ANC Policy Contribution to Balance of Payments Exaggerated  --  Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 25 January in a page 8  editorial notes that Reserve Bank Governor Chris Stals ""blamed  uncertainty over the ANC's economic policy for most of the  R[rand]10bn [billion] outflow"" in the second half of 1993.  According to Stals the ""pre-election ANC ambiguity could worsen  the haemorrhage on the capital account of the balance of  payments. But Stals is probably exaggerating the contribution  of ANC economic policy -- or lack of it -- to balance of  payments problems."" ""Most foreign banks do not want to make  commitments beyond April,"" but the reason for that ""probably has  more to do with political stability than with ANC economic  policy."" So the ANC will be careful about responding to Stals's  call for a clearer ANC economic policy, ""as it balances the risk  of losing votes with the knowledge that no major turnaround in  the balance of payments can be expected until after the  election. It should nevertheless place more emphasis on its  commitment to financial discipline.""    SOWETAN    S. Africa Able To Influence Events in Lesotho -- South  African Foreign Minister Pik Botha's ""smugness over what is  happening in Lesotho is discomforting,"" declares a page 8  editorial in Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 25 January.  ""South Africa was involved in the various military governments  that have affected that kingdom's fortunes. There is no doubt  that South Africa is able to influence events in Lesotho in  various ways. It can close the border gates and, at best, can  send in armed forces to help Mokhehle. There is no need for  Botha to be so smarmy about the misfortunes currently befalling  this unhappy country.""    Furore Over 'Communists' on ANC Election List -- A second  editorial on the same page says the ""furore over the number of  SACP [South African Communist Party] members in the ANC's  parliamentary list is amusing but shows the hard ball that will  be played in events running up to the elections."" In the  election fight the ANC's opponents will ""deliberately forget or  ignore the fact that the link with the SACP goes back many  years. There will be an attempt to use the communist bogeyman  to scare white voters from the organisation. And while all this  is quite silly, it will be the way in which the elections are to  be fought.""    BEELD    Zulu Leaders Must Reconsider Boycott Strategy --  Johannesburg  BEELD in Afrikaans on 18 January says in a page 8 editorial:  ""When King Goodwill Zwelithini and Chief Minister Mangosuthu  Buthelezi began to beat the ethnic drums last year over the  so-called elimination of the Zulus, BEELD warned that fires were  being fanned which could be difficult to douse."" ""The stayaway  action which was planned as a show of strength to coincide with  the king's meeting with the state president was purportedly not  arranged by Mr. Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom Party, but that is  purely academic. The IFP leader, who has always strongly  opposed any stayaways and consumer boycotts by the ANC and its  allies on account of the economic disruption caused, this time  gloated over the Zulu nationalists' actions. The fires which  have been fanned for the past months flared dangerously on the  Reef in the form of vehicle hijackings, intimidation, arson,  violence, and even loss of life. These actions by the followers  of the two leaders will not promote their cause or win them new  friends in the black community or even among moderate whites.  The politically 'neutral' Zulu monarch has now been dumped  knee-deep in the political arena -- a step he might regret.  There is an urgent need for the two leaders to think seriously  about their boycott strategy. It is based on incorrect facts  and misconceptions and is being spurred on by misplaced  political ambitions.""    Dialogue Needed on ANC Reconstruction Plan -- A second  editorial on page 8 points out: ""There is no doubt that the  ANC's plan for economic and social reconstruction has  fundamental shortcomings. The question is, what must be done to  ensure a better and more workable plan?"" BEELD concludes: ""We  firmly believe there is a growing number of white South Africans  who accept the realities of their fatherland, and understand  that they will be asked to make sacrifices. But then the  demands made on them must be realistic and fair, and above all  must not be perceived as punishment. If the ANC takes note of  that, the basis will be laid for a sober debate on an explosive  issue.""    `Limited Violence' Not Easily Controlled -- General Constand  Viljoen, chairman of the Afrikaner National Front, AVF, speaks  of 'limited violence' to achieve the Afrikaner homeland. He  might believe he can keep it limited, but I am not so certain,""  argues Willie Kuhn in his ""Political BEELD"" column on page 10 of  the Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans on 21 January. ""One example  suffices: It appears that there is an onslaught on members and  property of the ANC in the Orange Free State. One cannot be  sure who is responsible, but it would be surprising if it were  not the right wing. Let's assume this pattern continues. Does  Gen. Viljoen believe there will be no reaction? We will then be  back in the eighties; violence begets violence.""    Mandela Outbursts Against De Klerk `Inopportune' --  Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans on 21 January in a page 10  editorial criticizes Mandela's ""two-facedness"". ""Mr. Mandela  accuses President de Klerk of orchestrating violence in the  townships with the aim of stopping the ANC from winning the  April elections."" BEELD questions why Mandela resorts to this  when he and De Klerk are presently engaged in talks to try and  find a solution to the violence in black townships. ""Or does he  want to wreck this peace plan for the townships?"" One can  understand that the ANC, co-responsible for ""the bloody  political battle in black townships,"" is eager to win the  election, but then one at least expects a future state president  to be more careful when talking about the present head of state.  His unproven allegations are not promoting the political climate  and feeds the general idea that ""what he says today contradicts  what he says the following day."" This will affect his  credibility.    ""The first welcome fruits of joint control over the security  forces are being reaped,"" notes a second editorial on the same  page. ""The ANC's announcement that a campaign is to be launched  in unrest areas on the East Rand to 'educate' residents to  accept the police and Defense Force and to stop attacks on them,  is a direct result of the extensive democratization process  currently underway in the country."" ""The sooner other  organizations copy this example, the quicker the quality of life  will improve for all South Africans."" The ANC should, however,  refrain from creating the perception that the security forces  are an extension of any particular political grouping, for this  will only exacerbate existing problems. ""Ultimately, it is the  community in general that must make the security forces feel  welcome.""     "

By August 1989 the US branch had made unauthorised loans totalling Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.2bn) to Baghdad. The report quoted former Iraqi foreign minister Tariq Aziz as saying one reason Baghdad invaded Kuwait in August 1990 was that the loans on which Iraq depended, through BNL's Atlanta branch, had dried up a year before. The 84-page report said it was clear the US branch of the Italian bank had played a key role in an American-led campaign to help Iraq defeat Iran in their 1980-87 war. 'A large part of the financial resources - which were managed by the United States - came from BNL,' it said. The report was adopted by a committee of inquiry set up by the Senate (upper house). The committee blamed BNL Atlanta's auditors for failing to detect any wrongdoing and said the Georgia State Banking Department was also at fault, as well as the Federal Reserve, the US central bank. But it ruled out the possibility that the Atlanta branch manager had acted alone and strongly criticised BNL's management.  The Financial Times   London Page 3  "

Those charged include police Lt Gen Chalor Kerdthet, who first headed the investigation into the theft of gems from a Saudi Arabian palace in 1989, and four other policemen. Gen Chalor has already been accused of embezzling some of the jewels. Thailand's Office of the Attorney General dropped plans to charge two other police generals of involvement in the murder. The case has aroused intense interest in Thailand because of growing frustration with corruption in the country's police force. At least 10 people are believed to have been murdered in connection with the case. Angered by the slow pace of the investigation, Saudi Arabia has refused to grant new visas to Thai migrant workers and stopped Saudi tourists from visiting Thailand. The Thai gardener who stole the jewels in Saudi Arabia was arrested after his return to Thailand, but the gems returned by the police to the Saudi prince turned out to be fakes copied from the originals. Most of the real gems are still missing.   Countries:-  THZ  Thailand, Asia.   Industries:-  P9221 Police Protection.   Types:-  NEWS  General News.  The Financial Times   London Page 6  "

He was replaced by Mr Loukas Papademos, the deputy governor. Mr Papademos said the change would not affect the bank's tight monetary policy, aimed at cutting inflation from 11.9 per cent to single digits next year. The bank's exchange rate policy, based on a 'hard drachma' which has slipped only 6-7 per cent this year against other European currencies, will also be maintained. Mr Boutos, appointed governor 11 months ago by Socialist prime minister Andreas Papandreou, said he resigned 'over a question of principle' but gave no details. Banking sources said he was under pressure to reinstate the commissioner, Mr Kostas Kalivianakis, who has close links with senior Socialist officials. The Bank of Crete was placed under central bank supervision in 1989 following a Dollars 200m (Pounds 126.5m) embezzlement scandal involving its owner, Mr George Koskotas, now in jail for fraud. The central bank planned to put Bank of Crete on sale this year. Informal discussions had already taken place with ETEVA, a state-owned development bank keen to expand into commercial banking.

The fact that, within days of its decision, KCET management folded  under threats from L.A. city councilmen, self-appointed media vigilantes and  ""community activists,"" reversing a programming decision that took a year to  make -- a feat beyond the wildest dreams of Jesse Helms and his watchdog  minions?    No, for Rosenberg this frighteningly effective intrusion of the political left  into the area of programming is neither shocking nor a threat to the integrity  of public broadcasting. That is because Rosenberg agrees with the vigilantes.  Therefore, what in other cases he would see as political interference with  artistic freedom, in this case he regards as simple justice.    What is shocking for Rosenberg is that KCET should have even considered  removing such an embarrassing, low-grade propaganda effort masquerading as a  ""news"" program in the first place.    And why would KCET management have done such a thing? Might they have concluded  that the producers of ""South Africa Now"" were little more than ""solidarity with  the ANC"" committeemen and that for KCET to air ideological claptrap from the  left might be a disservice not only to their viewing public, but even to black  South Africans struggling to free themselves from the shackles of apartheid?    No, in the politically jaundiced eyes of Rosenberg, such considerations can  only be smoke screens. Only sinister pressure from right-wing apologists for  the apartheid state could have prompted such a decision. For, in Rosenberg's  view, ""South Africa Now"" is irreplaceable: ""Unlike the preponderance of  reporting on the region, (""South Africa Now"") views not only the nation of  South Africa, but also the whole of Southern Africa through black eyes.""    All blacks see alike, and in particular see like the ANC. This is the  patronizing attitude that passes for moral wisdom on the left. Of course, like  everybody else, Rosenberg has heard that there is a fratricidal conflict going  on between blacks in South Africa that has taken nearly a thousand lives since  Nelson Mandela was freed. But the ANC party-liners, who produce ""South Africa  Now,"" have assured us that this violence is due to the manipulations of  ""security police and right-wing death squads,"" while Rosenberg ludicrously  suggests that it is charges like these that may have been ""too bold"" for KCET!    As it happens, only a few days ago I was sitting in a cafe in Johannesburg with  four members of the executive committee of the Pan African Congress (PAC),  including Philemon Tefo who was imprisoned with Mandela in Robben Island for 27  years for his efforts to overthrow the apartheid regime.    Tefo was complaining about the ANC's current negotiations with the deKlerk  government, which the PAC opposes. He said: ""If it's the ANC and Inkatha, it's  the ANC and AZAPO (Steve Biko's organization) it's killing. But if it's the ANC  and the government, it's kissing."" Nor was Philemon Tefo the only black  anti-apartheid activist who complained to me about the ANC's hit men while I  was there (there is even a name for them -- ""comtsotsis,"" a contraction for  ""communist thugs""). Clearly there are more things in South Africa's heaven and  earth than are dreamt of in the left-wing philosophies of Howard Rosenberg and  the producers of ""South Africa Now.""    The Committee on Media Integrity has no interest in censoring programs on KCET,  although it reserves the right to judge them on their merits. (For the record:  there was no pressure from our organization on KCET -- not even a ""letter  writing campaign."" There was just civilized dialogue between us and KCET  management.) The Committee on Media Integrity is an organization that seeks to  promote balance in public television by adding voices that are not now heard.  For example, in the area of current affairs documentaries, KCET, in our view,  has veered far to the left, to the exclusion of other perspectives.    Part of the problem we have experienced in attempting to redress this imbalance  at KCET lies with the only true watchdog of the media in Los Angeles, the  Calendar section of The Times itself. Its chief television critic, Howard  Rosenberg, is an articulate champion of the cultural left. But that makes him a  poor arbiter and/or defender of cultural integrity.    Perhaps the most significant step that could be taken to improve the quality of  public television, would be for The Times to balance Rosenberg with a less  ideologically committed television critic.

As it happens, only a few days ago I was sitting in a cafe in Johannesburg with  four members of the executive committee of the Pan African Congress (PAC),  including Philemon Tefo who was imprisoned with Mandela in Robben Island for 27  years for his efforts to overthrow the apartheid regime.    Tefo was complaining about the ANC's current negotiations with the deKlerk  government, which the PAC opposes. He said: ""If it's the ANC and Inkatha, it's  the ANC and AZAPO (Steve Biko's organization) it's killing. But if it's the ANC  and the government, it's kissing."" Nor was Philemon Tefo the only black  anti-apartheid activist who complained to me about the ANC's hit men while I  was there (there is even a name for them -- ""comtsotsis,"" a contraction for  ""communist thugs""). Clearly there are more things in South Africa's heaven and  earth than are dreamt of in the left-wing philosophies of Howard Rosenberg and  the producers of ""South Africa Now.""    The Committee on Media Integrity has no interest in censoring programs on KCET,  although it reserves the right to judge them on their merits. (For the record:  there was no pressure from our organization on KCET -- not even a ""letter  writing campaign."" There was just civilized dialogue between us and KCET  management.) The Committee on Media Integrity is an organization that seeks to  promote balance in public television by adding voices that are not now heard.  For example, in the area of current affairs documentaries, KCET, in our view,  has veered far to the left, to the exclusion of other perspectives.    Part of the problem we have experienced in attempting to redress this imbalance  at KCET lies with the only true watchdog of the media in Los Angeles, the  Calendar section of The Times itself. Its chief television critic, Howard  Rosenberg, is an articulate champion of the cultural left. But that makes him a  poor arbiter and/or defender of cultural integrity.    Perhaps the most significant step that could be taken to improve the quality of  public television, would be for The Times to balance Rosenberg with a less  ideologically committed television critic.

Expelled before competing were Jason Livingston, 21, a 100m runner, and weightlifters Andrew Saxton, above, and Andrew Davies, both 25. The drugs tests were conducted in the UK earlier this month, with the results made public yesterday. Livingston tested positive for the anabolic steroid Methandianone. He is known as 'Baby Ben' because of his resemblance to his hero, Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson, who was stripped of the 100m Olympic gold medal at Seoul four years ago after failing a drug test. Davies and Saxton, shown yesterday after returning to his home at Cowley, Oxford, gave test samples containing Clenbuterol, a banned stimulant. Saxton protested his innocence. UK sports minister Robert Key promised there would be 'no hiding place' for cheats. Olympics reports, Page 12  The Financial Times   London Page 1  "
0,FT932-3842 ,"FT932-3842 _AN-DFKB5AGZFT 930611   FT  11 JUN 93 / Survey of South Africa (1): Yearning for stability - After nearly four years of upheaval, South Africa desperately needs a political settlement. Both Nelson Mandela and President FW de Klerk are determined to deliver a negotiated government of national unity. But time is running out      By PATTI WALDMEIR   THE centre holds. It held when South Africa faced the biggest political crisis of the post-apartheid era, the assassination of African National Congress leader Chris Hani. It held when the butchers of Boipatong and Bisho cut down innocent blacks. It held when black hands murdered white farmers. Over the past year, the centre has held against all the odds, against every threat from right or left. And it holds still. For a country divided by history and design, with one of the world's highest rates of crime, political violence, unemployment and poverty, that is something of a miracle. Over the next year, there is every chance that the centre will grow stronger still - if only because the spectre of racist radicals to left and right will frighten the ANC and the ruling National Party into an ever-tighter embrace. Weakness has always been the cement which bound their reluctant alliance - each knew it could not survive without the other - and that bond can only grow as inevitable defections to hard-line black and white parties (such as the black supremacist Pan Africanist Congress and the Afrikaner nationalist Conservative Party) render each weaker still. But within that centre ground, the most momentous shifts are taking place: for sometime over the Easter weekend - the fateful weekend of the Hani assassination - the National Party passed an historic point of no return. The balance of power - still nominally Pretoria's, with its control of the security forces, the administration and the fiscal purse-strings - began to tilt in favour of those who must eventually take over as the dominant force, the ANC. President FW de Klerk, with all his police and soldiers, had no choice but to hand over responsibility for law and order to ANC president Nelson Mandela. Mr Mandela - not Mr de Klerk - issued a televised appeal for calm, in tacit admission that only he could prevent the threatened descent into chaos. Mr de Klerk controlled the state; but Mr Mandela controlled the nation. Since then, President de Klerk has done all he can to restore the credibility lost during that period, when National Party supporters finally faced the inevitable: the loss of monopoly white power, and the spectre of black rule. He has ostentatiously wielded the levers of power - rejecting, to ANC howls of outrage, an independently-chosen board of governors for the state-owned South African Broadcasting Corporation - and insisting (as he does elsewhere in this survey) that the hand of a National Party leader will remain on the tiller for the foreseeable future. But many of his supporters - and a substantial section of his caucus - seem to have lost faith in these assurances. White morale has never been so low, generating a boom for international removals companies. According to the most recent opinion poll, National Party support among whites has fallen below 25 per cent for the first time. This may not be good news for South African democracy. For Mr de Klerk's mission has ever been to ensure that moderate forces - led by him, and including the Afrikaner nation which he alone can protect - can prevent a black government from ruling unchecked. If he thinks this goal is threatened, he is likely to harden his bottom line. He has made clear his demands: the National Party will require what amounts to a veto over cabinet decisions on fundamental issues - until at least the end of the century, perhaps beyond. ANC leaders reject this, though they have conceded the first post-election cabinet will include all leaders with more than 5 per cent of the popular vote (with cabinet posts distributed proportionately) and that Mr de Klerk will have what amounts to a veto over a very limited number of issues. They have also conceded that significant powers be devolved from central to regional governments - another check on ANC domination, demanded by Mr de Klerk - but the detailed distribution has yet to be agreed. In narrowing the gaps on these issues, Messrs de Klerk and Mandela will finally answer the question they have so long avoided: who will wield real power in the new South Africa? The answer seems obvious: the ANC and the National Party together - but not necessarily under conditions of true democracy. First prize remains a government of national unity ruling under a negotiated multiracial constitution, with maximum popular legitimacy. But stability - however it is achieved - is a close second, and gaining. After nearly four years of political upheaval, South Africa yearns for stability: without it, the economy cannot recover from its four-year recession; schools will remain in chaos; the water will not run and the toilets will not work in the townships; crime cannot be contained. And South Africa risks losing the skilled people who alone can prevent it, in the words of one leading Afrikaner, from 'sliding into Africa'. Both the ANC and the National Party are determined to deliver stability. For the moment, they are still striving for first prize, a negotiated government of national unity, ruling under a more or less liberal constitution. They may well get the first instalment of that prize soon: a 26-party transitional executive council with narrow authority to oversee government in the run-up to elections tentatively set for April 27 next year. But it falls far short of the constitutional deal which must be agreed by September if elections are to be held in April. The game plan is for the ANC and government to force through the 26-party constitutional negotiating forum their own outline agreement on a new constitution, which calls for a five-year multiracial power-sharing cabinet, proportional representation, a bill of rights, and substantial devolution of power to regions. Their dual challenge is to finalise their own agreement on power-sharing (which could prove more difficult than anticipated, if Mr de Klerk is serious about a permanent arrangement) while trying to drag other parties into the deal. Their goal is to ensure that those who could do most to sabotage elections and destabilise a new government - the mainly Zulu Inkatha Freedom Party, the black-radical Pan Africanist Congress, the right-wing Conservative Party and the moderate-right Afrikaner Volksunie - will give a new constitution their blessing. They may soon conclude that is an impossible task. So far, they have kept all parties at the table primarily by skirting important issues; but time has run out on such leisurely tactics. Before September, they must agree an interim constitution under which to hold elections; settle a host of problems such as the powers of the transitional executive, and of independent commissions to oversee elections and the state broadcast media; resolve the issue of joint control of the security forces and political armies; and agree the principles by which writers of a final constitution will be bound. This list goes on and on. Negotiators from both sides make clear that a deal will be pushed through, no matter who disagrees (Inkatha's broadly constructive attitude at the talks suggests Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi has accepted that reality). Legitimacy will be guaranteed either by free and fair elections (a long shot, given the present violence), by a popular referendum - or not at all. Dissent will be dealt with either within the constitution, or outside it, but it will be dealt with. It would be a shame if South Africa ends up with no more than - in the words of ANC constitutional expert Albie Sachs - 'deracialised oppression'. But if the choice is between peace, stability and economic growth on the one side - and democracy on the other - South Africa may yet decide democracy is a luxury it cannot afford.

And of course I  find it amusing (to be Minister of Home Affairs) in view of the  fact that the former government took away my passport for nine  years and I am now in charge of the passports!    On the question of immigration:    [Buthelezi] The second challenge (to the portfolio) is that  it has immigration as one of its segments ... in the past there  was discrimination...people from Europe were allowed to come  here more easily than black people from other countries. Now  already there are Africans from some of the southern African  countries or even from central Africa coming in here in the hope  of getting a job. How does one deal with that? The handling  seems to me to be a very sensitive thing because the needs of  South Africans are so vast...charity begins at home, while (at  the same time Africans) are our brothers and sisters. Last week  I had lunch with bankers from Switzerland, and one said he had  never heard so much French spoken in South Africa. That really  indicates what is going on now.    On his experience with the new Cabinet:    [Buthelezi] I find that the cordiality (among) all of us is  really quite something because, to be quite honest, I sit there  facing some people who have really been vilifying me -- but I  have no animosity towards them and we joke. From that point of  view I think it is some kind of a miracle, really.    On the Reconstruction and Development Programme [RDP]:    [Buthelezi] I think it (the RDP) is one of the best (pieces  of) writing I have ever seen. On the face of it, it has many  platitudes which no one would have any problem about. And also  as far as our economic policy is concerned there are many things  (in the RDP) which are the same. But my worry is: can one  deliver from the point of view of the fiscus? I have expressed  this concern in Cabinet, because the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party]  does not like too much intervention by the State in the economy.  But we are doing the best (we can) together, we are  co-operating. We'll try to do the best to deliver in terms of  it.    On the RDP and the Province:    [Buthelezi] Responding to the President's speech I did state  my own feeling about deliver -- that unless these things are  delivered on the ground, and they can only be delivered on the  ground by the provinces, (not much will be accomplished).  That's why I have been fighting all along for the autonomy of  provinces.    On the Melamet Commission's recommendations:    [Buthelezi] From the point of view of our people, black  people, I would say that they (the salaries) are too high.  (But) most of the perks are now no longer there. There used to  be a lot of perks for other Ministers.    On the transfer of land to the Ingonyama Trust:    [Buthelezi] The issue that I thought might ruin the  Government of National Unity [GNU] was this thing of the  Ingonyama Land Trust. But the way it was handled by President  Mandela himself, and also by Minister Derek Hanekom and those  other colleagues who were in that (Cabinet) committee was such  that, really, I was pleasantly surprised. Because it seemed to  me that they went out of their way to ensure that it didn't  ruin the GNU.    On whether IFP structures continue to function:    [Buthelezi] There is the issue of local elections, and I  don't think we should be caught flat-footed if and when that  comes. So, in fact, when I was addressing a victory rally in  Umlazi last weekend I stressed that we need to put our  structures in order. I was very unhappy with our structures.    On mediation:    [Buthelezi] Well, there are some very good things in it (the  Interim Constitution), but I still say it is a flawed  constitution. And I'm still very concerned that the agreement,  on the basis of which I went into the election be implemented --  that immediately afterwards there should be international  mediation on the issue of the king and the kingdom. One must  set that ball rolling because I think that once the  Constitutional Assembly starts moving it would be impossible to  then have international mediation. We most definitely still  want that mediation.    I think, for instance, in terms of the RDP, I cannot see  that  we can deliver on the ground if we are as centrist as the  constitution is at present. So, I would really want that  changed in the constitution. And I was not quite happy with the  way (legislation on the Constitutional Court was (handled). I  rally do believe that if we want to deliver, it is really  essential (that we have true federalism). And I was very  interested in the meeting that Mr Mandela asked me to attend  with premiers, because I could see that the very bright people  who are premiers all over the place want to get on with the job  with the job to deliver. And that means power. It means  regional powers. One of them (ANC premiers) even joked with me  and said: ""Why did you fight this issue alone for so long?""    On the election atmosphere:    [Buthelezi] In fact, it was a miracle. People queued up  together, whether they were ANC, IFP, PAC [Pan Africanist  Congress] or anything, and there was no animosity or anyone  taunting anyone else. It was extraordinary, and I was  pleasantly surprised.    On violence levels now:    [Buthelezi] Unfortunately, even if the media does not  highlight it, there is a lot of political killing going on even  ow. In fact, last weekend one of my first cousins was burying  his son in Mandeni, and I know of quite a number of people who  have died since the election, some of them prominent leaders of  the IFP.    On what can be done to finally eradicate violence:    [Buthelezi] I said (in a recent speech) that it is wonderful  we have got our liberation, but I (also) said there is a dark  cloud because the state of emergency is still on the  KwaZulu/Natal, and I resent that very much because I didn't  think that it should have been imposed.    On whether he has raised the issue with Mandela:    [Buthelezi] Let me share with you an informal conversation  we  had with him. In Parliament we were standing in the Assembly  with some of my colleagues, and he came over to our side. One  of our leaders raised this issue, and he (Mandela) said: ""No,  no, no, that we will discuss with Shenge [Buthelezi's tribal  name]."" He said it was a matter between us. But, of course, I  don't blame President Mandela that he hasn't (yet) done so. He  is a very busy person.    On his relationship with Mandela:    [Buthelezi] President Mandela has always been very affable.  I defer to Madiba [Mandela] (because he is older than me). He  has said things which have hurt me, but I have never responded  in kind because for me, even before he was President, he is  still mnewethu [my brother], he is older than me and I respect  that. In spite of all those things that have hurt me, when we  are together this warmth surfaces.    On his relationship with F W de Kerk:    [Buthelezi] I wouldn't say that we are close, but I think we  behave towards each other like civilized men, if I may put it  that way.    On the possibility of a future IFP/NP [National Party]  alliance:    [Buthelezi] Well, I haven't thought of that. The betrayal  (by De Klerk and his government) came up on issues like  federation. He and his party say they also believe in a federal  formula for this country but in terms of delivery, when it came  to negotiating with the ANC on a trilateral basis, there was no  evidence of that. And that's what, really, brought about the  mistrust between us.    On pressure on him to enter the election:    [Buthelezi] My good friend, Chancellor (Helmut) Kohl invited  me to Germany. I have very high regard for Chancellor Kohl, and  after I had explained my position, he had no problem. But then  when I went to see his Minister of Foreign Affairs who belongs  to another party ... it was quite an acrimonious discussion, on  the basis that he was now seeing me as the fly in the ointment,  as the person who was blocking things from happening.    From there I went to Copenhagen, invited by the Foreign  Minister there, and it was the same kind of thing. And also my  last meeting with the Prime Minister of Britain, (John) Major,  wasn't very cordial. I didn't know him as well as Lady Thatcher  who really became a friend of mine. But I actually didn't blame  them myself. I blame the diplomats as a whole. In fact, the  American ambassador went out of his way to write me a very long  letter, which personally I wouldn't have thought an ambassador  should write.    On whether his international relations have improved:    [Buthelezi] It is still too early to judge, but there have  been a number of ambassadors who have come here paying respects  or just coming to see me in my new capacity.    On whether foreign pressure influenced him:    [Buthelezi] No. In fact, whenever there were those  discussions abroad, I always said to them: you don't have to  live with it, I have to live with it, which they didn't like  very much. I said that whereas I don't question the fact that  they have a right to advise and to help and so on, they are not  South Africans and in the final analysis I have to live with the  results of what they were asking me to do.    On when people's standard of living will improve:    [Buthelezi] You are asking a very painful question because I  don't believe that however much we try -- and it's wrong,  perhaps, for me as a Minister to say so -- but I don't think  that in terms of the promises of the election and the  expectations which have arisen as a result of those promises,  that we can deliver in terms of those promises. I hope it  doesn't create disillusionment.    On the possibility of an election before 1999:    [Buthelezi] I have said that people must prepare for an  election. If you look in the histories of many countries of  majority parties, when they cannot deliver sometimes they call  an election before there is too much disillusionment.    On the IFP's election performance:    [Buthelezi] If you look at the vote I had and, of course, if  you look at the malpractices as well which robbed us of many  votes, even I was surprised. Not that I didn't know that people  supported me. It was not even (only) in the so-called Zulu  areas that I got the vote, but in many parts of South Africa.  If I had campaigned, It seems that I have a right to say I  would have done very well. I don't say I would have been  elected as the government, but I would have done far better if I  had campaigned.    On allegations of tensions within the IFP:    [Buthelezi] It was a figment, really, of the imagination.  There was no such a thing at all. But I think that there were  some Members of Parliament that we had inherited that were keen  to maintain their careers, and they were the ones who were  feeding this to the press, (probably) to put pressure on me.    On criticism of IFP `hardliners':    [Buthelezi] Dr (Mario) Ambrosini even now is very close to  me, not because he gives me political advice at all, but because  of his expertise as an international constitutional lawyer. He  is a very clever and competent person in that field. Mr  (Walter) Felgate has worked with me for nearly 20 years now.  This (criticism) of course was also fed to the press by the  government itself. Also, it is a racist idea that if any white  person is close to you, then he is your adviser in a sense that  he is a guru to you. For an old man like myself who has been in  politics for more than 40 years, to say that either Felgate or  Ambrosini then became my gurus, really, is laughable to me.    On whether pre-election pressure on him took its toll on his  health:    [Buthelezi] I really don't know. My mother, who died at the  age of 84, had a very strong constitution. I only say, perhaps,  I must have inherited my mother's constitution. But many people  say I am abusing it because of the pace at which I work, and the  way I work until late at night. I think that the pressure I was  under was such that I even marvel myself when some of the  doctors examine me wand say how low my blood pressure is, how  normal it is.    On people's expectations:    [Buthelezi] I can only echo what President Mandela has said.  Our people, the South African nation, must really understand  that we do mean to deliver -- even those of us who are not  members of the ANC. We do mean to co-operate with the ANC in  the Government to deliver. But even he, President Mandela, has  said that these things can't be delivered instantly. One must  warn the nation that in terms of the vast needs, and the extent  to which the economy itself was damaged by disinvestment and  other things, people should just be a little patient with us.  They should not really look to the Government to do it (alone),  but to the Government to do it with them. I believe the twin  pillars are self-help and self-reliance.     "

As a result, the  reputation of the Conservative government is going downhill, and  the position of Prime Minister John Major is becoming more  precarious each day.    At the beginning of this year, British society was shocked  by  a scandal where Environment Minister Tim Yeo had an illegitimate  child. Because this minister had always been an advocate of  John Major's new idea of ""back to basics,"" the mass media raised  the issue: If it attached great importance to ""traditional  values,"" the Conservative Party should not act against family  and individual moral standards either. Facing a public outcry  for Yeo's resignation, Prime Minister John Major claimed that  ""the illegitimate child"" issue was a private matter for Yeo and  that it was up to him to decide whether he should resign from  office. John Major's remarks aroused greater resentment among  the public. As a result, Yeo's constituency demanded that he  resign immediately, while criticism from the media also  intensified.    The forced resignation of Tim Yeo was followed by another  scandal. Secretary to the Cabinet Alan Duncan went so far as to  buy a council house illegally for 50 percent less than the  market price, thus earning a profit of nearly 200,000 pounds.  Then, on 10 January, the Earl of Caithness, the minister of  state for transport, announced his resignation. It was  disclosed that the cause of his resignation was the suicide of  his wife, who could not bear the minister's extra-marital  affairs.    If we say that the disgraceful series above only impaired  the  reputation of individuals, then another scandal revealed by  major British newspapers the other day could do great harm to  the image of the Conservative Party as a whole.    According to a 250-page report released by the relevant  auditing department in London, Westminster City Council, which  is claimed to be the ""flagship"" council of the Conservative  Party in Greater London (and which includes major commercial and  tourist areas in London proper), had misappropriated up to 21.25  million pounds of public funds to canvass for the Conservative  Party. This incident immediately gave rise to a public uproar,  and some people believe that ""the Conservative Party is corrupt  and that they have abandoned basic traditional values.""    In recent years, Britain has been plagued by a worsening  economic recession and drastic increases in unemployment and  crime rates, and complaints are heard everywhere. People from  Britain's political and economic circles have always blamed the  leaders of the Conservative Party for ""their lack of creativity""  as well as their inability to shoulder the heavy duty of leading  Britain. Under such circumstances, in order to establish a new  image for and restore the prestige of the Conservative Party,  John Major raised the slogan of ""back to basics"" at the party's  annual conference in October 1993. The essence of his slogan was  to implement basic economic policies, including maintaining a  low inflation rate, advocating free markets, and supporting the  development of enterprises; attaching greater importance to  basic social values, such as exercising self restraint,  respecting the law, and showing concern for others; and to  restoring the traditional values of ""being honest and upright in  one's way, and being particular about one's manners."" For a  time, the public cherished the hope that Major's slogan could  inject a certain vigor into British society, which has been  dejected and apathetic for many years. That is why public  resentment is soaring after the moral scandals inside the  government were exposed, and people have deemed the Major  administration a ""hypocritical"" government. It is clear that  the accusations made in political circles and the media have  already gone beyond the moral standards of individuals and have  touched upon the credibility and reputation of the leaders of  the Conservative Party.    The results of the latest opinion polls show clearly that  the  Conservative Party has fallen behind the Labor Party by 25  percentage points, with an approval rate of a mere 26 percent.  People generally believe that the unceasing scandals in the  Conservative Party have made the Major administration, which  already suffers low prestige among the public, to further lose  the trust of the British public. It is probable that the Major  administration will choose to reshuffle the cabinet at an early  date; otherwise, it will surely suffer losses in the local  council elections and the European Parliament elections  scheduled for this May and June. By then, the problems may be  so serious that one or two resignations by ministers will be to  no avail.     "
0,FT921-11581 ,"FT921-11581 _AN-CA4AUAAAFT 920131   FT  31 JAN 92 / Luck finally runs out for the great survivor of Irish politics: A scandal too many led coalition partners to pull rug from under Haughey - The downfall of Ireland's prime minister      By TIM COONE   'LIKE HIM or loathe him, it was impossible to ignore him. Irish politics will certainly be duller without him as Taoiseach.' The 38-year political career of Mr Charles Haughey, 12 of them as leader of his Fianna Fail party and four times elected prime minister, was thus summed up yesterday by one of Mr Haughey's arch opponents, Mr Prionsias de Rossa, the leader of the Worker's Party. The 'great survivor' of the Irish political scene, a self-made man who seemed to thrive on controversy, Mr Haughey finally ran out of luck this week, when a telephone-tapping scandal from nine years ago came back to haunt him. A former justice minister, Mr Sean Doherty, told an astonished press conference last week, that Mr Haughey had been fully aware that two journalists' telephones had been illegally bugged in an attempt to trace cabinet leaks. Mr Haughey has always denied the allegations. But for the Progressive Democrats, the junior partners in his coalition, the truth of the allegations were no longer relevant. The government's credibility was at stake, and they demanded he resign or face an election. The incident was the culmination of a succession of scandals in which close associates of Mr Haughey became embroiled in property and share-deals involving state-run companies. Barely a week has gone by since last September, without Mr Haughey having to defend himself against vitriolic opposition attacks in the parliament over his alleged involvement. At one point, an opposition deputy described him as 'looking like a lawyer defending a poor brief'. Last week the Progressive Democrats decided they had had enough. Backbenchers and ministers in his party were equally nervous at the prospect of an early general election. In the five elections since Mr Haughey became party leader in 1979, an absolute parliamentary majority has eluded him, forcing him into coalitions with which he has never been really comfortable. Mr Des O'Malley, the Progressive Democrats leader, praised the 1992 budget presented on Wednesday by Mr Bertie Ahern, the finance minister. Mr Ahern is a strong candidate to succeed Mr Haughey, and whether he decides to challenge Mr Albert Reynolds, a former finance minister who is considered the strongest candidate, or to throw his support behind him, the future of the coalition is guaranteed. Like Mrs Thatcher, with whom Mr Haughey crossed swords in 1985 over the Anglo-Irish agreement (which he described as 'a sad day for Irish nationalism), he will not be a comfortable figure on the backbenches. Last year, following intense pressure to resign, he said 'growing roses is not the same as a political career'. He was even to adopt Thatcherite economic policies in the late-80s when he regained the premiership, admitting that borrowing and budget deficits 'make matters worse'. He hands on a financially-sound government. As a pragmatist rather than an ideologue he even came to accept the Anglo-Irish agreement as the framework for progress on Northern Ireland.

0,FT932-15113 ,"FT932-15113 _AN-DDOCIAC5FT 930415   FT  15 APR 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): The man who would make kings - A campaign to sell royalty to the Brazilians      By CHRISTINA LAMB   Helio Bloch is a kingmaker. Not, he hastens to explain, in the metaphorical sense used for US political consultants with presidents to sell, but with a real throne in his sights. Next Wednesday Brazilians will vote in a plebiscite on whether to restore the monarchy. Bloch, from the Rio-based Meet advertising agency, is in charge of mustering the support of those disenchanted with the 104-year-old republic. 'It's the first time this century that anyone has tried to sell a real king,' he says. The plebiscite, in which Brazilians must also vote on whether to change the current presidential system to a parliamentary model, is breathing life into Brazil's recession-hit advertising industry, with three leading agencies masterminding campaigns. Every night for the last two months monarchists, presidentialists and parliamentarians have been trying to sell their wares in a fixed 20-minute slot of free airtime to Brazil's 85m voters. The task for their creators is more challenging than most advertising campaigns, even of a political nature, because they are not marketing a product but a concept, one that is hard to grasp by a largely uneducated population. Bloch explains: 'This is very different to traditional political campaigns where one is simply selling a new face or new platform for a party already established in the public mind. In the UK, for example, John Major could be sold as the new face of Conservatism without having to explain what being a Conservative means. I'm having to sell a whole new idea.' Although latest polls show the monarchists registering only 17 per cent of the vote, Bloch is confident. His main selling point is the success of monarchy in modern world, using Spain and Japan as examples. Brazil's history also plays an important part in Bloch's attempts to 'establish the credentials of monarchy'. 'Brazilians have a very good image of the last Emperor Dom Pedro II,' he says. 'He paid his own bills, the country had total liberty of speech and was very advanced with amongst the world's first railways and telephone systems.' Bloch's third weapon is what he calls the 'collective subconscious'. He explains: 'Everything good in Brazil is royal, thus Pele is known as king of football, Roberto Carlos (a top singer) is the king of music and Xuxa (the leading children's presenter) is the queen of children.' With less than Dollars 1m (Pounds 662,000) at his disposal, Bloch elected to spend most of the money on short commercials, concentrating on these three points. Under the slogan 'Help Brazil recover its majesty', recurring themes in these commercials are the absence of inflation and corruption during Brazil's 67-year-period as a monarchy compared with today's rapid inflation and rampant bribery. Despite Bloch's well-acclaimed campaign, the republicans are far ahead. Surprisingly, support for presidentialism has not been dented by the corruption scandal which led to the impeachment of President Fernando Collor. Sergio Amado from Denison, the Sao Paulo-based agency running the campaign, uses the national anthem and footage of important mass protests of the past to come over as the more patriotic choice. He uses the Collor scandal as a benefit of the system: 'We decided we must confront the issue so we used the theme 'You the people elected him and you the people took him away'.' With more than Dollars 5m to spend, Amado hopes to get seven out of 10 votes, partly through attacks on the other systems, attacking the monarchy for slavery and blaming the disastrous experience of parliamentarianism in 1962-63 - when the country had three prime ministers in one year - for the subsequent military coup. The big loser is parliamentarianism with a didactic campaign involving too many talking heads trying to explain the concept of parliamentarism and division of powers to a largely illiterate population. So desperate are the parliamentarians that they are offering voters the chance of another referendum after five years.   Countries:-  BRZ  Brazil, South America.

By MARIA NEWMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER      ORANGE      The lingering effects of a years-old kickback scandal and divisive labor  disputes have made the Orange Unified School District board race the most  crowded and controversial of the eight school contests on the Nov. 7 ballot.    Plagued by the scandal and a seven-day teachers' strike last spring, the first  in the county in three years, the district also has had more recent problems.  Board members were accused of making a controversial school-boundary change out  of the public eye by traveling to Palm Springs in August and making the  decision there.    This tumultuous atmosphere has resulted in 19 candidates vying for four  single-district seats and an unexpired term in a fifth area.    The three incumbents seeking reelection to the seven-member board have  struggled to get out from under the shadow of Orange County's biggest school  scandal in a decade. One of them, county General Services Agency supervisor Joe  J. Cherry, could face a new trial on charges in connection with the kickback  scandal that rocked the district more than three years ago.    Critics say that by running again, Cherry is prolonging the district's  inability to move beyond its infamy. Cherry, however, says he's running partly  to vindicate himself.    Six candidates have filed to run against him in Area 5, the highest number of  challengers in any of the Orange Unified races.    ""The shadow is not only over the board, but it's all over the whole district,""  said Kevin Rice, a businessman who is seeking election to another vacant seat.    The other two trustees implicated in the matter, Ruth C. Evans, who has served  20 years on the board, and Robert James Elliott, who has served for 25 years,  are not seeking reelection.    The three were accused by the 1986-87 Orange County Grand Jury of ""willful  misconduct in office"" for allegedly not minding the store while thousands of  dollars in kickback contracts were negotiated from the district's headquarters.    The other two incumbents seeking reelection besides Cherry, board President  Sandy Englander and trustee Jane McCracken, have consistently reminded voters  that they were not on the board when the alleged incidents of mismanagement  occurred.    McCracken was named to the board in February to fill a vacancy when member  William Steiner was appointed to the Orange City Council. By law, the district  must put his position on the ballot even though there are only two years left  in Steiner's four-year term.    The district has more than 25,000 students and includes the cities of Orange  and Villa Park, and portions of Anaheim, Garden Grove and Santa Ana.    The campaign has been marked by high spending -- some candidates say they are  spending as much as $20,000 -- political consultants advising the candidates  and a variety of forums in which district employees have tried to challenge  incumbents on the issues.    Earlier this month, about 80% of the district's 1,200 non-teaching employees  staged a sickout to protest a breakdown in wage negotiations. An agreement has  yet to be reached in that matter. On Thursday about 200 chanting non-classified  employees demonstrated outside the district's offices as board members were  meeting.    Also this month, parents criticized the board for making a controversial change  in school attendance boundaries while they were at a retreat in Palm Springs,  with no members of the public present.    Several representatives of the teacher's union, wearing buttons that said,  ""Kids, not Politics,"" presented a ""State of the Schools"" report to the board  Thursday night, citing overcrowded classrooms and lack of support for the  district's bilingual education program.    Last year, the district's teachers staged a seven-day strike over wage  negotiations, and relations between them and the district are still less than  cordial.    The unions for both employee groups have jointly endorsed a field of  candidates, but did not support any incumbents.    They endorsed Nancy Moore, a former teacher who is now an administrator for the  Azusa Unified School District, for Area 3, the seat now held by McCracken; Lila  Beavans, a consultant to the Orangewood Children's Foundation, in Area 4,  Elliott's seat; Barry Resnick, a department chairman at Rancho Santiago College  for Area 5, who is running against Cherry; and James Preston, a medical doctor,  for Area 7, Evans' old seat.    The teachers did not endorse in the Area 1 race, the seat held by Englander.    ""We feel it's time for a change,"" Stover said in a recent interview. ""We feel  there's got to be a change in the direction of the school board. We're tired of  politics being the major motivator in this district.    ""Teachers are very frustrated because we know this is a good district in spite  of everything around us,"" she said. ""Yet it's getting more and more difficult  to stay here and fight the good fight when you really don't have the support,  when downtown has other priorities.""    But the biggest issue facing incumbents during this election is the ghost of  the past few years' troubles.    Bob Bennyhoff, who delivers sharp barbs to the board every chance he gets or in  Common Talk, a community newspaper partly owned by his wife, says the board has  not overcome the taint of the bid-rigging scandal.    ""There is a general sense of unease, a general sense of mistrust dating back to  the early '80s,"" he said recently. ""I don't believe the people of this district  have confidence in this board. . . . People still believe things are just not  right down there, and they will not support any of the current board members.""    Several candidates running for public office for the first time say that it was  those events that prompted them to enter the campaign.    In his campaign literature, candidate Al Irish, an accountant running for the  Area 7 seat, talks about ""the lack of trust and confidence the public, parents  and school employees have here in Orange."" Candidate Beavans says in a flyer:  ""The lack of leadership at the board level has caused serious problems in poor  morale among parents and employees.""    Other candidates say that the current board has spent so much time keeping  itself out of legal hot water that it hasn't had time to deal with the business  of educating children.    ""Our district has declined into a private club that is concerned less with our  children or schools and more with politics,"" said James Preston, another Area 7  candidate. ""I honestly believe the Orange Unified school board has let our  children down.""    Terri Sargent, a part-time land-use planner with the county, said she is  challenging Cherry ""because I want to put the focus back on the needs of  children.""    A two-year investigation by the Orange Police Department and the district  attorney's office resulted in the 1987 indictments of former district  maintenance supervisor Steven L. Presson, his wife and two contractors. They  were charged with misappropriation of public funds, but the complex case has  been stalled by delays and has yet to go to trial.    While no criminal action was taken against three members who were on the board  at the time of the alleged bid-rigging, the civil charges against them could  lead to a loss of office. A fourth board member, Eleanore Pleines, was also  accused by the grand jury, but she resigned her seat in 1987.    Cherry continues to fight the charges because he believes he should not be  penalized for the criminal actions of someone else.    ""It's just beyond me to know how I'm supposed to know what happens in the heart  of an organization when I come in part time and only as a policy-maker,"" he  said. ""We (the trustees) are actually policy-setters. We set policy and give  direction to the superintendent.""    He added that he would not be spending so much money to defend himself if he  was not innocent. The three board members have been told that if they do not  seek reelection, the charges will be dropped, because the only penalty is  removal from office.    ""If I don't run, I still have an obligation for a good deal of money to a legal  firm, and if I don't run, . . . it's all over, I'll have been smeared and I'll  never have an opportunity to defend myself. The decision to run was not  difficult. The decision not to run would have been extremely difficult for me.""    The incumbents say they realize that the baggage they bring from the past few  years could weigh them down during this campaign.    ""I guess right now I think we've been through a very hard last four years,""  Englander said. The investigations and charges ""really put most of us back a  while,"" she said. ""A lot of effort went into not so much defending (the three  board members), but we did file our own lawsuit against Presson and that took  up a lot our time. . . . It really has been a drain on our energies.""    ORANGE UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT CANDIDATES    On Tuesday, Nov. 7, voters in the Orange Unified School District will choose  candidates for five seats on the seven-member board of trustees. The  25,000-student district includes the cities of Orange and Villa Park, and parts  of Anaheim, Garden Grove and Santa Ana.

By MARIA NEWMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER      ORANGE      The lingering effects of a years-old kickback scandal and divisive labor  disputes have made the Orange Unified School District board race the most  crowded and controversial of the eight school contests on the Nov. 7 ballot.    Plagued by the scandal and a seven-day teachers' strike last spring, the first  in the county in three years, the district also has had more recent problems.  Board members were accused of making a controversial school-boundary change out  of the public eye by traveling to Palm Springs in August and making the  decision there.    This tumultuous atmosphere has resulted in 19 candidates vying for four  single-district seats and an unexpired term in a fifth area.    The three incumbents seeking reelection to the seven-member board have  struggled to get out from under the shadow of Orange County's biggest school  scandal in a decade. One of them, county General Services Agency supervisor Joe  J. Cherry, could face a new trial on charges in connection with the kickback  scandal that rocked the district more than three years ago.    Critics say that by running again, Cherry is prolonging the district's  inability to move beyond its infamy. Cherry, however, says he's running partly  to vindicate himself.    Six candidates have filed to run against him in Area 5, the highest number of  challengers in any of the Orange Unified races.    ""The shadow is not only over the board, but it's all over the whole district,""  said Kevin Rice, a businessman who is seeking election to another vacant seat.    The other two trustees implicated in the matter, Ruth C. Evans, who has served  20 years on the board, and Robert James Elliott, who has served for 25 years,  are not seeking reelection.    The three were accused by the 1986-87 Orange County Grand Jury of ""willful  misconduct in office"" for allegedly not minding the store while thousands of  dollars in kickback contracts were negotiated from the district's headquarters.    The other two incumbents seeking reelection besides Cherry, board President  Sandy Englander and trustee Jane McCracken, have consistently reminded voters  that they were not on the board when the alleged incidents of mismanagement  occurred.    McCracken was named to the board in February to fill a vacancy when member  William Steiner was appointed to the Orange City Council. By law, the district  must put his position on the ballot even though there are only two years left  in Steiner's four-year term.    The district has more than 25,000 students and includes the cities of Orange  and Villa Park, and portions of Anaheim, Garden Grove and Santa Ana.    The campaign has been marked by high spending -- some candidates say they are  spending as much as $20,000 -- political consultants advising the candidates  and a variety of forums in which district employees have tried to challenge  incumbents on the issues.    Earlier this month, about 80% of the district's 1,200 non-teaching employees  staged a sickout to protest a breakdown in wage negotiations. An agreement has  yet to be reached in that matter. On Thursday about 200 chanting non-classified  employees demonstrated outside the district's offices as board members were  meeting.    Also this month, parents criticized the board for making a controversial change  in school attendance boundaries while they were at a retreat in Palm Springs,  with no members of the public present.    Several representatives of the teacher's union, wearing buttons that said,  ""Kids, not Politics,"" presented a ""State of the Schools"" report to the board  Thursday night, citing overcrowded classrooms and lack of support for the  district's bilingual education program.    Last year, the district's teachers staged a seven-day strike over wage  negotiations, and relations between them and the district are still less than  cordial.    The unions for both employee groups have jointly endorsed a field of  candidates, but did not support any incumbents.    They endorsed Nancy Moore, a former teacher who is now an administrator for the  Azusa Unified School District, for Area 3, the seat now held by McCracken; Lila  Beavans, a consultant to the Orangewood Children's Foundation, in Area 4,  Elliott's seat; Barry Resnick, a department chairman at Rancho Santiago College  for Area 5, who is running against Cherry; and James Preston, a medical doctor,  for Area 7, Evans' old seat.    The teachers did not endorse in the Area 1 race, the seat held by Englander.    ""We feel it's time for a change,"" Stover said in a recent interview. ""We feel  there's got to be a change in the direction of the school board. We're tired of  politics being the major motivator in this district.    ""Teachers are very frustrated because we know this is a good district in spite  of everything around us,"" she said. ""Yet it's getting more and more difficult  to stay here and fight the good fight when you really don't have the support,  when downtown has other priorities.""    But the biggest issue facing incumbents during this election is the ghost of  the past few years' troubles.    Bob Bennyhoff, who delivers sharp barbs to the board every chance he gets or in  Common Talk, a community newspaper partly owned by his wife, says the board has  not overcome the taint of the bid-rigging scandal.    ""There is a general sense of unease, a general sense of mistrust dating back to  the early '80s,"" he said recently. ""I don't believe the people of this district  have confidence in this board. . . . People still believe things are just not  right down there, and they will not support any of the current board members.""    Several candidates running for public office for the first time say that it was  those events that prompted them to enter the campaign.    In his campaign literature, candidate Al Irish, an accountant running for the  Area 7 seat, talks about ""the lack of trust and confidence the public, parents  and school employees have here in Orange."" Candidate Beavans says in a flyer:  ""The lack of leadership at the board level has caused serious problems in poor  morale among parents and employees.""    Other candidates say that the current board has spent so much time keeping  itself out of legal hot water that it hasn't had time to deal with the business  of educating children.    ""Our district has declined into a private club that is concerned less with our  children or schools and more with politics,"" said James Preston, another Area 7  candidate. ""I honestly believe the Orange Unified school board has let our  children down.""    Terri Sargent, a part-time land-use planner with the county, said she is  challenging Cherry ""because I want to put the focus back on the needs of  children.""    A two-year investigation by the Orange Police Department and the district  attorney's office resulted in the 1987 indictments of former district  maintenance supervisor Steven L. Presson, his wife and two contractors. They  were charged with misappropriation of public funds, but the complex case has  been stalled by delays and has yet to go to trial.    While no criminal action was taken against three members who were on the board  at the time of the alleged bid-rigging, the civil charges against them could  lead to a loss of office. A fourth board member, Eleanore Pleines, was also  accused by the grand jury, but she resigned her seat in 1987.    Cherry continues to fight the charges because he believes he should not be  penalized for the criminal actions of someone else.    ""It's just beyond me to know how I'm supposed to know what happens in the heart  of an organization when I come in part time and only as a policy-maker,"" he  said. ""We (the trustees) are actually policy-setters. We set policy and give  direction to the superintendent.""    He added that he would not be spending so much money to defend himself if he  was not innocent. The three board members have been told that if they do not  seek reelection, the charges will be dropped, because the only penalty is  removal from office.    ""If I don't run, I still have an obligation for a good deal of money to a legal  firm, and if I don't run, . . . it's all over, I'll have been smeared and I'll  never have an opportunity to defend myself. The decision to run was not  difficult. The decision not to run would have been extremely difficult for me.""    The incumbents say they realize that the baggage they bring from the past few  years could weigh them down during this campaign.    ""I guess right now I think we've been through a very hard last four years,""  Englander said. The investigations and charges ""really put most of us back a  while,"" she said. ""A lot of effort went into not so much defending (the three  board members), but we did file our own lawsuit against Presson and that took  up a lot our time. . . . It really has been a drain on our energies.""    ORANGE UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT CANDIDATES    On Tuesday, Nov. 7, voters in the Orange Unified School District will choose  candidates for five seats on the seven-member board of trustees. The  25,000-student district includes the cities of Orange and Villa Park, and parts  of Anaheim, Garden Grove and Santa Ana.    Seats for areas 1, 4, 5 and 7 are 4-year terms; in area 3, voters will choose a  candidate to serve the remaining two years of William G. Steiner's term.

During the  interview, the minister indicated an intention to visit Japan  this year to hold talks with Japanese leaders on measures to  increase trade with Japan and Japanese investment in the  country, following similar talks with the United States and the  European Union (EU). He stated that, in addition to investment  in resources-related industries, South Africa hopes that direct  foreign investment will lead to an improvement of the social  infrastructure in such areas as housing construction,  electrification, and water supply as well as in tourism, to  which the Mandela administration is attaching importance.    Both the United States and the EU have moved toward closer  trade relations with South Africa. For example, they have  decided to apply general preferential duties to the country,  which has put an end to its apartheid policy following a  constituent parliamentary election in April. In showing  interest in consultations with Japan, the trade minister stated:  ""Japan has been positively investing in foreign nations, and it  has enjoyed trade surpluses."" He expressed hope that Japan will  help revitalize the South African economy by promoting both  investment and trade.     "

Speaking at Rustenburg during  his election campaign visit to the Western Transvaal, President  de Klerk said the East Rand was faced, not only with a security  problem, but with a socioeconomic issue. The solution had to  make provision for a socioeconomic upliftment program. He said  consultations were still being held with the ANC [African  National Congress] and the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] on the  multiparty plan.    President de Klerk said he was not worried about Mr. Nelson  Mandela's personal attacks on him because they were not based on  fact, but that it did concern him that somebody of Mr. Mandela's  status acted so irresponsibly. He said Mr. Mandela was making  personal attacks on him instead of condemning the activities of  the Self-Defense Units on the East Rand.    President de Klerk said the election was not centered on  freedom, because South Africans were already free, but that it  suited the opposition to talk about freedom as they did not have  a real message for the future.    He said right-wingers had no justification for threats of  war. The CP [Conservative Party] had lost two referendums and  two elections and would have to accept the majority decision.     "

While correct in recalling the predictions made at that time by pension fund managers and consultants, he should also remember that this same group took no initiative to provide the customers (the employees) with what they really wanted. This was a simple, clear, easy to understand 'pension account' - ie, such as provided by money purchase/defined contribution plans, where what is paid in by and on behalf of an individual remains identifiable and quantifiable and is not diverted to supplement early retirement pensions and executive top-up pensions of other colleagues. If the occupational pension fraternity had taken steps in the mid-1980s to accommodate the market demand 'in house' by providing alternative or supplementary defined contribution plans, most employees would never have spared a moment to consider personal pension plans. However, by insisting on a 'one size fits all/father knows best' policy of final pay plan the experts only hastened the stampede of misinformed but frustrated individuals who were thus encouraged to taste the forbidden and therefore exotic fruits of personal pensions.

0,FT941-17128 ,"FT941-17128 _AN-EAFCSACBFT 940106   FT  06 JAN 94 / Affair that raises questions for party of family values: The political fall-out for John Major after Tim Yeo's resignation      By KEVIN BROWN   As Oscar Wilde might have said, losing one minister as a result of a sex scandal looks like misfortune; losing two looks like carelessness. Mr Tim Yeo, who resigned yesterday as minister of state for the environment, had admitted being the father of a child born last year to an unmarried Tory councillor. The scandal of his extra-marital affair was less salacious than that with an actress that contributed to the downfall of Mr David Mellor as national heritage secretary in 1992. It is also likely to be less damaging, since Mr Yeo was not a member of the cabinet, although he was a competent and popular junior minister who might have gone further. However, the events leading to Mr Yeo's resignation raise awkward questions about the credibility of the government's campaign for traditional family values. The affair will also reinforce concern among Tory backbenchers about the political judgment of Mr John Major, the prime minister. Mr Major stood by Mr Mellor until it was clear that he could not survive because of the weight of criticism in the party and the press. He gave similar support to Mr Michael Mates before he was forced to resign as Norther Ireland minister because of his friendship with Mr Asil Nadir, the fugitive head of Polly Peck. Downing Street said nothing when Mr Yeo's extra-marital affair became public, but the prime minister's silence was widely interpreted as a gesture of support. It also emerged that Mr Major knew about Mr Yeo's relationship before it was revealed in the media, further strengthening the impression that it was not regarded as a resignation issue. In all three cases, the prime minister's motives were a combination of loyalty to ministers and a disinclination to allow the media to decide the composition of the government. Like Baroness Thatcher when she was prime minister, Mr Major has taken the view that private behaviour need not affect a minister's suitability for office if it is unrelated to their job. However, the Yeo affair has left the prime minister looking indecisive just when government strategists had hoped he would begin to demonstrate that his authority had recovered from last year's battering over Maastricht. The damage is not confined to Mr Major. Sir Norman Fowler, the Conservative chairman, and Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, also gave Mr Yeo public support - which now looks ill-judged. Some Conservative backbenchers were saying yesterday that Mr Major should have sacked Mr Yeo when the relationship became public on Boxing Day. The prime minister would have then made it clear that he was determined to pursue the traditional family values which were the focus of his speech to the party conference in October. That would have dispelled the air of hypocrisy which has clung to the government since it emerged that a minister who had called for a reduction in the number of single parent families had helped create one. This was the factor which prompted criticism of Mr Yeo from party officials in his Suffolk South constituency, where members were unimpressed by his promise to take financial responsibility for the child. There is a great deal of sympathy for Mr Yeo among Conservative backbenchers. Mr Peter Bottomley, a former minister, said his departure was 'deeply regrettable'. Mr Major also indicated, in a warm response to Mr Yeo's resignation letter, that he could return to the government after a period of penance on the back benches. This would be in line with the precedent set by the then Mr Cecil Parkinson, who resigned from the cabinet in similar circumstances in 1983 - but returned after the 1987 election. Several other ministers rumoured to have had affairs will be waiting nervously for the next blow to fall. Much appears to depend on luck. Mr Steven Norris, transport minister, appeared doomed last year when newspapers alleged he was involved with five mistresses.

The company has signed an agreement with Tongaat-Hulett, the diversified South African group, licensing Tongaat-Hulett to make and market CPC brands such as Mazola corn oil, Skippy peanut butter, Ambrosia desserts and Mueller's pasta for the South African market. Tongaat-Hulett will set up a company called Tongaat Consumer Foods to make and sell the CPC brands. This company will export CPC brands such as Knorr soups, Hellman's mayonnaise and Marmite spread to sub-Saharan Africa. First-year sales of Dollars 260m are expected. CPC pulled out of South Africa in 1987 on political grounds. Its decision to re-enter the market comes a week after Pillsbury, a US subsidiary of Britain's Grand Metropolitan group, said it was bringing its Jolly Green Giant and Pillsbury Doughboy brands to the South African market through a joint venture with a local company called Foodcorp. Mr CR Shoemate, CPC's chairman and chief executive, said: 'Now that Mr Mandela has called for a lifting of remaining sanctions, we are eager to return to South Africa, which was a very good market for us.'

""History will make it known that we're the terminators of  graft and vote bribery,"" Ma said in a speech to the group.    As of Sunday, 398 suspects, including 13 speakers, nine  deputy speakers, and 184 councilors -- a third of all sitting  councilors -- had been charged for either buying votes or  accepting bribes in the elections for speakers and deputy  speakers of the 23 county and city councils.    The ruling Kuomintang won all speaker and deputy speaker  seats.    Ma asked the group to keep rooting out corruption to make  sure the June and July elections for village and township chiefs  will be clean.    Meanwhile, the prosecutor's office in the central city of  Taichung charged Councilors Chen Jen-hsun, Chen Jui-teh and Ho  Wen-hai with accepting bribes worth between NT$7 million and  NT$7.4 million (US$261,200-US$276,120) from Speaker Kuo  Yen-sheng in exchange for their votes in the March 1 election.    The prosecutor recommended 30 months in jail for the three  defendants if they are found guilty.    Twenty-nine people have now been charged with graft  surrounding the Taichung City Council election.     "

By SCOTT KRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER      JOHANNESBURG, South Africa      Ten months ago, a black South African businessman emerged from a prison visit  with Nelson Mandela and raised the hopes of free-market advocates by announcing  that the African National Congress leader was beginning to sound soft on  nationalization.    Mandela promptly sent his followers a rare message: ""The nationalization of the  mines, banks and monopoly industries is the policy of the ANC, and a change or  modification of our views in this regard is inconceivable.""      Change of Heart?    But a few days ago, the ANC revealed, for the first time since it was legalized  Feb. 2, what it has in mind for the post-apartheid economy of South Africa, the  most economically powerful nation in sub-Saharan Africa.    The word nationalization was mentioned only once -- in a threat to  re-nationalize public utilities if the government proceeds with plans to  privatize them.    Is the ANC undergoing a change of heart? Or has it just learned that  nationalization is one of the most dangerously loaded words in the vocabulary  of whites here?    The answer appears to be a little of both, analysts say.    The 18-page ""discussion paper,"" which reflects current thinking among ANC  economists, suggests that the ANC has backed away from its rigid belief in a  centrally controlled economy.    And it has eased white fears that property and bank accounts would be summarily  nationalized under an ANC government.    The ANC envisions a mixed economy with a healthy private sector.    But it also sees a strong role for the government in directing the economy, to  correct severe racial inequities, redistributing wealth from the rich white  minority to the impoverished black majority.      Closing the Gap    The overwhelmingly white business establishment hasn't been overjoyed with the  ANC document. But there is no panic yet, and some even see signs for hope.    The ANC policy statement ""represents some closing of the gap between rhetoric  and reality,"" the South African Chamber of Business said. ""Many businessmen see  this ANC document as one small step for realism but a huge step for the ANC.""    Still, the chamber said, ""the overall impression remains that of an  organization which refuses to acknowledge what has manifestly failed  elsewhere.""    The chamber says the ANC and business leaders agree on only two things: the  need to restore business confidence and the need to create enough wealth and  employment to accommodate black as well as white South Africans.    They disagree strongly about which must come first, economic growth or wealth  redistribution.    The ANC thinks government- directed redistribution will spur growth.    ""The engine of growth in the economy . . . should be the growing satisfaction  of the basic needs of the impoverished and deprived majority,"" it says.    Electricity is one example the ANC has cited. Providing electricity to more  black areas will create jobs, which will have a multiplier effect and begin to  redistribute wealth, ANC economists say.    But many business leaders have been trying to persuade the ANC that the economy  will only grow and improve the life of blacks if free enterprise is encouraged,  a South African version of Ronald Reagan's trickle-down theory.    ""We can't escape our responsibility (to) uplift the poor,"" said Peter  Haasbroek, an economist for Barlow Rand, the largest industrial conglomerate in  South Africa. ""But we (business and the ANC) differ on the methods.""    ""Business is not opposed to slow, careful, step-by-step change,"" he added.  ""What we fear are marked, radical changes in policy.""    But the ANC is under pressure to make things happen quickly.    It doesn't want to scare off white business and investors from the United  States and Europe. Yet, expectations have been raised among black South  Africans, who outnumber whites 5 to 1 but who own less than 2% of the country's  productive assets.    ""Black South Africans look up to the ANC and say: 'We definitely don't expect  our position to continue like this forever,' "" says Tito Mboweni, an ANC  economist.      What of the Mines?    Nowhere are black expectations higher than in the mining industry, currently in  the hands of a few white-controlled conglomerates.    For 35 years, the ANC has been saying it wants to nationalize the mines, which  account for well over 33% of all exports and employ more than 350,000 black  workers.    Now, though, the ANC is treading more carefully.    It stops short of calling for nationalization of the mines, saying only that a  new government would need to consider ""the nature and extent of state  intervention and ownership.""

Mr Collor's opponents hope to score points by attacking the president and harping on the corruption claims. The national scandal is likely to take precedence over local issues in the nightly broadcasts. Free TV and radio time, awarded to big parties under Brazilian electoral law, will continue at least until the first round of municipal elections on October 3. Cracks have also begun to appear in the Liberal Front party (PFL), the anchor of Mr Collor's coalition support. Mr Joaquim Francisco, the PFL governor of the northeastern state of Pernambuco, has withdrawn his backing of the president. The report of the congressional commission investigating the activities of Mr Paulo Cesar Farias, Mr Collor's campaign treasurer and the focus of the corruption allegation, is to be completed on Saturday and presented to the committee for approval on August 26. The report will serve as the basis for impeachment charges against the president. A poll by DataFolha, associated with the opposition newspaper Folha de Sao Paulo, showed that 70 per cent of those surveyed in 11 cities want the Congress to remove Mr Collor from office. AP adds from Braslia; The powerful Brazilian Bar Association said yesterday it would support impeachment of the president.  The Financial Times   London Page 5  "

Mr Kenneth Kaunda, in cravat and dapper safari suit, and Mr  Julius Nyerere, carrying a wood and ivory swagger stick, are  among 180 VIP guests at the inauguration of Nelson Mandela as  South Africa's first black president.    Mr Kaunda and Mr Nyerere led their respective countries to  independence and one-party rule more than 20 years ago. Zambia  was ruled by Mr Kaunda until his election defeat by Frederick  Chiluba, who is also in South Africa for the inauguration.    Mr Kaunda received a big hug and kisses on both cheeks from  Palistinian Liberation Organisation Chairman Yassir 'Arafat, who  arrived with his blonde wife to cheers and whistles. Mr 'Arafat  smiled broadly and waved at the crowd, clearly pleased with his  reception.    Anti apartheid movement founder Bishop Trevor Huddelston  posed with Mr Nyerere and Mrs Adelaide and Dali Tambo, the wife  and son of the late African National Congress Former President  Oliver Tambo.

By ROBERT A. ROSENBLATT, TIMES STAFF WRITER      WASHINGTON      Joining a rising chorus of political anger over savings and loan fraud, Senate  Banking Committee Chairman Donald W. Riegle Jr. (D-Mich.) on Monday called for  ""a more aggressive crackdown"" on the white-collar criminals who helped cripple  the thrift industry.    ""The need for additional investigative and prosecutorial resources is  unlimited,"" Riegle said in a major Senate speech. He accused the Bush  Administration of failing to ask for enough funds to pursue the perpetrators of  financial fraud.    A Justice Department spokesman fired back at Riegle, saying ""it's too  simplistic to suggest more money means more cases investigated and prosecuted.""    S&L fraud cases ""are hard cases to make,"" said Douglas Tillett, the Justice  Department spokesman. ""We have to bring evidence and prove guilt -- members of  Congress can hold a press conference and not be accountable for their grand  ideas.""    Riegle, a key author of the 1989 S&L rescue bill that provided funding for  the sale or shutdown of hundreds of insolvent thrifts, added his influential  voice to a new wave of criticism sweeping through Congress. Lawmakers are among  those having to cope with the political fallout from the biggest financial  scandal in American history.    Because savings deposits are insured up to $100,000, taxpayers will bear the  massive financial burden for cleaning up the defunct S&Ls and disposing of  their assets. The Bush Administration said last month that the cleanup cost had  been badly underestimated. It said it would need as much as $60 billion more  for the job.    Although the complexities of the scandal have been slow to penetrate the public  consciousness, politicians draw big applause when they call for retribution  against those who helped loot S&Ls.    Congress authorized $75 million for prosecuting thrift fraud, but the  Administration limited its request to $49 million, Riegle said.    ""The Administration opposition to additional funds for savings and loan fraud  prosecutions is difficult to reconcile with available evidence on the magnitude  of the problems and the Justice Department's current resources,"" Riegle said.    The Justice Department spokesman said his agency is spending the  fraud-prosecution money effectively and doesn't need more. ""To appropriate  money in December, 1989, and expect to put people in jail in June, 1990, is a  little unrealistic,"" Tillett said. The Justice Department has created 155 new  slots for FBI agents and 118 for assistant U.S. attorneys, but needs hundreds  more, Riegle said.    His willingness to write a virtual blank check to pay for S&L fraud  prosecution illustrates the growing intensity of the issue on Capitol Hill.  More than 100 House members have signed a resolution calling for a special  prosecutor to deal with thrift fraud.    Sen. Alan J. Dixon (D-Ill.), joining several Democratic senators in proposing a  special strike force last week, said: ""This country is being robbed blind, and  the crooks are getting away scot-free.""    The Justice Department says it has 27 local task forces capable of doing the  job. ""You've got a lot of angry constituents raising the issue with their  elected representatives -- and rightly so,"" said Tillett. ""Members of Congress  are looking for a quick solution to a problem not quickly solved.""    It takes an average of three to four years to bring a case from investigation  to trial. Congress recognized the problem by extending the statute of  limitations for financial fraud to 10 years from five, he said.    The cases, like other fraud committed by white-collar criminals, are difficult  to prosecute. The crimes are intricate, the perpetrators often well-known,  once-respected members of the business community.    There seems scant opportunity to recover much of the billions of dollars in  losses suffered by S&Ls, federal officials believe. They feel that the  money has melted away along with the collapse of real estate values in many  markets.    Inflated values of land, office buildings, shopping centers and condominiums  plunged after the markets turned bad. Those who made the biggest profit were  the last sellers of the property before the bust, according to L. William  Seidman, chairman of the Resolution Trust Corp., the agency handling the  dismantling of crippled S&Ls.    Riegle also was critical of efforts to dispose of failed S&Ls. ""While the  pace is now accelerating, the overall progress to date must be considered  disappointing,"" he said.    The government has inherited thousands of properties from defunct S&Ls,  including shopping centers, office buildings, homes and land.    ""There is no simple recipe for orderly, efficient and cost-effective  disposition of these assets, particularly given the slack real estate markets  in areas where the real estate inventory is largest,"" Riegle said. ""This unique  and very difficult problem needs the sustained attention of the administrative  agencies, Congress and the public.""      Photo, Sen. Donald W.

There seems scant opportunity to recover much of the billions of dollars in  losses suffered by S&Ls, federal officials believe. They feel that the  money has melted away along with the collapse of real estate values in many  markets.    Inflated values of land, office buildings, shopping centers and condominiums  plunged after the markets turned bad. Those who made the biggest profit were  the last sellers of the property before the bust, according to L. William  Seidman, chairman of the Resolution Trust Corp., the agency handling the  dismantling of crippled S&Ls.    Riegle also was critical of efforts to dispose of failed S&Ls. ""While the  pace is now accelerating, the overall progress to date must be considered  disappointing,"" he said.    The government has inherited thousands of properties from defunct S&Ls,  including shopping centers, office buildings, homes and land.    ""There is no simple recipe for orderly, efficient and cost-effective  disposition of these assets, particularly given the slack real estate markets  in areas where the real estate inventory is largest,"" Riegle said. ""This unique  and very difficult problem needs the sustained attention of the administrative  agencies, Congress and the public.""      Photo, Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr. called for a crackdown on those responsible  for the S&L crisis and more funds for investigations and prosecution.

Nunez, who was on leave for 60 days to facilitate the  investigations conducted by a presidential committee, has  reiterated that he is innocent but admitted that the scandal is  harming the police institution and for this reason he should  leave his post.    In announcing his resignation to reporters, Nunez said the  institution's image has been seriously damaged and this has  increased the agressiveness of criminals. In a noticeably  shaken voice, Nunez said: Because of this basic consideration  which is of an institutional and social-safety nature, I find  that I must withdraw from the General Command by submitting my  resignation.    The cabinet today discussed the resignation of the police  chief. A government spokesman has told REUTER that Nunez'  departure is a fact and that President Sixto Duran-Ballen will  appoint a new commander general before Monday.    Nunez, who is well known for his diligent struggle against  the underworld, has been accused of illegal acquisition of  wealth and abuse of power. The charges, which initially were  filed in mid-May against Nunez only, gradually were applied to  the entire police staff by Police Colonel Hector Estrella, who  exposed the scandal.

So Mazda bought the services of a social psychologist to interpret some 'qualitative research group discussions'. This has given rise to some startling insights. 'Something with Factor X certainly has 'je ne sais quoi' and has undoubtedly got 'it'.' Beyond that, not much.

0,FT921-14675 ,"FT921-14675 _AN-CAOBBAA7FT 920115   FT  15 JAN 92 / Sinking funds: The so-called pensions experts to task      By JOHN PLENDER   The enormity of the scam perpetrated by the late Robert Maxwell on present and future pensioners of his ailing business empire still leaves even sophisticated observers aghast. Yet there is something equally shocking about the loud protestations from pensions experts that no pension fund can be fully protected from a determined crook bent on theft. This is beside the point when the inadequacy of a regulatory structure based on the rickety protection of trust law has constituted an open invitation to crooks for 30 years or more. Employees and pensioners both in and out of the Maxwell empire deserve a better answer to the question of why it was allowed to happen. The warning signals have been there for years - not least in the newspaper industry. After the News Chronicle went bust in 1960, employees and pensioners discovered that their retirement incomes were funded out of revenue without the backing of a fund. When a shareholder challenged an attempt to compensate people at the defunct paper for the loss of pension rights, the High Court ruled against compensation. Since then there have been countless cases where directors of relatively small companies have looted pension funds when their company ran into trouble. Pensions experts said the abuse was confined to a small minority of funds. Some consolation for those whose retirement was wrecked. Then there was the plight of hundreds of thousands who lost their jobs in the recession of the early 1980s. The rules of most pension schemes ensure that so-called early leavers end up subsidising the benefits of those who are lucky enough to keep their jobs. The huge resulting transfer of real wealth from the less fortunate to the more fortunate went largely unremarked. Yet this abuse of trust was arguably a far worse scandal than anything done by Mr Maxwell. But the biggest scandal of all is that this Pounds 400bn industry has been hijacked for purposes quite different from those for which occupational pension schemes were originally set up. A pension fund exists to deliver the best possible retirement benefits to employees or it is nothing. Yet the trustees of pension schemes across the land have allowed pension funds to be turned into profit centres for the company. Money that should have been devoted to improving pension benefits - not least for existing and deferred pensioners who have been appallingly short-changed - has been used to bolster profits through pension holidays and now withdrawals. This may differ from the Maxwell case in that there is not necessarily any suggestion of illegality and such practice has been encouraged by government and by Inland Revenue rules on the uses of pension fund surpluses. But is it moral? The scandal extends far beyond Maxwell. And clearly politicians and their officials are substantially to blame. Having failed to deliver a decent state pension scheme, successive governments failed to deliver adequate regulatory arrangements for private occupational pensions. Industrialists, in their role as trustees, have also behaved less than admirably, since they have increasingly lost sight of the real purpose of the trust (and in some cases made disproportionate claims on their own pension funds for inflated retirement incomes). But in the final analysis perhaps it is the ever-vociferous pensions lobby that deserves most scorn. I recall, as long ago as 1978, writing an investigation for The Economist on incestuous financial relations between companies and their pension funds - in other words, incipient Maxwellitis. The response of the then chairman of the National Association of Pension Funds was that 'the last thing we want is more legislation and control'. As irony would have it, the gentleman in question was also director of pensions at Reed International, then the owner of - you've guessed it - Mirror Group Newspapers. No doubt the 'we' in question referred not to the pensioners but to the pensions industry - that gaggle of actuaries, lawyers, bankers and consultants who have profited so mightily over a long period from one of Britain's richest gravy trains. Their response to calls for tighter regulation, better treatment of deferred pensioners or better treatment of virtually anyone else, has invariably been to appeal to the lowest common denominator of 19th century corporate behaviour by claiming that the slightest increase in costs would cause employers to reduce benefits or close down the funds. They even managed to argue that the introduction of compensation funds to protect victims of abuse would be too expensive, while simultaneously claiming that abuse was minimal. When the government finally and belatedly frames a new pension act in response to Maxwell, it should treat this dismal, self-serving lobby with the disrespect that its past performance deserves. It should aim for a thorough ring-fence around the fund to ensure the greatest possible independence from management; better treatment for pension rights in a winding-up; a decent compensation scheme; and an end to the ambiguity over the ownership of pension funds. Pension rights that can be so easily removed from employees are not worthy of the name. They are a fraud, like the late Mr Maxwell.  The Financial Times   London Page 18  "

""I have already answered (on the loan problem)  wholeheartedly. (but) if the House of Representatives Budget  Committee is held, (I) will speak about what I can tell,""  Hosokawa said.    The LDP has refused to open budget deliberations unless  Hosokawa produces proof to support his claim that he returned  the 100 million yen he received from Sagawa Kyubin Co.    Hosokawa, who spoke to reporters at his official residence,  however, rejected an opposition demand to submit further  documents related to his loan from Sagawa in 1982.    The premier also turned down another opposition demand that  the Diet summon his former secretaries to clear up the loan  problem.    ""We must be careful not to set a precedent for calling up  private (sector) people (to the Diet),"" he said.    Hosokawa has insisted that he borrowed the money to repair  his home in Kumamoto Prefecture and buy a condominium in Tokyo,  and that he fully repaid the money nine years later.    The parcel delivery firm was involved in a money-and-mob  scandal which forced former LDP kingpin Shin Kanemaru to resign  in disgrace in 1992.    Hosokawa also brushed aside the LDP's reported intensifying  attempt to bring down the government, saying it is a matter of  the LDP's interparty affairs.     "

Like any good Japanese, he took the money to the police.    Counting the crumbling bills with some difficulty, they calculated that the  39-year-old restaurateur had picked up the equivalent of $1 million.    The gorudo rashu came next -- a gold-rush fever that brought hundreds of  money-seekers swarming to the grove in Kawasaki, hoping lightning might strike  twice.    And five days later, a humble part-time laborer, 21, who was actually hunting  for wild cress, tripped across another $700,000 in yen.    The frenzy grew, as hundreds more searched for a ""third installment."" And the  mystery of who would abandon nearly $2 million without even burying it, and  then fail to claim the cash when it was found, seemed to obsess the nation,  even more than the news of the political scandal shaking the government.    Indeed, many observers saw a connection between easy money flowing through the  political world and the mysterious cash of the bamboo forest. It helped  headline writers, although not the embattled prime minister, that the first  character of Noboru Takeshita's name means ""bamboo"" -- and that he had received  about $2 million from Recruit Co., the conglomerate at the center of the  scandal that has forced him to announce his resignation.    But as Japan's press rushed forward with theory after theory -- each more lurid  than the last -- to explain the unclaimed cache, the dark side of politics was  but one rich lode. Mystery writers were interviewed, past murders rehashed,  fantastic scenarios constructed around drugs and gangsters, blackmail and tax  evasions.    In many ways, the speculation reflected modern Japanese anxieties -- fear that  unaccustomed prosperity is corrupting morals and dividing rich from poor, old  from young.    ""The average Japanese cannot play the money game, and when these worlds  collide, as they did in the bamboo thicket, public interest is immense,"" the  newspaper Yomiuri said in an editorial. ""It seems that recently the gap between  the average citizen and the ultrarich has vastly widened . . . that our  society's view toward money has become very distorted, and this causes great  frustration for many Japanese.""    Many experts -- and nearly all Japanese depicted themselves as experts on the  subject -- said the money was somehow connected to soaring land or stock prices  that seem to be disrupting Japan's stable, middle-class society.    While the press speculated and philosophized, police methodically investigated.  Paper wrappers around the cash carried dates and the names of several credit  unions in the Kawasaki area, outside Tokyo.    Comparing the wrappers with bank records, police eventually focused on the  president of a mail-order business, Kasuyasu Noguchi, 46, who had made sizable  withdrawals two and three years ago.    Noguchi recently held a press conference and said, yes, the money belonged to  him. Bowing deeply, he apologized to the people of the world for the trouble he  had caused.    But Noguchi's explanation, as provided to reporters and more fully to police,  was ""beyond comprehension,"" Yomiuri said.    Noguchi said he actually had earned the cash in the early 1970s, speculating in  stamps and other things. A thief had been stalking his office, he told police,  so for years he carried the money in the trunk of his car.    When Japan began printing a new type of cash, Noguchi exchanged the money for  new bills -- thus the wrappers indicating withdrawals two and three years ago.    But, he said, his desire for the money lessened as friends were murdered or  committed suicide in business-related matters.    ""My view of life changed,"" Noguchi told police.    He resolved to give the money away, he said, but -- acknowledging that he had  failed to pay taxes on the income -- he feared a tax audit if he donated the  money in his own name. So, he said, in October, 1987, he left $2 million in the  bamboo grove, hoping someone worthy would find it.    He was ""relieved"" when someone recovered the money, he said. If he gets it  back, he said he will donate it for research into children's diseases.    Police said they found the explanation puzzling but that they saw no basis for  further criminal investigation. Tax authorities said they would investigate,  but income earned so long ago would be beyond their reach.    Seiei Sato, the grilled-chicken seller who found the first chunk of cash, said  he, too, remained mystified by Noguchi's account, but might be willing to  settle for a 20% finder's fee and go back to serving yakitori.

He said he hoped to announce a date for the meeting later this week. If the talks go ahead - plans for similar meetings have fallen through in the past  -it would be the first time the two men had met for negotiations in more than two years. The African National Congress is understood to have agreed last month that Mr Mandela, their leader, should meet Chief Buthelezi in an attempt to strike a deal with him on a post-apartheid constitution. Agreement between the ANC and Chief Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom party on the key issue of devolution of power to regions would remove one of the most important obstacles to multi-party agreement on a new constitution. The ANC has made substantial concessions recently, agreeing that regional governments should have powers entrenched in the constitution which could not be amended by the central government without substantial support from deputies elected to a national house of assembly based on regions. No deal has yet been struck on the powers to be devolved to regional level, with the ANC proposing far less devolution than Inkatha. But Inkatha officials said they believed the ANC position would eventually form the basis for a deal between the two sides.   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.

The House of Representatives Budget Committee made the  decision in a bid to substantiate Hosokawa's assertion that he  repaid a 1982 loan of 100 million yen from Kiyoshi Sagawa, then  chairman of the Sagawa Kyubin group of trucking and  parcel-delivery firms and one of key figures in a money-and-mob  scandal.    Committee debates on a third supplementary budget for fiscal  1993 were interrupted to deal with the matter after negotiations  by senior committee officials over the issue ran into problems,  parliamentary sources said.    Hosokawa has said he borrowed the money to buy a condominium  and repair his home in Kumamoto, western Japan, and that he  repaid the loan by January 31, 1991.    On Tuesday morning, Hosokawa turned in a ""certificate""  issued  by the Tokyo branch of Sagawa Kyubin which says ""the 100 million  yen has been entirely repaid and collateral rights have ceased.""    But two opposition parties, the Liberal Democratic Party  (LDP) and the Japanese Communist Party, were not satisfied with  the document.    Hosokawa last December submitted a memo to the opposition  intended to substantiate his claim.    The Sagawa Kyubin group was embroiled in a money scandal  involving a number of leading figures, including Shin Kanemaru,  former LDP kingmaker, who was charged with tax evasion last  March.     "

Emerging from a meeting of senior party lawmakers, Acting  Chairman Kim Won-ki also told reporters that the DP would call  for the entire cabinet's resignation.    ""The Constitution requires that the cabinet be appointed  through the recommendation of the prime minister. Moreover, the  resignation of Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang, according to the  announcement of Chongwadae [presidential office], is something  like reprehension. So the cabinet must resign en masse in  consideration of the spirit of the Constitution and the mistakes  made by the incumbent cabinet,"" said Kim.    The major opposition party also decided to take issue with  the constitutional, political and even moral procedures of Yi's  resignation before dealing with the approval of the new prime  minister at the National Assembly.    According to Kim, the DP will demand that the National  Assembly convene a separate, full assembly session to discuss  Lee's resignation. The demand will be made during Monday's  National Assembly meeting, called to handle the Sangmudae  scandal involving suspected bribery in the relocation of  military facilities in Kwangju, the southwestern provincial  capital.    Kim also cited the poor performance of Prime  Minister-Designate Yi while serving as unification minister as  the party's reason for opposing his appointment.

0,FT941-5271 ,"FT941-5271 _AN-ECHD1AA0FT 940308   FT  08 MAR 94 / Moves afoot to lift politician's immunity: Construction industry inquiry widens      By WILLIAM DAWKINS   Japanese public prosecutors are considering whether to lift a former construction minister's parliamentary immunity after his refusal to answer questions on alleged bribery. Mr Kishiro Nakamura, a lower house member of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party, yesterday defied investigators seeking fresh evidence in a widening inquiry into corruption in the building industry. This will test whether investigators are determined to arrest Mr Nakamura. So far, more than 30 construction company executives and local politicians have been arrested in what has become the biggest corruption scandal since the second world war. But the prosecutors have so far stopped short of seizing a national politician or bureaucrat. To obtain Mr Nakamura's arrest, the public prosecutor's office would have to ask parliament's permission to lift his immunity, a tactic last employed 26 years ago. Prosecutors want to question Mr Nakamura about allegations that while construction minister he had received Y10m (Pounds 64,100) from a leading contractor in return for persuading the Fair Trade Commission to drop a 1991 investigation into bid rigging. The FTC subsequently announced it would file no complaints against any of the 66 companies involved, fuelling US anger over covert barriers to foreign competition in the building industry. This is the latest sign the purge against corruption is being stepped up, following the appointment of a new prosecutor-general, Mr Yusuke Yoshinaga, head case officer on the Lockeed scandals of the 1970s. His office announced yesterday it had assigned seven extra staff to the construction case, enlarging the team to 35.   Countries:-  JPZ  Japan, Asia.

This was decided by Bonn by lifting  the halt to arms deliveries to Turkey. Germany sends weapons to  a state that systematically oppresses, drives away, and kills  the Kurds. This signals to the government in Ankara that the  destruction of the Kurdish people continues to be more or less  tolerated.    For this reason the question whether Turkish soldiers in the  southeast of the country fight with German armaments is  important, but not of a central nature. Now it becomes obvious  that Kinkel's order to examine evidence of the use of German  weapons was only a show to calm down critics. One can only call  it cynical how the Federal Government ignores statements by  eyewitnesses, misinterprets films, and adopts the excuses of the  Turkish Government in those instances where German armaments are  clearly visible in photographs.    However, the end of the halt to arms deliveries would be a  scandal even if Turkey were no longer to use any weapons from  Germany against the Kurds. The more armaments are streaming  into the country, the less the military needs to worry about its  stocks, the more unscrupulously can Ankara wage its war in the  southeast. In addition, the symbolic importance of the decision  made by Bonn is even more murderous than the continued use of  German weapons in practice: It confirms to the Turkish  Government its knowledge that, for Germany, good relations with  the geostrategically important NATO partner are more important  than the Kurdish people's right to existence.

0,FT924-9492 ,"FT924-9492 _AN-CKEB7AA2FT 921105   FT  05 NOV 92 / France to strengthen transfusion controls      By WILLIAM DAWKINS      PARIS   THE French cabinet yesterday drew up tough rules on the handling of blood for transfusions to try to avoid a repeat of the scandal in which the national transfusion service gave HIV-infected blood to more than 1,200 haemophiliacs. The rules would increase state control over the conditions under which blood is donated, checked for disease and transported, at a time when EC single-market regulations will end the monopoly of the national blood transfusion service. This has become of high political importance in France, following the passing of prison sentences on three senior health service officials accused of criminal negligence and fraud in allowing HIV-contaminated blood to be distributed. Concern has deepened with the revelation that Institut Merieux, a leading pharmaceuticals group, had until November 1985 exported blood without heat-treating it for HIV. The new rules, which will go before parliament for final approval, forbid distribution in France of blood from paid donors, punishable by up to five years in prison and a FFr1m (Pounds 110,000) fine. Blood must be tested for HIV and treated before being distributed and the identities of donors and recipients must be kept confidential. The law also establishes a national blood agency to monitor the collection, processing and distribution of blood products. It will have a team of inspectors, responsible for overseeing 163 blood donation centres, and will be responsible for blood processing laboratories. Previously, the French blood products system had no central organisation, except for the transfusion service, responsible solely for stocking and distribution.  The Financial Times   London Page 2  "

Four years and three months ago, I said in  parliament that the time has come for us to break out of the  cycle of conflict, tension, and violent struggle in which we  have been embroiled for decades. I said that the table had been  laid for sensible leaders to begin talking about a new  dispensation and to reach an understanding by way of dialogue  and negotiation. I said that the agenda would include a new and  dynamic constitution, the removal of any form of discrimination  and domination, equality before an independent judiciary, the  protection of minorities as well as of individual rights,  freedom of religion, and universal franchise.    During the past week, we have seen the realization of that  vision. We have a new and dynamic constitution. We have the  assurance that there will be no domination of any South Africans  by any others. We have seen the end of discrimination. We have  equality before the law. Minority rights have been secured.  Individual rights and all these other rights are guaranteed by a  charter of fundamental rights and by a strong and effective  constitutional court, and during the past week we have held our  first universal franchise election. After so many centuries we  will finally have a government which represents all South  Africans. After so many centuries all South Africans are now  free. [applause]    This new election did not take place without problems.  We had serious hitches, shortcomings, and irregularities. Hard  work is taking place to deal with these problems within the  framework of the law, and the necessary steps will be taken.  Despite all these problems, there can, however, be no doubt  that the ANC has received the most votes countrywide and the  National Party, the second most votes. The National Party [NP]  will ensure during the ratification process that it and other  parties get everything they have a legal right to, and that  errors will be corrected as far as possible. This must happen  quickly. South Africans are impatient. The new parliament, the  government, and regional governments must be put together now.  We must move ahead in this country.    Despite all these problems, a word of thanks is in  order. Many people worked hard to make the election possible.  They had little time, and many changes took place during the  process, such as the double ballot and the Inkatha Freedom  Party's entry to the election. I also wish to express my thanks  to Judge Johann Kriegler and the IEC [Independent Electoral  Commission] for their hard work. The fact that we had  serious criticism does not in any way detract from our  appreciation. To the Air Force too, which in the end had to  jump in to lend a hand, also a word of thanks. Thank you also  to the security forces, and in particular the South African  Police, for their contribution to a peaceful election. And  especially to the voters, in particular those who supported the  NP. We will not disappoint you.    While we concede that another party gained the most  votes, the NP says: Our second place is not a defeat; it is a  victory for the cause we stand for. [applause] The  spirit among the voters during the election was a revelation, a  revelation that we must never forget. There was tolerance,  patience, excitement, and a visible desire for reconciliation  and peace. Our people want the new South Africa to work, the  election to succeed, the bitterness of the past to be put aside.  This attitude must serve as a guideline, to all leaders in the  years ahead, of what the people of South Africa expect of  them.    I also said four years ago that Mr. Nelson Mandela would  play  an important role, and then noted that he had declared himself  willing to make a constructive contribution to the peaceful  political process in South Africa. During the past four years  Mr. Mandela has played such a role. His role was a leading and  an honorable one. I thank him, and I congratulate him. He  deserves the congratulations, good wishes, and prayers of all  South Africans. I look forward to working with him  constructively within the government of national unity in our  common effort to promote the well-being of all our people.    During the past four years we have proved that we can work  together. Despite our differences, our relationship has become a  symbol of the ability of South Africans from widely different  backgrounds to cooperate in the national interest. This spirit  will be essential to the success of the government of national  unity.    He will soon assume the highest office in the land with all  the awesome responsibility which it bears. He will have to  exercise this great responsibility in a balanced manner which  will assure South Africans from all our communities that he has  all their interests at heart. I am confident that that will be  his intention. Mr. Mandela has walked a long road and now stands  at the top of the hill. A traveler would sit down and admire  the view, but a man of destiny knows that beyond this hill lies  another, and another. The journey is never complete. As he  contemplates the next hill, I hold out my hand to Mr. Mandela in  friendship and in cooperation. As far as my own position is  concerned, I should like to make it clear that I believe that my  political task is just beginning. Everything that we have done  so far -- the four years of difficult and often frustrating  negotiations, the problems and the crises -- have been simply a  preparation for the work that lies ahead. [applause]    The greatest challenge...the greatest challenge which we  will  face in the government of national unity will be to defend and  nurture our new constitution. Our greatest task will be to  ensure that our young and vulnerable democracy takes root and  flourishes. We must make the transitional constitution a living  organism. We must remain vigilant against any attempts by any  level of government to erode any aspect of the constitution or  of individual minority or religious rights. Our courts must  build up a sound basis of case law which will provide further  guarantees for the maintenance of constitutional rights. We  must rally all the genuinely democratic institutions of our  society in a grand coalition for the defense of the constitution  and its principles. We must also ensure that we adopt the right  approaches in the economic and social spheres. We need a strong  and a vibrant economy based on tried and tested principles of  free enterprise. Only then can we ensure that we will generate  the wealth which we need to address the pressing social needs of  large sections of our population. We must ensure that social  services are affordable, caring, and effective.    We must also continue to observe our values, good  family values, the moral values befitting a country based on  Christian norms and standards.    I will be in a good position in the government of national  unity to promote these objectives. I will not be there at the  whim of any person or any party, but in my own right as the  leader of the National Party, as the representative of many  millions of South Africans who have put their trust in us and  who have supported our policies and our principles. [applause]  Just as we could not rule South Africa effectively without the  support of the ANC and its supporters, no government will be  able to rule South Africa effectively without the support of the  people and the institutions that I as your leader in the  National Party represent. I enthusiastically pledge that  support in the interests of working for national reconciliation  and reconstruction.    Our party is in a good position to make a key  contribution in this regard. The changes that have taken place  within the National Party over the past few years are nothing  short of a miracle. This fact will be proven in the expected  election results. Although we are not the biggest party at  present, there can be little doubt that our party is the most  representative party of all our population groups. This is a  solid foundation for the future and for future growth.    I wish all in our party, my fellow leaders, our workers  who worked so hard in this election, all our supporters, good  luck with our performance in the election. Thank you for the  graciousness you showed in making possible the changes we have  introduced. Thank you for your hard work and sacrifice, faith,  and support, and loyalty. It is that which we will be able to  build upon.    We in our party represent to a certain extent the nucleus of  our new nation. Within our party we have already achieved the  reconciliation which South Africa as a whole needs. We believe  that we have the recipe for the future, and we plan to spread  our message and win further support, until one day we shall be  the largest party in the country. [applause] Our objective will  be to prove this already at the polls in five years' time.    I know there are those who are skeptical towards the  new dispensation, and there are also those who even want to  oppose it violently. If for them it involves religious freedom,  language, cultural rights, or individual rights, or community  rights, then I say to them tonight, we must stand together,  because we in this party will also fight for those rights. If  they are concerned about self-determination in a practically  achievable manner without ever again bringing back any form of  discrimination on a single inch of land in South Africa, then I  say, we will support that. But if it involves racism and  unachievable dreams, then they are on the wrong path, and then  there will be no peace. Then it will be a useless course, and I  ask them tonight: Become part of the solution. The election  has shown once and for all that those minorities which want to  force solutions on their fellow South Africans are heading  toward a dead end.    I should also like to use this opportunity to thank all  those  who have helped South Africa, to bring South Africa to this new  era. The list is very long. It includes our negotiators, the  cabinet, officials, the security forces who have helped to keep  the process on track. It includes foreign leaders who have  given us so much support. It includes you, the supporters of my  party. It includes thousands of ordinary people who have  remembered us in their prayers.    Most importantly, on a very personal note, I must thank my  wife, Marike, and my family. [applause]    Ladies and gentlemen, this is an important milestone in the  history of our country, perhaps the most important that we will  ever see. Next Tuesday I shall lay down my responsibilities as  state president, secure in the knowledge that we have achieved  what we set out to achieve four years and three months ago. I  shall be handing over the presidency to Mr. Mandela, but I shall  not be leaving government. I shall be surrendering power not to  the majority of the moment, but to the South African people. I  shall do so with the strong conviction that henceforth  sovereignty will ultimately lie with them and in the  constitution. A power greater than man has given South Africa  the spirit, the chance to go forward in peace. God Almighty has  been kind to us. Now it is up to the political leaders to join  together, to work together, for the good of our people, and to  complete the task of healing and reconciliation. God bless  South Africa. Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika [God Bless Africa]. Thank  you. [applause]     "

Sani Abacha, to relinquish power  without delay.    In an open letter dated 11 May, released to the media in  Lagos late Monday [16 May], the Anglican cleric urged the  Nigerian leader to reverse immediately the annulment of  country's 12 June 1993 election results and install a  democratically elected government. ""Now is the time for you to  bow out honourably"" he said. ""If you cannot see the handwriting  on the wall and bow out, the end may be inglorious."" Rev.  Adetiloye told Abacha that refusal to [word indistinct] would  throw Nigeria into ""a disastrous revolution"" that could divide  the country.    In an apparent reference to former military ruler, Gen.  Ibrahim Babangida, who stepped down from after annulling the  elections in which millionaire businessman Moshood Abiola  claimed victory, the archbishop said: ""De-annul the annulment,  install the democratically elected president and [word  indistinct] honour as a hero of the decade, otherwise your exit  would be equally inglorious.""    The archbishop expressed surprise that the Nigerian leader  had gone to South Africa to witness the inauguration of  President Nelson Mandela after his (Abacha's) ""active  participation in the annulment of a free, fair and peaceful  election"" of Nigeria's own president.    The archbishop's letter comes in the wake of growing  pressure  from various organisations, groups and individuals on the  Nigerian leader to step down. [passage indistinct]     "

To Remain in Government or Go Into Constructive  Opposition?""]    [Text] Whatever the end of the ""rotation"" of cadres saga  which began as a result of Yegor Gaydar's resignation statement  Sunday, the very fact of this ""incident"" already speaks volumes.  It feels like a new revolt or coup, or Zhirinovskiy's final  victory at some future elections, has just been announced. And  this is despite the fact that, even without Gaydar, the  government managed to maintain its reformist course in the first  nine months of last year. But now is not September 1993 but  January 1994.    Last fall it seemed that the market coordinates had finally  been plotted and that the government's policy had been entirely  formalized in this sense. The elections in December 1993  confirmed the forecast of virtually all sober analysts that  opposition in society could not be eliminated through coercive  methods and the situation of September-October 1993 would be  repeated more than once according to the same pattern. And  therefore it would be just as difficult to carry out a liberal  economic policy as before the October events and the elections.  As it turns out, it is even harder.    Can it be that Gaydar, whose intellect is equal to the sum  of  all three presidential analytical centers now undergoing reform,  did not realise this? Can it be that his resignation was  predetermined even before the December elections?    Let us suppose that Gaydar will stay in the government, or  return to it. What will this change? It is extremely difficult  to carry out a liberal economic policy today given the present  composition of the government. The combination of Gaydar,  Zaveryukha, Soskovets, and Chubays produces, in Yegor  Timurovich's own words, ""an indeterminate state."" Economically  irresponsible decisions -- for which, as always, no one knows  who answers -- brought about the ""breakdown"" of this politician,  dubbed in journalists' circles ""the Iron Winnie the Pooh."" Even  ""iron"" politicians have emotions.    It is quite another matter that the presence of Gaydar in  the  government, given his entirely understandable unwillingness to  take responsibility for inflationary decisions, in itself might  have become a factor maintaining the reformist line in a more or  less acceptable form. But Gaydar is going to the Duma. And  here there is an element not only of emotions but normal  political tactics. However, will the economic price of this  tactic -- a budget deficit -- not be too high? And has not too  high a price for the elections already been paid in a political  sense?    As Gaydar himself once remarked, a government of like-minded  individuals is a rare phenomenon. Such a government arises in  specific situations, such as, for example, the situation of  November 1991. Is not Gaydar preparing to return to the  government in precisely such a situation -- but to a homogeneous  rather than a coalition government?    There are two fundamentally different tactics for the  reformers. The first is to remain in the government and carry  out their promises: 5-7 percent inflation by the end of the  year, financial stabilization, ensuring a favorable climate for  investments, slowing the production slump and gradually boosting  production -- but not by printing money.    Taking account of the emerging composition of the  government,  the hints of a soft reorientation of economic policy, and the  gamble of the cabinet's conservative wing on economic populism,  the reformers cannot be confident that it will be possible to  fulfill this program. Naturally, they have no desire to share  responsibility for economic failures with the proinflationists.  Which means that they have to leave the government -- that is  the second tactical option. And not simply leave, but become  parliamentary oppositionists and criticize expenditure  decisions, pumping money into production sectors, growing  hyperinflation, and other such socialist ""measures"" that will  inevitably follow their resignations.    No one knows how events will develop. Which of the reformers  will remain ""hostages"" in the government is also not yet clear.  It cannot be ruled out that the logic of reforms will again  return key reformers to Chernomyrdin's cabinet, as happened in  1993.    In the final analysis, it is too early to speak about a  reorientation of the policy and the views of the incumbent  premier -- after Yeltsin the second most notable political  figure of the past year. It also cannot be ruled out that  another team of reformers will take over the executive levers --  we all know which team I am talking about.    Complex political horse-trading lies ahead. All the same,  the last word will probably belong to the president.     "
0,FT931-11108 ,"FT931-11108 _AN-DBDCDAFJFT 930204   FT  04 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Major outlines agenda of change      By RALPH ATKINS      A CONSERVATIVE agenda for change   to the benefit system, education, housing, transport, crime policy and to the honours system - was set out last night by Mr John Major, combining economic liberalism with a reinforcing of 'the social cement that binds us together'. The prime minister said his beliefs would have been familiar to Burke, Disraeli and Salisbury. He wanted to foster 'a national life in which merit is rewarded, achievement respected, opportunity opened up and the individual given power and choice. That is what I mean by a 'classless society'.' His speech at the Carlton Club, London, stressed the importance of change because, 'if we cling to outdated habits, rules and restrictions, we risk the collapse of our economy and society'. But he also wanted Britain to keep its links with the past: 'Some say that the glories of British history, the plays and sonnets of Shakespeare, the works of Dickens and Trollope - even poor old Winnie the Pooh - are irrelevant to the modern child . . . The destruction they have wrought has been physical as well as emotional.' In an apparent reference to the royal family, he said: 'Recently, the institutions that embodied our nationhood have come under attack: institutions in whose name our countrymen and women have been ready to make the ultimate sacrifice of their lives. I sense a growing fear that we may lose so much that is precious to this country.' He added later that, as the year 2000 approaches, 'we need more than ever that anchor of past experience and those institutions which give continuity and a framework to our national life - the monarchy, Parliament, our churches and voluntary organisations.' Mr Major welcomed the fact that 'the days when people could be considered somehow superior because of who they were, and not what they were, are finally fading into history.' He wanted to end barriers between blue collar and white collar and to raise the esteem of vocational qualifications. The honours system would be developed, 'to get rid of old, class-based distinctions' and reward volunteers. Conservatives were wary of over-government and unlike socialists did not see the free market as a threat, he said. 'It is not where the free market pervades that ties of community are under threat, but where the state owns and controls to the greatest extent. Look at our suburbs and small towns and villages - where people, by and large, own their own homes. . . The big problem lies elsewhere. It is from the inner cities, where the state is dominant, that businesses have fled.' He said rising crime had to be tackled. Change was needed in the police force: 'The crucial test of our police forces is their ability to deliver what the citizen wants: safety on our streets and security in their homes.' New powers to take persistent young offenders off the streets and into secure accommodation would be announced. On the economy, Mr Major said: 'If we are to sustain sound public finance and make progress towards our goals of lower personal taxation we must keep firm control of inflation and take a rigorous approach to public spending. It is always dangerously easy for the state to settle into habits of spending which outlast their purpose and outrun their budgets.' In housing, good private landlords had to be encouraged: 'But most young people still want to own their own home, and Conservatives believe strongly in helping them fulfil that ambition. I want more of them to have that choice.' The government had already opened the way to privately financed infrastructure projects. He wanted to 'investigate still more radical ways of financing a better road network between our cities.' Mr Major added: 'I increasingly wonder whether paying unemployment benefit, without offering or requiring any activity in return, serves unemployed people or society well. 'Of course, we have to make sure that any conditions imposed improve the job prospects of unemployed people and give good value to the country. But we have already introduced this principle, for example through Restart, in a limited sense for the long-term unemployed. I believe we should explore ways of extending it further.' He did not under-estimate the difficulties of change - 'giving people more freedom means giving people the opportunity to make mistakes,' he said. But it had been 'the genius of our party that we fashion change in the image of our long traditions.'   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Poindexter acknowledged during the  height of the Iran-Contra scandal that he had discussed the covert operation  regularly with Lt. Col. Oliver L. North and could have stopped it, an FBI agent  testified Thursday.    But Poindexter had denied any direct involvement in the affair, putting the  blame squarely on North, said FBI agent Ellen Glasser, who interviewed  Poindexter in his suburban home in 1986.    Even so, the agent's account was damaging to Poindexter, the retired rear  admiral who is being tried on one count of joining North in a conspiracy to  divert profits from Iran arms sales to the Contras in Nicaragua and on four  counts of obstructing and lying to Congress.    Glasser also testified that more than 5,000 messages were hurriedly deleted  from Poindexter's computer just before the White House forced his resignation  as the Iran-Contra affair developed into a major scandal for the Ronald Reagan  Administration in November, 1986.    Although he allowed Glasser to continue testifying, U.S. District Judge Harold  H. Greene was clearly troubled by the agent's failure to inform Poindexter that  he was being interviewed as a potential suspect in a criminal investigation.    Glasser, who has worked for the FBI for eight years, told the court that she  and another agent arrived at Poindexter's home on Nov. 28, 1986, three days  after his resignation, to determine whether any National Security Council  documents were kept in his home safe.    None were found, Glasser said, but she took the opportunity to talk with  Poindexter in his living room in the presence of his wife and the other FBI  agent.    Poindexter told Glasser that he had ""no working knowledge"" of the arms  shipments that the Administration had made to Iran in hopes of obtaining the  release of American hostages held by Iran-influenced Islamic fundamentalists in  Lebanon, the agent testified.    When asked about the diversion of profits from the arms sales to the Contras,  Poindexter ""stated that he had no direct knowledge of this, but said that  Oliver North was on his staff, was committed to the Contras and was up to  something,"" Glasser testified.    Poindexter, the agent went on, said ""that he discussed it with him regularly  and he said he could have stopped Ollie.""    But, asked whether he knew of any destruction of documents at the National  Security Council, ""he said he did not,"" Glasser testified.    Glasser said that she took no notes while talking with Poindexter for 15  minutes or so but that she pulled out a legal pad from her briefcase when she  got into the FBI car outside the Poindexter home and wrote everything down.    Greene questioned Glasser closely about whether she had any right to interview  Poindexter, the highest-ranking Reagan Administration official to be tried in  the Iran-Contra affair.    ""I think it was safe to say that we were investigating him as a potential  suspect,"" she replied.    But Greene, in a series of questions, drew from her the admission that the FBI  agents had never told that to Poindexter.    In their testimony Thursday, Glasser and Kelly Williams, a former Army computer  expert, described a feverish but ultimately futile attempt to erase almost all  the messages from the computers of Poindexter and North before their ouster  from the White House.    Although deleted, these messages eventually were recovered from a backup tape  that the White House Communications Agency kept of all traffic on White House  computers. Some of the messages are part of the evidence in Poindexter's trial.    Glasser testified that, although Poindexter's computer had more than 5,000  messages in its files on Nov. 22, 1986, ""by 9 a.m. on Nov. 24, there were zero  messages left."" That was a day before the White House asked for his  resignation.    Kelly testified that the messages in North's computer were reduced from 737 to  only one during the week of Nov. 22, 1986. North was dismissed on Nov. 25.    That one remaining message, Kelly said, was a small note from Poindexter that  authorized North to communicate directly with his boss without going through  channels.    Before Thursday's testimony began, special prosecutor Dan K. Webb told Greene  that he had decided to call fewer witnesses than originally planned and  probably would rest his case by Monday.    ""I hadn't the foggiest idea of how much information we could get from Oliver  North in his four days of testimony,"" the prosecutor said.    But, he said, North had revealed to the jury ""the fabric of Iran-Contra,"" and  it would not be necessary to call such witnesses as retired Air Force Maj. Gen.  Richard V. Secord, who ran some of the operations for North.    At one point Thursday, defense attorney Joseph Small demanded a mistrial,  accusing the prosecution of altering a document that was presented as a trial  exhibit.    Greene refused the request when he discovered that the exhibit had not been  altered by the government, and he lectured Small sternly.    ""I don't want you to try that stunt again,"" the judge said. ""People don't get  up in my court and accuse other counsel . . . of bad faith or misconduct unless  there's a pretty good case for it.""

Glasser, who has worked for the FBI for eight years, told the court that she  and another agent arrived at Poindexter's home on Nov. 28, 1986, three days  after his resignation, to determine whether any National Security Council  documents were kept in his home safe.    None were found, Glasser said, but she took the opportunity to talk with  Poindexter in his living room in the presence of his wife and the other FBI  agent.    Poindexter told Glasser that he had ""no working knowledge"" of the arms  shipments that the Administration had made to Iran in hopes of obtaining the  release of American hostages held by Iran-influenced Islamic fundamentalists in  Lebanon, the agent testified.    When asked about the diversion of profits from the arms sales to the Contras,  Poindexter ""stated that he had no direct knowledge of this, but said that  Oliver North was on his staff, was committed to the Contras and was up to  something,"" Glasser testified.    Poindexter, the agent went on, said ""that he discussed it with him regularly  and he said he could have stopped Ollie.""    But, asked whether he knew of any destruction of documents at the National  Security Council, ""he said he did not,"" Glasser testified.    Glasser said that she took no notes while talking with Poindexter for 15  minutes or so but that she pulled out a legal pad from her briefcase when she  got into the FBI car outside the Poindexter home and wrote everything down.    Greene questioned Glasser closely about whether she had any right to interview  Poindexter, the highest-ranking Reagan Administration official to be tried in  the Iran-Contra affair.    ""I think it was safe to say that we were investigating him as a potential  suspect,"" she replied.    But Greene, in a series of questions, drew from her the admission that the FBI  agents had never told that to Poindexter.    In their testimony Thursday, Glasser and Kelly Williams, a former Army computer  expert, described a feverish but ultimately futile attempt to erase almost all  the messages from the computers of Poindexter and North before their ouster  from the White House.    Although deleted, these messages eventually were recovered from a backup tape  that the White House Communications Agency kept of all traffic on White House  computers. Some of the messages are part of the evidence in Poindexter's trial.    Glasser testified that, although Poindexter's computer had more than 5,000  messages in its files on Nov. 22, 1986, ""by 9 a.m. on Nov. 24, there were zero  messages left."" That was a day before the White House asked for his  resignation.    Kelly testified that the messages in North's computer were reduced from 737 to  only one during the week of Nov. 22, 1986. North was dismissed on Nov. 25.    That one remaining message, Kelly said, was a small note from Poindexter that  authorized North to communicate directly with his boss without going through  channels.    Before Thursday's testimony began, special prosecutor Dan K. Webb told Greene  that he had decided to call fewer witnesses than originally planned and  probably would rest his case by Monday.    ""I hadn't the foggiest idea of how much information we could get from Oliver  North in his four days of testimony,"" the prosecutor said.    But, he said, North had revealed to the jury ""the fabric of Iran-Contra,"" and  it would not be necessary to call such witnesses as retired Air Force Maj. Gen.  Richard V. Secord, who ran some of the operations for North.    At one point Thursday, defense attorney Joseph Small demanded a mistrial,  accusing the prosecution of altering a document that was presented as a trial  exhibit.    Greene refused the request when he discovered that the exhibit had not been  altered by the government, and he lectured Small sternly.    ""I don't want you to try that stunt again,"" the judge said. ""People don't get  up in my court and accuse other counsel . . . of bad faith or misconduct unless  there's a pretty good case for it.""

The trainers, led by a brigadier and including three RAF  [Royal Air Force] members, are part of an expected expansion of  Britain's military and commercial ties with South Africa.  British contractors are ready to strike deals in avionics,  shipbuilding and technical training.    British security interests are expected to increase  significantly throughout southern Africa; military trainers are  already working in several countries in the region and Mr  Mandela, the President-elect, has indicated that South Africa  might return to the Commonwealth.    South African and British officials regard the appointment  of  Mr Joe Modise as South African Defence Minister as indicating  that Mr Mandela intends to maintain a strong defence force which  could help the United Nations throughout southern Africa.    South African officials suggest the renewal of military  links  with Britain would be at the expense of Pretoria's ties with  Israel, which has helped maintain South Africa's high-technology  weapons industries.    South Africa is making a determined effort to sell Britain  its new Rooivalk attack helicopter. The Ministry of Defence has  allowed the Rooivalk to be officially entered as another serious  contender, along with American and European firms, for a 1  billion pound contract for up to 91 helicopters.    It will be demonstrated in Britain for the first time this  week at the Army Air Corps air show at Middle Wallop, Hants.     "
0,FT924-7492 ,"FT924-7492 _AN-CKPBQAD0FT 921116   FT  16 NOV 92 / Two schools for scandal: Europe      By IAN DAVIDSON   With the eruption of the Matrix Churchill scandal over the illicit supply of machine tools to Iraq in the late 1980s, the British government is effortlessly breaking all records for a run of self-inflicted political disasters. Needless to say, the opposition has seized on the opportunity to give vent to a gale of histrionic indignation; and the government has felt obliged to set up a judicial inquiry under Lord Justice Scott. Such portentousness is overdone. Political hypocrisy requires an investigation, perhaps; but the investigation is unlikely to reveal much we do not already know. Moreover, the investigation will not be able to pin responsibility on one or more 'guilty men'; and it will not prevent similar incidents from recurring. Like the opposition, the government is just playing to the gallery; but the script of the melodrama is all too predictable. Political scandals in France tend to be more entertaining. This may be because they have more experience in the making of scandals; or because their scandals are more intriguing; or because they sometimes break with tantalising slowness; but whatever the reason, the French usually manage to put on a better, or at least a more varied, show. Of the numerous French political affairs in recent years, one stands out as a rather close parallel to the Matrix Churchill story. During the Gulf war of the 1980s, the French government had declared a ban on military sales to Iran. But in 1987 it emerged that Luchaire, a French manufacturer of artillery shells, had sold about 500,000 of them to Iran over a four-year period, from 1982 to 1986; moreover, it had got around the export ban with the connivance of key officials in the administration. The government duly set up a judicial inquiry; but two years later the investigating judge closed it down, without a finding or a conclusion, 'for lack of evidence'. Since the essential evidence could only have been withheld by the administration itself, this showed brazen chutzpah on the part of the government. The more spectacular Greenpeace affair was handled rather differently. In 1986 French secret agents sank the ship Rainbow Warrior in harbour in New Zealand, to prevent it from intruding on the French nuclear test site in the Pacific; the explosion inadvertently killed a Portuguese photographer on board. Two agents were offered as scapegoats to New Zealand, but no one in the government took political responsibility. Only after a long and unseemly struggle behind the scenes was Mr Charles Hernu, the defence minister, compelled to resign. Mr Bernard Tricot, a grand panjandrum of the French establishment, was wheeled out of retirement to investigate; but his report found that no one was to blame. As Liberation said at the time: 'Tricot washes whiter.' The idea of ministerial irresponsibility was implicit in the government's handling of the Luchaire scandal; but in the case of the Habash affair, it was raised to the level of an absolute principle. In January of this year, the radical Palestinian leader, Mr Georges Habash, was admitted to hospital in Paris for treatment. President Francois Mitterrand ill-advisedly blew this up into a scandalous error of policy, on account of Habash's one-time links with terrorism. But no minister could be found to carry the can; so five top-ranking civil servants were summarily fired, including Mr Francois Scheer, the head of the foreign ministry. It turned out, however, that this tactic of scapegoatism was no more than a piece of theatre. Even as he was firing Mr Scheer, President Mitterrand publicly praised him as a most valuable public servant; and within six months he had been found another top job, as ambassador to the European Community. That is the kind of denouement which calls for a spectacular spirit of insolence towards the voters. One reason for the French practice of ministerial irresponsibility is the power of the presidency. If the president is the ultimate source of power and political legitimacy, it follows that his ministers are little more than his executants. He may fire them; they do not resign on principle. So it is all the more striking that President Mitterrand has just restored the principle of ministerial responsibility, in the most sensational way possible. In 1985, the official French blood transfusion service supplied up to 1,500 haemophiliacs with blood which it knew to be infected with Aids or hepatitis. Ten days ago, the head of the service was sent to prison for four years. But last week Mr Mitterrand electrified France by calling, in effect, for parliamentary impeachment of the ministers responsible. It seems likely the list will include Mr Laurent Fabius, who was prime minister at the time; but since he has long been regarded as Mr Mitterrand's chosen heir, such a reversal of policy is dramatic indeed. The explanation for the apparent reversal is not far to seek. The Greenpeace affair happened far away to other people; selling arms to the enemy as part of the export drive can be kissed off as part of the world of realpolitik; and the Habash scandal was not really a scandal at all. But the contaminated blood has caused, or will cause, hundreds of deaths in France; that is a real scandal, not just one of the games governments play.  The Financial Times   London Page 34  "

The decision of the Central Committee was further made  conditional upon the final formulations for provisions for the  existence of the Zulu Kingdom and the role of His Majesty being  agreed to through mediation.    In a series of meetings which took place on Sunday, Monday  and today final agreement was reached securing the Kingdom of  KwaZulu and the role of His Majesty. I therefore am pleased to  announce that the Inkatha Freedom Party will contest elections  at the national and the provincial levels.    The entry of the IFP into national and regional levels will  be made possible by suitable amendments to ballot papers and  there will be certain relaxations to the procedures laid down  for the registration of parties and the publication of electoral  lists. I am pleased to announce that the TEC [Transitional  Executive Council] and the IEC [Independent Electoral  Commission] have promised their full co-operation to make the  IFP's entry into elections possible.    The Inkatha Freedom Party has decided to make the kind of  compromises which will make its entry into elections possible in  order to avoid a great deal more bloodshed and carnage which we  have been witness to in recent months.    Only the IFP held firm to principles right until the very  last moment and did everything in its power to eliminate the  very worst elements of the 1993 constitution. The best in the  constitution can be attributed to the IFP's interventions and  the long struggle it waged to ensure that the country benefited  from a constitution which will lay the foundations for a  democratic future.    Central to the IFP's concerns were the need to ensure viable  regional government with the minimum interference by the state.  It is to this end that the IFP finally managed to negotiate a  secure role for His Majesty the king of the Zulu nation and the  guarantee of the future existence of the Zulu Kingdom.    In securing these things the IFP has guaranteed that  provincialism in the kwaZulu-Natal province will set standards  which other provinces will be encouraged to adopt in their own  search for their provincial constitutional futures.    The IFP had previously succeeded in securing amendments to  the 1993 constitution which will enable provinces to adopt  constitutions of their own choice. The IFP also secured the  right of provinces to adopt constitutions which will not be  confined by the structures laid down for provinces in the 1993  constitution.    The IFP's negotiation victory in securing the role of His  Majesty the king of the Zulu nation and the continued existence  of the Kingdom of kwaZulu is therefore a victory for the  principle of self- determination from which the whole country  will benefit.    I wish to convey my deep gratitude to Professor Washington  Okumu for the role he played in making it possible to reach the  agreement which will result in the IFP entering elections. He  was an additional appointment as adviser to the international  mediating team and remained on in South Africa when the other  mediators left for their various international destinations. It  was his personal intervention which made the final negotiation  breakthrough possible.    When my spirits were down after the international mediation  had been aborted, and I was leaving Johannesburg for Ulundi on  Friday, April 15, I received a message at the airport from  Professor Washington Okumu that he wanted to meet me at the  airport and would be there in 20 minutes.    I have known Professor Okumu for more than 20 years having  met him at a prayer breakfast in Washington and we have kept in  touch on the basis of Christian fellowship.    I waited at Lanseria Airport for as long as I could on the  morning of April 15th for Professor Okumu but as two of my  colleagues had an appointment with His Majesty the king I had to  leave. However, the aircraft has been air-borne for only a few  minutes when I was told there was a problem and we had to turn  back.    Fortunately Professor Okumu was still there and I said that  it was as though God has prevented me from leaving, and I was  there like Jonah brought back. I told Professor Okumu that my  forced return was a God-send.    He insisted that everything should be done to try and see if  lost mediation could be retrieved and that I should do  everything I could to negotiate even at this late hour the IFP's  participation in elections.    I shared with Professor Okumu the IFP's problems--the fact  that the IFP took a decision not to participate because of its  serious concerns regarding His Majesty the king which had not  been met, and that I could not disregard that. If I did so, I  would be committing treason.    Professor Okumu said that everything notwithstanding, he was  going to see Mr Mandela, whom he has known a long time as well  as President de Klerk.    I had hardly arrived back in Ulundi on Friday when Professor  Okumu telephoned and said he had been in touch with the  government who said they were quite prepared to look at the  concerns I expressed. Professor Okumu was very firm and said I  should telephone the state president at 3 o'clock that afternoon.    Before I did so, the state president telephoned and asked me  what it was I wanted to say to him. I said that I gathered from  Professor Okumu that he wanted to talk to me and I gave him the  background. The state president told me that the issue of the  IFP's participation was sympathetically looked at by the  government. They were prepared to look at participation on a  regional level but I told the state president that there was no  way the IFP would participate at regional level only--the IFP  had support all over South Africa. The state president said he  was quite prepared to look at the possibilities.    I said the only way this could be done was if the issue of  His Majesty the king was addressed. The state president said a  special session of Parliament could be called to effect  amendments to the 1993 constitution. I reminded the state  president that His Majesty said he wanted matters dealt with  before elections.    On Saturday Professor Okumu telephoned again. On Sunday we  met in Durban where we both were attending the Jesus rally  organised by Africa Enterprise. Professor Okumu gave me a draft  of a proposed agreement which could be entered into between  myself, the president of the ANC and the South African  Government. The draft incorporated many of the answers to our  needs and I gave my provisional approval to it.    Professor Okumu said he was flying to Cape Town to talk to  Mr  Mandela. I showed the draft to Mr Jacob Zuma and Minister Danie  Schutte who were also at the rally, before I put it before the  Central Committeebecause that is the way I exercise my  leadership--referring all crucial matters to the Central  Committee which is the final decision-making body between  general conferences.    By arrangement with the state president I met him in  Pretoria  yesterday the 18th April. I was pleasantly surprised to find  the draft agreement had been shown to Mr Mandela who said he  wanted to study it for clarification.    After further negotiations the draft agreement with the  necessary amendments was accepted by myself, Mr Mandela and Mr  de Klerk.    I wish to pay tribute to Professor Okumu. He is a really  remarkable man who studied under Dr Kissinger at Harvard. I pay  tribute to the shuttle diplomacy he initiated and what has been  achieved through it.    I wish also to pay tribute to both President FW de Klerk and  Mr Mandela for the fact that they were receptive to the  suggestions made to the three of us by Professor Okumu.    I believe that as a result of the signing of this memorandum  of understanding, South Africa may well have been saved from  disastrous consequences of unimaginable proportions and has been  put on a course which I hope will lead to longlasting peace,  democracy and meaningful federalism.

He later  struck a plea-bargain agreement under which he has begun to detail an elaborate  fraud, Israeli Radio reported.    Following up on Dotan's testimony, authorities Tuesday arrested another officer  in the quartermaster corps, Col. Yitzhak Sar, on charges of taking bribes and  obstructing earlier investigations, official sources said. Israeli Defense  Minister Moshe Arens on Wednesday ordered a full inquiry into the scandal,  according to the Israeli Embassy in Washington.    One American company cited in Israeli press accounts is General Electric, which  supplied jet engines for Israel's version of the F-16 fighter plane. A GE  spokesman confirmed the firm is ""aware of an investigation by the Israeli  government"" and is conducting its own investigation.    An official source said FBI agents are trying to determine whether U.S.  citizens or companies violated American laws in the case.

0,FT943-4553 ,"FT943-4553 _AN-EIHDIADHFT 940908   FT  08 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Japanese equities   It may be wrong to pin the blame for yesterday's fall in the Tokyo market on the 5 per cent fall in Japan Telecom's share price. But the issue's high-profile flop has certainly put the Japanese system for pricing equity offerings under the spotlight. Japan Telecom was designed to appeal to foreigners. There is a danger that it will instead reinforce investor suspicions that buying new Japanese equity is a quick way to lose money. Japan's system for pricing issues was introduced following the Recruit share scandal of the late 1980s. Then the problem was that new issues typically shot to handsome premiums and so companies could reward their friends by allocating them shares. But in combating corruption, the current system has brought its own problems. The main difference between the Japanese system and the 'bookbuilding' process used in most international equity issues is that the price is set through an auction near the start of the offering period rather than near the end. The delay between pricing an issue and trading means the share price is a hostage to wider market movements. Investors also have less time to analyse a stock before placing their bids. Japan Telecom is due to be followed by several other large issues. Japan Tobacco is next in line and two railway companies, JR West and JR Central, are expected next year. It is too late to alter the system for the Tobacco sale. But if future flotations are to attract foreign investors, Tokyo will need to bring its issuing practices closer to international standards.

0,FT922-3275 ,"FT922-3275 _AN-CFLAVABFFT 920612   FT  12 JUN 92 / Arts: Dejavu - Theatre      By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD   Just over 25 years on, John Osborne has done it again. Dejavu is not Look Back in Anger, but it has every claim to become the most talked about play in London. The only reservation apart from the length - a good three hours - and the uncertainty about how to bring it to an end is whether you need to know the earlier piece in order to enjoy the latter. My guess is that Dejavu just about stands in its own right. Osborne has forgotten nothing since the height of his powers. A quarter of a century later, Jimmy Porter and Cliff are still there, relatively affluent and with Jimmy tending to be known as JP. But instead of Alison, Jimmy's wife, there is now Alison, his daughter, and instead of Helena, his wife's friend, there is now Helena, the friend of his daughter. The rest of the plot is much the same, right down to the use of the ironing board and the switch of allegiance. Apart from the sheer pleasure of seeing Look Back revisited, there are two fundamental reasons why this production by Tony Palmer works so well. One is that Osborne at his best is such a brilliant stage-writer: the words and the allusions come tumbling out, joke after joke. The other is that this Jimmy Porter - the ageing John Osborne in all but name - is played by the youngish actor, Peter Egan. This is crucial to the success. It means that even when JP is at his most cantankerous and bilious, he still has a youthful charm. The danger of playing him like a stereotype - angry young man turned reactionary fogey - has been avoided. Although Egan appears to get through enormous quantities of red wine and champagne in the course of the show, it never seems that it is wholly the drink that is talking. This is Porter Senior reflecting on Porter Junior: curiously enough he tends to the conclusion that the generation of the 1950s had it better. Jimmy looks younger than Cliff (Gareth Thomas), as perhaps he always was at heart. What they still have in common, however, is the ability to turn on a double act. The two man cabaret show is at the heart of their performance. Where Osborne scores, just as he did in Look Back and also in The Entertainer, is in mixing the corniest of old music hall jokes with the most literary. Some of the awfullest old lines are repeated, like 'my feet hurt' - 'why not try washing your socks?' Then we are off with 'Auntie Wordsworth'. Osborne's language is steeped in Shakespeare. Remember that team of comics, Jock and Day, who stood tiptoe on the misty mountain top? This mock-literary stuff is the preferred home of Jimmy and Cliff. They were, as one of them says in Dejavu, camp before anyone knew what it meant. There are also the Osborne swipes at fashionable trends. JP has become a wine snob, and uses the language to dismiss the Nicaragua '89. In the Osborne world there is now an A level in joined-up writing; for GCSEs you do Elton John since nobody has heard of TS Eliot. The local shopping precinct is called after Winnie Mandela. But the style is not repetitive because the jokes are so infinitely varied. There is a lot more besides. The Sunday papers are back: Osborne claims not unfairly to have invented the category 'posh'. The bears and squirrels of Look Back now appear regularly in the Valentine's Day messages in The Times. If the earlier work was seminal, this is an essential catch-up.

In a radio interview given just two weeks before he is due to leave for the Group of Seven economic summit and for bilateral talks in Tokyo, Mr Clinton expressed little sympathy for Japan's government turmoil, putting it down to a long legacy of political scandal and corruption. 'It's pretty clear to me', he said, 'that no matter who winds up being prime minister of Japan, or whatever faction that person comes from, they're going to have to continue to open their economy to our products.' He added, echoing a consistent theme of US policy over recent weeks: 'They're going to have to continue to stimulate their economy because they don't have a budget deficit.' In an apparent attempt to encourage the internationalist strain among Japanese politicians, he went on: 'They can't withdraw from the world or shut us out now. They've got too much at stake in expanding into China and other countries and in doing business in a very complicated world.' He expected his bilateral talks to be 'challenging' but 'successful, simply because of the limits on their economic options'. Senior officials from both governments are due to hold the second round of negotiations on the proposed new bilateral 'framework' in Tokyo this weekend, following the first session in Washington 10 days ago. That produced no breakthrough, and US officials had not expected one, but the collapse of Mr Kiichi Miyazawa's government has raised new doubts about whether the whole process will now be able to go through on schedule.

The four --  State President F W de Klerk, Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] leader  Mangosuthu Buthelezi, Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini and African  National Congress President Nelson Mandela -- began their talks  at 3.30PM and there was no indication when the meeting would end.    A large contingent of journalists were restricted to the  Skukuza area as they were not allowed into the Jakkalsbessie  Camp, the venue for the talks, government spokesman Marius  Kleynhans said.    King Zwelithini was at Skukuza on Thursday night, while Mr  Mandela, Mr Buthelezi and Mr de Klerk arrived on Friday morning.    The ANC leader and the Zulu king met from 9.30AM to 2PM, Mr  Kleynhans said.    King Goodwill's delegation included about 20 indunas  [chiefs], and the ANC was represented by Secretary-General Cyril  Ramaphosa, Executive Committee member Mac Maharaj and Communist  Party Chairman Joe Slovo.    The four leaders met to discuss the future of kwaZulu/Natal,  violence, and whether elections would be possible in the  province.    Journalists battled to file stories as only one pay card  telephone line was available at Skukuza for the media.    While the government and other delegations earlier refused  to  disclose the venue of the talks, the SABC [South African  Broadcasting Corporation] had advance notice and arrived at  Skukuza with an outside broadcast truck to provide coverage of  the event.

This is contained in a  statement issued in Accra and signed by the co-chairman of the  party, Dr. Ako-Brew, congratulating President Nelson Mandela of  South Africa and the leader of the Inkatha Freedom Party, Chief  Mangosuthu Buthelezi, for ensuring successful elections in their  country.    The Egle Party also congratulates the outgoing president of  Malawi, Dr. Kamuzu Banda, for conceding defeat in his country's  presidential elections. According to the statement, the  examples of South Africa and Malawi should be a light to other  African countries where opposition parties, unable to accept  defeat in a free and fair election, have resorted to verbal and  physical violence to achieve political power.    The statement said whilst the NPP [New Patriotic Party] sent  congratulatory messages to political party leaders in South  Africa, who have made true dialogue a cornerstone of their  politics, the same party has backed out of dialogue here at  home. The statement said having failed to participate in  elections which would have given it a presence in parliament,  the NPP is doing everything it can to obstruct and discourage  investments, undermine and discredit the government, and sow  seeds of discord in the country. Whilst reminding the NPP of  the proverb that charity begins at home, the statement urges all  political parties to prevent the events in Liberia, Burundi,  Rwanda, Somalia, and Angola from happening in Ghana.

The decision was taken at a special cabinet meeting on  Monday  morning in the midst of a civil service strike that is  threatening to cripple the homeland. President Lucas Mangope  went from the meeting to a government building where he was due  to address striking teachers and health workers.    Earlier he told strikers that if they wanted to continue  their strike they should go home. Only government workers at  management level had remained at their posts by Monday  lunchtime, a government source said. The strikers are demanding  that their pensions be paid out and that Bophuthatswana be  re-incorporated into South Africa.    Bophuthatswana's decision does not necessarily disqualify  its  ruling Christian Democratic Party from participating in the  elections. Both government and African National Congress  President Nelson Mandela have indicated the deadline for  registration could be shifted. However, the Independent  Electoral Commission has said practical considerations made late  registrations difficult.    Bophuthatswana arrived at its decision as its Freedom  Alliance partners -- the Inkatha Freedom Party and the Afrikaner  Volksfront [National Front] -- began meeting in Pretoria to  devise the alliance's approach to international mediation of  South Africa's constitutional dispute.

The meeting is against a background of a civil service  strike  that threatens to cripple the homeland as strikers demand the  return of their pension contributions and re-incorporation into  South Africa.    The cabinet must decide whether to register alongside its  Freedom Alliance partner, the Inkatha Freedom Party, and  Constand Viljoen's Freedom Front.    Although the Afrikaner Volksfront [National Front], of which  Gen Viljoen is chairman, decided on Saturday against  registration, the Freedom Front could still participate in the  elections. Attempts are being made to persuade moderates to  follow through with the registration.    Hopes for Bophuthatswana's inclusion in the electoral  process  were further boosted when African National Congress President  Nelson Mandela said in Pietersburg on Sunday that the deadline  for registration could be extended.    A spokesman for the Office of Minister of Constitutional  Development Roelf Meyer said on Monday that if the Independent  Electoral Commission [IEC] would accept the registration of  Bophuthatswana's ruling Christian Democratic Party on Monday  afternoon, ""the government will not obstruct that"". He said any  objection to the late registration would be based on practical  rather than political objections. ""Whatever the IEC can  accommodate, that will be okay with the government,"" the  spokesman said.

The September 1990 memo was prepared to brief Mr Dick Thornburgh, then the US attorney-general, before he telephoned Mr Henry Gonzalez, the House banking committte chairman who has spearheaded congressional inquiries into the BNL affair. The memo states: 'Our best attempt to thwart any further congressional inquiry by the House banking committee into this case is to have you contact Chairman Gonzalez directly.' Mr Gonzalez, a Texas Democrat, charged last night that the Justice Department had worked 'systematically' to prevent his probe of the Dollars 5bn (Pounds 2.9bn) of illegal Iraqi loans made by BNL's Atlanta branch. He disclosed yesterday that in 1990 he had refused to discuss the BNL case with Mr Thornburgh and went ahead with his investigation anyway. The House banking committee chairman also accused yesterday Mr William Barr, the current attorney-general who is a close aide to President George Bush, of withholding hundreds of documents from his investigation. He called for Mr Barr to resign over his handling of the BNL affair. Mr Gonzalez also released Justice Department documents which appear to show that Mr Joe Whitley, the top US prosecutor in Atlanta, had been involved in the management of the BNL case even though he had supposedly disqualified himself in 1990 because of a conflict of interest. The Justice Department declined to comment last night.  The Financial Times   London Page 9  "

The four executives were forced to step down after it was revealed that they had failed to inform the authorities immediately of false bids submitted by the firm's government bond trading desk. Under the terms of the settlements - which Salomon said had been reached in light of information about the executives' conduct in the Securities and Exchange Commission's recent report on the affair - Mr Thomas Strauss, the firm's former president and chief operating officer, has been allowed to exercise some of the stock options held by him when he left last August. Mr Strauss was also allowed to keep the benefits of compensation plans awarded before his resignation. Shares in his account in Salomon's equity partnership plan were bought from him at market prices. Mr John Meriwether, a former vice-chairman, was also allowed to receive payments from various compensation plans that pre-dated his resignation, and was awarded Dollars 8m extra compensation for his contribution to the firm's earnings in 1991. Additionally, Mr Meriwether surrendered his interest in the equity partnership plan in exchange for restricted stock and cash, and received about Dollars 1.7m to cover losses suffered when Salomon refused to allow him to exercise previously awarded stock options in November 1991, before all of the facts about the Treasury market scandal had been determined. Salomon said it had been unable to reach agreement with Mr John Gutfreund, its former chairman, and Mr Donald Feuerstein, the firm's former chief counsel, over their employment-related compensation claims.

By STANLEY MEISLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER      WASHINGTON      Oliver L. North testified Tuesday that his hapless and hazardous flight into  Tehran at the height of the Iran-Contra affair was originally conceived as an  advance trip to prepare the way for ""a senior Administration official --  perhaps even the vice president -- to meet with the leaders of Tehran.""    The testimony in the trial of retired Rear Adm. John M. Poindexter in U.S.  District Court was the first mention that anyone considered such a role for  then-Vice President George Bush.    But, when asked if Bush, as vice president, had been aware of North's  activities, the former Marine lieutenant colonel replied: ""Counsel, I don't  know which of the documents that I sent to Mr. Poindexter and Mr. McFarlane  were sent to the vice president's office."" Robert C. McFarlane was Poindexter's  predecessor as national security adviser.    North did acknowledge, as has been reported often, that Bush sent him a  congratulatory note on Thanksgiving Day in 1985 that praised North's work as  ""one of the many things I have to be thankful for.""    Poindexter, who resigned as President Ronald Reagan's national security adviser  in 1986, is charged with five counts involving a conspiracy to destroy  documents, obstruct investigations and lie to Congress in the worst scandal of  the Reagan Administration.    Adding a touch of derring-do to his testimony about the May, 1986, Tehran trip,  North also revealed that he had carried ""a covert listening device"" to  ""tape-record all of the meetings that I had with the Iranians and other  intermediaries."" North made the trip with McFarlane, who at the time was no  longer a government official.    The testimony about the Tehran flight was drawn out by Richard W. Beckler,  Poindexter's defense attorney, who spent most of the day trying to coax the  former national security officer into disassociating Poindexter from  responsibility for most of the shadowy intrigue during those days in the White  House. It was North's third day on the stand.    But, although he agreed that Poindexter did not work hand-in-hand with him or  telephone him every day, North insisted: ""I did keep the admiral apprised of  what I was doing.""    North, who was convicted last year of destroying documents and obstructing  Congress, organized a complex operation in which the profits from the sale of  arms to Iran were used to arm the Contras fighting in Nicaragua.    Recalling the Tehran flight served Beckler's purpose because North, in the  early stages of planning, had circumvented Poindexter by enlisting the support  of McFarlane. Beckler's questioning has made it clear that he is trying to put  much of the responsibility for the events on McFarlane, who pleaded guilty in  1988 to withholding information from Congress.    North testified that he had proposed a flight to Tehran with an advance party  to prepare the way for high-level negotiations with the Iranians that could  lead to freedom for the American hostages held by Iran-influenced Islamic  fundamentalists in Lebanon.    But ""the admiral was very opposed to an advance trip,"" North testified. ""He  believed the risk was too great. I believed the risk was worth it.""    Without informing Poindexter, North testified, he sent a message to McFarlane  in February, 1986, asking him ""to importune with the admiral to make the trip.""  Although McFarlane was no longer a government official, he still kept a  National Security Council computer terminal at home, and North could  communicate with him through its secret channels.    Explaining this odd arrangement, North told Judge Harold H. Greene: ""Mr.  McFarlane had started the (Iran) initiative; he had been involved in it from  the beginning, and it is my understanding that he stayed involved in it.""    The White House decided to allow the trip by North and McFarlane, who would try  to negotiate the release of hostages. By the time the trip was approved it was  no longer being considered as preparation for a visit by higher-level  officials.    Although no high Administration official was aboard the plane, McFarlane was  authorized to negotiate on behalf of the U.S. government. The May, 1986, trip,  however, was a disaster. McFarlane failed to obtain the release of any  hostages, and the flight itself inspired rumors that spread throughout the  Middle East and eventually led to public disclosures about the Iran-Contra  affair.    Although North, in his testimony, noted that the original planners thought of  the possibility of using the vice president in the negotiations, he did not  elaborate and was not questioned further about it. President Bush has  continually denied any involvement in the Iran-Contra affair.    Beckler was so circuitous in his attempts to induce North to relieve Poindexter  of responsibility in the scandal that his questioning seemed to trouble Greene  and lose the attention of the jury.    At first, Greene showed his patience. ""I have a lifetime appointment,"" he said,  ""and, if necessary, I can listen to Col. North until my term runs out.""    Later, he snapped: ""If it wasn't this kind of case with this much visibility, I  would have struck half of your questions."" He then warned Beckler that his  patience could not hold indefinitely. True to his threat, he then cut the  lawyer's questions off several times, pronouncing them irrelevant.

But, although he agreed that Poindexter did not work hand-in-hand with him or  telephone him every day, North insisted: ""I did keep the admiral apprised of  what I was doing.""    North, who was convicted last year of destroying documents and obstructing  Congress, organized a complex operation in which the profits from the sale of  arms to Iran were used to arm the Contras fighting in Nicaragua.    Recalling the Tehran flight served Beckler's purpose because North, in the  early stages of planning, had circumvented Poindexter by enlisting the support  of McFarlane. Beckler's questioning has made it clear that he is trying to put  much of the responsibility for the events on McFarlane, who pleaded guilty in  1988 to withholding information from Congress.    North testified that he had proposed a flight to Tehran with an advance party  to prepare the way for high-level negotiations with the Iranians that could  lead to freedom for the American hostages held by Iran-influenced Islamic  fundamentalists in Lebanon.    But ""the admiral was very opposed to an advance trip,"" North testified. ""He  believed the risk was too great. I believed the risk was worth it.""    Without informing Poindexter, North testified, he sent a message to McFarlane  in February, 1986, asking him ""to importune with the admiral to make the trip.""  Although McFarlane was no longer a government official, he still kept a  National Security Council computer terminal at home, and North could  communicate with him through its secret channels.    Explaining this odd arrangement, North told Judge Harold H. Greene: ""Mr.  McFarlane had started the (Iran) initiative; he had been involved in it from  the beginning, and it is my understanding that he stayed involved in it.""    The White House decided to allow the trip by North and McFarlane, who would try  to negotiate the release of hostages. By the time the trip was approved it was  no longer being considered as preparation for a visit by higher-level  officials.    Although no high Administration official was aboard the plane, McFarlane was  authorized to negotiate on behalf of the U.S. government. The May, 1986, trip,  however, was a disaster. McFarlane failed to obtain the release of any  hostages, and the flight itself inspired rumors that spread throughout the  Middle East and eventually led to public disclosures about the Iran-Contra  affair.    Although North, in his testimony, noted that the original planners thought of  the possibility of using the vice president in the negotiations, he did not  elaborate and was not questioned further about it. President Bush has  continually denied any involvement in the Iran-Contra affair.    Beckler was so circuitous in his attempts to induce North to relieve Poindexter  of responsibility in the scandal that his questioning seemed to trouble Greene  and lose the attention of the jury.    At first, Greene showed his patience. ""I have a lifetime appointment,"" he said,  ""and, if necessary, I can listen to Col. North until my term runs out.""    Later, he snapped: ""If it wasn't this kind of case with this much visibility, I  would have struck half of your questions."" He then warned Beckler that his  patience could not hold indefinitely. True to his threat, he then cut the  lawyer's questions off several times, pronouncing them irrelevant.

Dr Bandid Nijthavorn, the central bank's deputy director of  the Research Department, said if Thailand wants to develop  further as a financial centre and win recognition from the  international community, it must introduce legislation, similar  to that in Hong Kong or Singapore, to make money laundering  unlawful.    Bandid's remark, made yesterday at the Journalists  Association of Thailand, was the first time that the central  bank came out unequivocally in support of a money-laundering law.    The drug scandal surrounding MP Thanong Siriprechapong, who  was forced to resign, dealt a blow to the Thai Parliament and  Thailand was seen as a haven for money laundering.    The Chuan administration has come under domestic and  international pressure to introduce money-laundering  legislation. But Bandid said the legislation should not only  seek to curb illegal drug activities but also cover other  criminal acts and political corruption. [passage omitted]    Bandid said that old laws seeking to curb money laundering  are not broad enough to cover economic crimes, so it is  necessary to introduce a brand new money-laundering law, which  should seek to:    1. Penalize all individuals associated with money-laundering  activities as a criminal offence;    2. Require financial institutions to report to the  authorities unusual transactions;    3. Lay down the same system for all financial institutions  to  file reports of suspicious transactions.    Bandid cautioned that the legislation should not create  unwarranted burdens on the financial institutions.     "

Then, Zhou Ming, a Chinese swimming coach, rounded on western critics, saying: 'I think the doping problem is a sort of political problem now because in the sports world it's always the domain of western people. They just can't tolerate that Asian peoples can be good in sport.' But now the truth, of an epidemic of drug-taking among Chinese swimmers, is dribbling out. Reports appeared this week that eight of them tested positive at the recent Asian Games in Hiroshima, and statements from Beijing have become contrite. Officials are still finding ways of blaming the west. 'Illegal drug abuse in sport is originally a western invention, but since China opened its doors to the outside world 15 years ago, such a bad thing seeped into China, too, just like prostitution,' Mr Yuan Jiawei, deputy secretary general of China's swimming committee, said this week. It is a moot point whether the world's oldest profession was ever completely eradicated from China, but the scourge of drug-taking in sport has certainly found its way to the Middle Kingdom, Chinese protestations to the contrary. Now that the cat is out of the bag, Chinese officialdom is seeking to put the best complexion on things but the doping scandal is a considerable embarrassment for a country whose sporting aspirations are so entwined with its political and commercial ambitions. China lost face this week in the eyes of the world sporting fraternity and in the process its credibility was harmed in a broader sense, at a moment when it is seeking closer integration with the international community - from membership of world trade organisations such as Gatt to a more active role in arms control. All these international commitments rest to an extent on trust and playing by the rules. China is in the process of trying to convince a sceptical world it will uphold Gatt principles, and honour undertakings to continue liberalising its economy. 'This is the last thing they would have wanted at this stage since international sporting success is part of their attempts to build an image of a comprehensively successful and all-round China,' said a western official in Beijing this week. But the official also noted that the problem of drug-taking in sport is far from confined to China; although few other nations have suffered the embarrassment of having 11 of their athletes, including world-record breaking swimmers, involved in a doping scandal all at once. Before the latest reports emerged from Tokyo, drug-taking among Chinese swimmers had already become a problem. In the past two years five had tested positive, which equalled the number of positive tests by FINA, the international swimming federation, in the previous 22 years. Inevitably, suspicion that such champion swimmers as Lu Bin and Yang Aihua, gold medallists in Rome, had taken steroids is casting doubt over the performance of other Chinese athletes such as women distance runners who have re-written the record books in the past year. Ma Junren, the flamboyant Chinese athletics coach, claims that his 'army' of woman runners owe their outstanding performances to a potion made from crushed turtle, and other exotic ingredients, but rival athletes are sceptical. Compounding Beijing's embarrassment is the fact that at the Asian Games in early October, Chinese sports officials had prevailed on the 43-member Olympic Council of Asia to condemn the western media over the drug-taking allegations at the Rome swimming championships. Wei Jizhong, China's OCA delegate, welcomed the stand of fellow Asians, saying: 'We are happy that the other Asian countries have finally decided to support us.' China won 137 gold medals out of 337 events at the Asian games, more than double the tally of South Korea, its nearest competitor. Its women swimmers won all 15 of their races and set a number of world records in the process. Its women weightlifters dominated, setting 16 world records. China hailed the results in official commentaries as a 'resounding success', and singled out the women swimmers for special praise, saying their 'astonishing performances marked a shift in the balance in a sport which the west had dominated for decades'. Those performances seem somewhat less astonishing now.   Countries:-  CNZ  China, Asia.   Industries:-  P7941 Sports Clubs, Managers, and Promoters.   Types:-  NEWS  General News.

Judge Marvin Shoob declared in open court that he did not believe the central premise of the US government's case against Mr Christopher Drogoul, former BNL Atlanta manager, who was due to have been sentenced to prison this week. The judge's order was in response to a request by US government prosecutors, who this week suffered a series of blows to their case that Mr Drogoul was the sole orchestrator of the Iraqi loans. More than Dollars 2bn of these helped finance President Saddam Hussein's nuclear, chemical and missile projects. The prosecutors yesterday said they wished to seek a full trial and cancel an earlier plea agreement by which Mr Drogoul had admitted guilt to 60 of 347 charges against him. Two weeks ago, Mr Bobby Lee Cook, Mr Drogoul's lawyer, was refused a full trial and a request that his client's plea be changed to innocent. Mr Cook, who quickly agreed to a new trial, has accused the Bush administration of covering up its role in a scheme to finance Iraq's weapons programmes via BNL loans. The government's case appeared weakened this week after Judge Shoob had revealed that three CIA documents proved 'definitely' that Mr Drogoul had acted with the full knowledge of BNL's head office in Rome.

However, an independent expert  medical and ecological study is constantly being put off.

As from the beginning of February  the institute staff have been sent on indefinite, unpaid  vacation.    The absence of a clear state program for the destruction of  chemical weapons and the uncertainty about the Shikhany  facilities' participation in this process cannot but spawn new  rumors and add tension to the situation.

0,FT922-604 ,"FT922-604 _AN-CFZBBAFDFT 920626   FT  26 JUN 92 / Iran-Contra prosecutor probing at 'highest level'      By JUREK MARTIN, US Editor      WASHINGTON   FURTHER indictments in the Iran-Contra scandal could occur this summer, including charges against those at the highest level of President Reagan's government, according to Mr Lawrence Walsh, the US chief special prosecutor. In a report to Congress yesterday, Mr Walsh's office named no-one under suspicion for having sought to conceal the shipment of arms to Iran in 1985, which was intended to secure the release of hostages in Lebanon and the proceeds of which were used to finance the Nicaraguan Contra rebels, in contravention of a Congressional ban. Mr Caspar Weinberger, defence secretary in the Reagan administration, was charged last week by a grand jury with having lied about his knowledge of the arms shipments. He has subsequently pleaded innocent and the provisional date for his trial is the eve of the presidential election in early November. Mr Walsh's report hints that others of comparable seniority in the Reagan government might also be implicated, and that the investigation should be completed this summer. 'We are attempting to determine,' the report says, 'whether officials at the highest level of government, acting individually or in concert, sought to obstruct official inquiries into the Iran initiative  .. by supplying a false account of the 1985 arms sales from Israeli stocks.' The indictment against Mr Weinberger drew attention to a meeting on November 24 1986, attended by Mr Reagan, at which Mr Edwin Meese, then attorney-general, is said to have given the opinion that a shipment of Hawk missiles from Israel to Iran in 1985, though later authorised by the president, may have contravened the Arms Export Control Act.

He  interviewed the author in her home.      JOHANNESBURG, SOUTH AFRICA      It has been 40 years since the white Parliament passed the infamous laws  creating ""grand apartheid."" During that same year, the New Yorker published a  short story by an unknown 26-year-old South African.    That story launched a writing career that has reached a vast international  reading audience, angered successive white South African governments and earned  the author regular mention as a leading candidate for the Nobel Prize for  Literature.    Through a body of work that includes such novels as ""Burger's Daughter"" and  ""July's People,"" and the short-story collection ""Six Feet of the Country,""  Nadine Gordimer has painted a subtle, yet powerful portrait of the effect of  apartheid on the people who live in South Africa.    Gordimer, 66, still writes regularly on her manual Hermes typewriter, working  in a study of the suburban Johannesburg home she shares with her husband, an  art gallery owner. Her 17th book, a novel called ""My Son's Story,"" is due out  this fall. She spends more time these days encouraging young artists through  the Congress of South African Writers, a mostly black organization of 5,000  writers that she co-founded in 1987.    She is a small, gray-haired woman, only 5 foot 1 and 90 pounds, and a picture  of solemn concentration as she talks about her work and her life, even as the  family German pointer snores peacefully at her side. Playwright Athol Fugard  calls her ""fiercely uncompromising, uncomfortably uncompromising for a lot of  people.""    Her country has changed radically in a matter of months this year and, for the  first time, Gordimer says she has begun to feel more at home in this nation  that has been her lifelong home.    The African National Congress is legal again, after 30 years of waging a  guerrilla war from exile. Nelson Mandela, the man Gordimer considers her  political leader, is free and meets with President Frederik W. de Klerk. And  hardly a week goes by that Gordimer doesn't greet an old friend who has  returned from exile to rejoin the legal political process.    Gordimer joined the ANC the other day with her usual sense of quiet purpose.  She walked into a building near downtown Johannesburg, feeling a special warmth  in the rooms where she and her friends once met secretly. Then she filled out a  single-page form, pulled 12 rand (about $5) from her pocketbook and became a  card-carrying member.    It was the kind of simple scene that she might have used for one of her own  characters: the life-affirming act of a novelist who sees the future of which  she dreamed coming true.    ""I had waited a very long time. It was really quite moving,"" Gordimer said the  next day. ""I had been in and out of that office for years. It was such a nice,  familiar place for this kind of commitment to happen.""    Question: Must a writer in South Africa today be politically active?    Answer: I'm not by nature a political person at all. In the early '60s, I  couldn't even get up on a platform and express an opinion about literature . .  . . I was petrified. And I think if I had lived in another country, I would  have remained like that . . . .    My whole lifetime here, there has been this enormous struggle coming toward the  climax it reached in the past decade or so. And to stand aside from that and  say, ""No, I'm not going to pass an opinion on detentions. I'm not going to take  part in any type of protest against what happens here. I'm not going to speak  about anything."" Whether this is out of reticence or out of fear of the danger,  I don't think you can work here. I don't think you have a right to.    Q: What is the burden of a white person, and particularly a white artist, in  South Africa?    A: If you're a writer, you really need to be left alone. So the burden is that  you really can't be left alone. Whatever you do here, even if you just belong  to a writers' organization, it's all intensely politicized because culture is  intensely politicized . . . . It is a burden. I feel ashamed saying so, because  then you look at other people who really sacrifice all kinds of personal  fulfillment in order to bring about change.    Q: Is art itself a way to bring about change then?    A: That's a delicate matter. All literature is . . . trying to make sense of  life . . . . And if there's any honesty in a writer at all, any self-searching  in your society, it's going to be a (social) critique . . . .    You get involved in your society. You cannot just be a writer. You have to be a  citizen as well. But I think it's terribly important not to become a  propagandist, even for the cause that you believe in most. If you're going to  produce anything worthwhile, you must retain the freedom to write about that  society, warts and all . . . .    This does not mean you have to say you have . . . an ""evenhanded"" approach. I  don't think, in a society like ours, if you're honest and have any moral sense  at all or any decency, you can look at apartheid . . . in an evenhanded way. If  there's anything I am absolutely sure about in my life, it is that racism is  evil . . . . Nobody can defend it. It's pure evil. Therefore, how can you have  an evenhanded view of people who practice racism against those who try to  abolish it. So I think you keep your principles -- more than your principles,  you keep your strong passionate convictions -- about what is wrong. But in your  writing you must be free to show that even those who have passionate  convictions have human faults.    Q: Have writers had any influence on South African society?    A: I think South African fiction writers have had some influence . . . . But  one must be modest about it. In how many countries do writers have any real  influence? You now have this extraordinary happening in that (Vaclav) Havel is  president of a country. But . . . it's very rare. In most countries,  intellectuals have no influence whatever on governments . . . .    I think we have helped in the struggle to the extent that we have been able to  express the unspoken resentments, frustrations, fears, hates, loves of South  Africans, who because of the kind of climate of intimidation here have feared  to say these things openly . . . .    And maybe some whites have been stirred by our writings to examine their own  lives and have doubts about the way they've been acting. But . . . it's a small  influence.    But abroad, I think we have done quite a lot, because . . . in scenes of  violence on a TV screen or in a newspaper report, people's lives are shown at  that point. You don't know what happened before or what goes on afterward.  Whereas in a novel, in stories, you have a deeper view of people's lives. You  see what happened after the riot, what happened after they went home, what  happened to the parents when the child fled the country, went to Swaziland and  they didn't hear of their child for two or three years . . . . All these things  are the result of apartheid and what it does to people here. But you can't see  them in a newscast.    So I think those of us who are read overseas have really had the opportunity to  show the people more of a totality of what apartheid means in human terms.    Q: What's your feeling about the changes occurring inside South Africa today?  What do they mean for blacks in South Africa and why are they, as many say, not  enough?    A: Of course they're not enough. Now, one cannot say that the unbanning of the  liberation movements is insignificant. It was an enormous thing. I heard about  it . . . . I'll never forget the morning. . . . My two comrades in COSAW  (Congress of South African Writers) and I had been out . . . in Soweto.    . . . . We went to the room where Raks Seakgwa (COSAW regional organizer)  lives. He has an enormous TV, which I haven't got. So we sat in his room there  and watched . . . the speech. It was extraordinary because Raks spent five  years on Robben Island (prison). And the other young man, . . . as recently as  1988, spent a year in solitary confinement in detention. And they're such  extraordinary young men because they seemed to have no bitterness; they  accepted it as their part in the struggle for freedom . . . .    So . . . to hear the unbanning of the ANC . . . was for me extraordinary -- and  very humbling. They were absolutely bowled over. They couldn't believe it. So  you can't say that this is nothing.    (But) now all the awful things are happening. You see (President Frederik W.)  de Klerk maneuvering toward a new dispensation here with, from the point of  view of many white people, the most extraordinary concessions to black majority  rule. But I don't think they quite realized what this would bring about,  because it's brought about the resurgence of white Afrikaner fanaticism, racist  fanaticism . . . . (This is) something that dampens one's euphoria . . . .    But to look on the good side, the level at which Nelson Mandela and his group  have been received in the outside world is something that, of course, should  have happened long, long ago. When you think how many years the ANC was totally  ignored by the West, I think it's terribly important that the West should give  full support to Mandela and the ANC . . . .    Q: How has Mandela changed the attitudes of whites?    A: There's something about the charisma of Mandela. Everybody fell in love with  Mandela. (They said:) ""If we have to have a black man, let it be Mandela."" But  what they have to realize is what he's said time and time again -- that he's  not a savior standing alone. If you accept Mandela and respect Mandela, then  you must accept the African National Congress . . . whether you like it or not.  And I think that's a move that still has to be made among whites.    Q: What were your feelings about joining the ANC?    A: It's the first time in my life I've ever belonged to a political party. I  think it's very important that whites who subscribe to the idea of a non-racial  future for South Africa should become signed-up members of the ANC.    Q: Do you think De Klerk is serious about reform?    A: His record isn't very good. He was on the right wing of the Botha  government. But I think he's a very intelligent man. He's proving that every  day. You listen to his speeches and you see how he deals with things. He's  highly intelligent, and he seems to be a worldly man. And God knows we haven't  seen many worldly men among the Afrikaner presidents.    I think he's just seen what I like to call the forces of history . . . . I  think he's realized that this country cannot carry on the way it was. Of  course, they will try desperately to hang onto (giving) whites . . . the final  word in everything, and this is something we have to push against all the time  . . . .    Q: Does the suggestion that there are political divisions among blacks in South  Africa, and even within the ANC, worry you?    A: Why should the world expect there to be absolute unity in the black  population? Where else is there? . . . . It will be the same as it is  everywhere else in the world. There's no unity in the Labor Party in Britain,  no real unity among the Republicans or among the Democrats in the United  States. And obviously if you're going to have a multiparty democracy, you're  going to have that here . . . .    Q: Some artists worry that the ANC is not committed to freedom of expression.  What will happen to artistic freedom under a black-ruled government in South  Africa?    A: No one can guarantee anything. Are we going to have a ministry of culture?  In one way, I want that, because it could encourage young artists. If you have  a ministry of culture, then there's government money to spend on the arts. But  one always fears if you have a ministry of culture then decisions about what is  culture will be made at the ministerial level.    The general feeling, in the ANC and elsewhere, is that we've had enough of  censorship and want to have complete freedom in the arts and freedom to  re-examine anything in our own lives and our own society -- anything at all . .  . .    Q: What do you think the future holds for South Africa?    A: I'm inclined to be optimistic, based on a lifetime of knowledge of the  character of blacks in South Africa . . . . But through all the terrible years  of the struggle and the repression, so many terrible things have happened.    I think it distorts people's character. It certainly brought about a tolerance  of violence, and a feeling that violence is part of our ordinary lives. It's a  danger . . . . There are these constant distortions of people's normal feelings  and reactions . . . . There seems to be no end to the horrors that this policy  can bring about.    On the other hand, there are so many encouraging signs within this awful  matrix. So many people -- black and white -- working together . . . . These  things are happening, but they tend to be overshadowed by the horrors.    Q: For you, how is life today different from a year ago or even 30 years ago?    A: . . . . I really feel -- and this is truly a novelty in my adult life --  that there is something I can openly identify with. I feel so grateful that I'm  still here. That at least I've stayed to see the changes that have come about.    I must keep reminding myself that in terms of the law, almost nothing has  happened. But the fact is the liberation movements have been unbanned, the fact  is that Mandela and the others are now people whose opinions matter a great  deal in national life, at all levels . . . .    It's difficult for Americans to understand how you could live your whole life  without belonging to a political structure, without saying I'm a Democrat or  I'm a Republican. Truly, people like myself have always felt that there was  nothing here we could officially belong to. You were always on the side of the  forbidden.    Q: How have the distortions brought on by apartheid been reflected in your art,  and in the art of South Africa?    A: It has provided a tremendous pressure, obviously. But it's in the nature of  art to resist those pressures. This is true of everybody who practices in the  arts in this country. It doesn't really matter whether they are black or white  or what they are. The distortions are there (but) I think that art exposes  them. If art doesn't expose them, if it just gives in to them, then it loses  its validity as art.

That story launched a writing career that has reached a vast international  reading audience, angered successive white South African governments and earned  the author regular mention as a leading candidate for the Nobel Prize for  Literature.    Through a body of work that includes such novels as ""Burger's Daughter"" and  ""July's People,"" and the short-story collection ""Six Feet of the Country,""  Nadine Gordimer has painted a subtle, yet powerful portrait of the effect of  apartheid on the people who live in South Africa.    Gordimer, 66, still writes regularly on her manual Hermes typewriter, working  in a study of the suburban Johannesburg home she shares with her husband, an  art gallery owner. Her 17th book, a novel called ""My Son's Story,"" is due out  this fall. She spends more time these days encouraging young artists through  the Congress of South African Writers, a mostly black organization of 5,000  writers that she co-founded in 1987.    She is a small, gray-haired woman, only 5 foot 1 and 90 pounds, and a picture  of solemn concentration as she talks about her work and her life, even as the  family German pointer snores peacefully at her side. Playwright Athol Fugard  calls her ""fiercely uncompromising, uncomfortably uncompromising for a lot of  people.""    Her country has changed radically in a matter of months this year and, for the  first time, Gordimer says she has begun to feel more at home in this nation  that has been her lifelong home.    The African National Congress is legal again, after 30 years of waging a  guerrilla war from exile. Nelson Mandela, the man Gordimer considers her  political leader, is free and meets with President Frederik W. de Klerk. And  hardly a week goes by that Gordimer doesn't greet an old friend who has  returned from exile to rejoin the legal political process.    Gordimer joined the ANC the other day with her usual sense of quiet purpose.  She walked into a building near downtown Johannesburg, feeling a special warmth  in the rooms where she and her friends once met secretly. Then she filled out a  single-page form, pulled 12 rand (about $5) from her pocketbook and became a  card-carrying member.    It was the kind of simple scene that she might have used for one of her own  characters: the life-affirming act of a novelist who sees the future of which  she dreamed coming true.    ""I had waited a very long time. It was really quite moving,"" Gordimer said the  next day. ""I had been in and out of that office for years. It was such a nice,  familiar place for this kind of commitment to happen.""    Question: Must a writer in South Africa today be politically active?    Answer: I'm not by nature a political person at all. In the early '60s, I  couldn't even get up on a platform and express an opinion about literature . .  . . I was petrified. And I think if I had lived in another country, I would  have remained like that . . . .    My whole lifetime here, there has been this enormous struggle coming toward the  climax it reached in the past decade or so. And to stand aside from that and  say, ""No, I'm not going to pass an opinion on detentions. I'm not going to take  part in any type of protest against what happens here. I'm not going to speak  about anything."" Whether this is out of reticence or out of fear of the danger,  I don't think you can work here. I don't think you have a right to.    Q: What is the burden of a white person, and particularly a white artist, in  South Africa?    A: If you're a writer, you really need to be left alone. So the burden is that  you really can't be left alone. Whatever you do here, even if you just belong  to a writers' organization, it's all intensely politicized because culture is  intensely politicized . . . . It is a burden. I feel ashamed saying so, because  then you look at other people who really sacrifice all kinds of personal  fulfillment in order to bring about change.    Q: Is art itself a way to bring about change then?    A: That's a delicate matter. All literature is . . . trying to make sense of  life . . . . And if there's any honesty in a writer at all, any self-searching  in your society, it's going to be a (social) critique . . . .    You get involved in your society. You cannot just be a writer. You have to be a  citizen as well. But I think it's terribly important not to become a  propagandist, even for the cause that you believe in most. If you're going to  produce anything worthwhile, you must retain the freedom to write about that  society, warts and all . . . .    This does not mean you have to say you have . . . an ""evenhanded"" approach. I  don't think, in a society like ours, if you're honest and have any moral sense  at all or any decency, you can look at apartheid . . . in an evenhanded way. If  there's anything I am absolutely sure about in my life, it is that racism is  evil . . . . Nobody can defend it. It's pure evil. Therefore, how can you have  an evenhanded view of people who practice racism against those who try to  abolish it. So I think you keep your principles -- more than your principles,  you keep your strong passionate convictions -- about what is wrong. But in your  writing you must be free to show that even those who have passionate  convictions have human faults.    Q: Have writers had any influence on South African society?    A: I think South African fiction writers have had some influence . . . . But  one must be modest about it. In how many countries do writers have any real  influence? You now have this extraordinary happening in that (Vaclav) Havel is  president of a country. But . . . it's very rare. In most countries,  intellectuals have no influence whatever on governments . . . .    I think we have helped in the struggle to the extent that we have been able to  express the unspoken resentments, frustrations, fears, hates, loves of South  Africans, who because of the kind of climate of intimidation here have feared  to say these things openly . . . .    And maybe some whites have been stirred by our writings to examine their own  lives and have doubts about the way they've been acting. But . . . it's a small  influence.    But abroad, I think we have done quite a lot, because . . . in scenes of  violence on a TV screen or in a newspaper report, people's lives are shown at  that point. You don't know what happened before or what goes on afterward.  Whereas in a novel, in stories, you have a deeper view of people's lives. You  see what happened after the riot, what happened after they went home, what  happened to the parents when the child fled the country, went to Swaziland and  they didn't hear of their child for two or three years . . . . All these things  are the result of apartheid and what it does to people here. But you can't see  them in a newscast.    So I think those of us who are read overseas have really had the opportunity to  show the people more of a totality of what apartheid means in human terms.    Q: What's your feeling about the changes occurring inside South Africa today?  What do they mean for blacks in South Africa and why are they, as many say, not  enough?    A: Of course they're not enough. Now, one cannot say that the unbanning of the  liberation movements is insignificant. It was an enormous thing. I heard about  it . . . . I'll never forget the morning. . . . My two comrades in COSAW  (Congress of South African Writers) and I had been out . . . in Soweto.    . . . . We went to the room where Raks Seakgwa (COSAW regional organizer)  lives. He has an enormous TV, which I haven't got. So we sat in his room there  and watched . . . the speech. It was extraordinary because Raks spent five  years on Robben Island (prison). And the other young man, . . . as recently as  1988, spent a year in solitary confinement in detention. And they're such  extraordinary young men because they seemed to have no bitterness; they  accepted it as their part in the struggle for freedom . . . .    So . . . to hear the unbanning of the ANC . . . was for me extraordinary -- and  very humbling. They were absolutely bowled over. They couldn't believe it. So  you can't say that this is nothing.    (But) now all the awful things are happening. You see (President Frederik W.)  de Klerk maneuvering toward a new dispensation here with, from the point of  view of many white people, the most extraordinary concessions to black majority  rule. But I don't think they quite realized what this would bring about,  because it's brought about the resurgence of white Afrikaner fanaticism, racist  fanaticism . . . . (This is) something that dampens one's euphoria . . . .    But to look on the good side, the level at which Nelson Mandela and his group  have been received in the outside world is something that, of course, should  have happened long, long ago. When you think how many years the ANC was totally  ignored by the West, I think it's terribly important that the West should give  full support to Mandela and the ANC . . . .    Q: How has Mandela changed the attitudes of whites?    A: There's something about the charisma of Mandela. Everybody fell in love with  Mandela. (They said:) ""If we have to have a black man, let it be Mandela."" But  what they have to realize is what he's said time and time again -- that he's  not a savior standing alone. If you accept Mandela and respect Mandela, then  you must accept the African National Congress . . . whether you like it or not.  And I think that's a move that still has to be made among whites.    Q: What were your feelings about joining the ANC?    A: It's the first time in my life I've ever belonged to a political party. I  think it's very important that whites who subscribe to the idea of a non-racial  future for South Africa should become signed-up members of the ANC.    Q: Do you think De Klerk is serious about reform?    A: His record isn't very good. He was on the right wing of the Botha  government. But I think he's a very intelligent man. He's proving that every  day. You listen to his speeches and you see how he deals with things. He's  highly intelligent, and he seems to be a worldly man. And God knows we haven't  seen many worldly men among the Afrikaner presidents.    I think he's just seen what I like to call the forces of history . . . . I  think he's realized that this country cannot carry on the way it was. Of  course, they will try desperately to hang onto (giving) whites . . . the final  word in everything, and this is something we have to push against all the time  . . . .    Q: Does the suggestion that there are political divisions among blacks in South  Africa, and even within the ANC, worry you?    A: Why should the world expect there to be absolute unity in the black  population? Where else is there? . . . . It will be the same as it is  everywhere else in the world. There's no unity in the Labor Party in Britain,  no real unity among the Republicans or among the Democrats in the United  States. And obviously if you're going to have a multiparty democracy, you're  going to have that here . . . .    Q: Some artists worry that the ANC is not committed to freedom of expression.  What will happen to artistic freedom under a black-ruled government in South  Africa?    A: No one can guarantee anything. Are we going to have a ministry of culture?  In one way, I want that, because it could encourage young artists. If you have  a ministry of culture, then there's government money to spend on the arts. But  one always fears if you have a ministry of culture then decisions about what is  culture will be made at the ministerial level.    The general feeling, in the ANC and elsewhere, is that we've had enough of  censorship and want to have complete freedom in the arts and freedom to  re-examine anything in our own lives and our own society -- anything at all . .  . .    Q: What do you think the future holds for South Africa?    A: I'm inclined to be optimistic, based on a lifetime of knowledge of the  character of blacks in South Africa . . . . But through all the terrible years  of the struggle and the repression, so many terrible things have happened.    I think it distorts people's character. It certainly brought about a tolerance  of violence, and a feeling that violence is part of our ordinary lives. It's a  danger . . . . There are these constant distortions of people's normal feelings  and reactions . . . . There seems to be no end to the horrors that this policy  can bring about.    On the other hand, there are so many encouraging signs within this awful  matrix. So many people -- black and white -- working together . . . . These  things are happening, but they tend to be overshadowed by the horrors.    Q: For you, how is life today different from a year ago or even 30 years ago?    A: . . . . I really feel -- and this is truly a novelty in my adult life --  that there is something I can openly identify with. I feel so grateful that I'm  still here. That at least I've stayed to see the changes that have come about.    I must keep reminding myself that in terms of the law, almost nothing has  happened. But the fact is the liberation movements have been unbanned, the fact  is that Mandela and the others are now people whose opinions matter a great  deal in national life, at all levels . . . .    It's difficult for Americans to understand how you could live your whole life  without belonging to a political structure, without saying I'm a Democrat or  I'm a Republican. Truly, people like myself have always felt that there was  nothing here we could officially belong to. You were always on the side of the  forbidden.    Q: How have the distortions brought on by apartheid been reflected in your art,  and in the art of South Africa?    A: It has provided a tremendous pressure, obviously. But it's in the nature of  art to resist those pressures. This is true of everybody who practices in the  arts in this country. It doesn't really matter whether they are black or white  or what they are. The distortions are there (but) I think that art exposes  them. If art doesn't expose them, if it just gives in to them, then it loses  its validity as art.

0,FT934-15033 ,"FT934-15033 _AN-DJNDKAGZFT 931013   FT  13 OCT 93 / TV politicians vie with sumo and starlets: The sprouting of new parties has meant a bonanza for Japan's producers      By EMIKO TERAZONO   IN between reports of a cocaine smuggling scandal and the latest gossip on a starlet's divorce, Japanese television's Morning Eye now covers policy speeches by Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the country's new prime minister. 'You can't leave out politics these days,' says Mr Katsuyuki Ishimori of Tokyo Broadcasting System, the network that airs the programme. Political coverage in Japan has traditionally been dominated by the daily newspapers, which kept important disclosures and information to themselves, to maintain cozy relationships with politicians. Instead, TV stories focused on squabbles between factions within the LDP. But the downfall of the LDP and the sprouting of new parties have created an extravaganza for TV producers and their viewers. 'Politics is easier to understand these days. In a way, it has become a show,' says Asahi Television, one of the nationwide networks. It is not just that television has discovered politicians, the politicians have discovered television. Members of the coalition government are putting it to full use in their efforts to present a different image from their predecessors in the Liberal Democratic Party, which held power for 38 years. In an unprecedented move, Mr Hosokawa gave his press conference with Mr John Major, UK prime minister, in the lush green garden of his residence in central Tokyo last month. Instead of sitting in front of a desk, the two premiers stood in front of podiums, while Mr Hosokawa pointed to reporters with his pen in the 'Bill Clinton' way. Television also played a leading part in politicking, following dissolution of the parliament in July. Camera crews eagerly followed the members of the new groups splintering from the LDP. Mr Susmu Yanase, of the New Harbinger Party, was nicknamed 'Crybaby Yanase' after he was filmed leaving the LDP headquarters in tears. Politicians of all camps aired their views and sometimes argued with each other, in public, a stark change from traditional political negotiations held behind the scenes in expensive Japanese tatami-mat restaurants or smoke-filled hotel rooms. But the excessive campaign coverage ahead of the lower-house elections in July has been blamed for low voter turnout on election day. 'People closely watching politics on television already felt they had participated,' one media analyst says. At the same time, the programmes decided the fate of some of the candidates. Ms Makiko Tanaka, the daughter of Mr Kakuei Tanaka, a former prime minister who fell from grace due to his involvement in a scandal in the 1970s, has been a fierce critic of the media. However, her recent election as an MP followed a campaign which was covered extensively on television, and she has since become an advocate of TV coverage of politics. Leading politicians have also begun to use television to float policies. Reporters now sit in front of their TV screens awaiting important comments, and it is quite common for provocative statements on political talk-shows to make the headlines in the daily newspapers. One of the more controversial television appearances was by Mr Masayoshi Takemura, chief cabinet secretary, who recently expressed support for electoral reform plans during a talk show, which were opposed by the two leading coalition parties. His comments prompted strong criticism from within the coalition, forcing Mr Takemura to apologise to party leaders. The television networks are owned by leading national newspapers with a wide range of political views, from the vaguely leftist Asahi to the more conservative Yomiuri. But to appeal to a wide range of viewers, political bias, where it has appeared, has been limited to labelling the new reformist parties 'good' and the old LDP 'bad'. This, say some critics, is one of the dangers of political coverage by television. Mr Akira Aoki, professor of communications at the Tokyo University of Information Sciences, says that while television has made politics more digestible for the ordinary viewer, it has also tended to over-simplify issues. 'Things aren't that simple, but television isn't able to give in-depth explanation to its viewers.' he contends. Once the political scene becomes stable (and dull), it could lose its place in morning variety shows. However, with frictions within the coalition government starting to appear, and some younger members of the LDP threatening to quit the main party, politicians may go on holding their place in television along with the sumo wrestlers and the film stars.

0,FT924-8922 ,"FT924-8922 _AN-CKIBWAAUFT 921109   FT  09 NOV 92 / Mitterrand TV talk on Aids row      By WILLIAM DAWKINS      PARIS   FRENCH President Francois Mitterrand will tonight try to take the initiative from the government's critics by staging a television interview on the recent scandal over the distribution of Aids-tainted blood to haemophiliacs. This will be his first set-piece television appearance since a marathon three-hour debate two months ago, shortly before the Maastricht referendum, and his first since undergoing surgery for cancer of the prostate. It will therefore give valuable clues to the mental and physical fitness of the 76-year-old president, said by government ministers to be on combative form. Since he won a narrow victory in the referendum, Mr Mitterrand's popularity ratings have improved. However, his government is dogged by minor internal splits, continuing high unemployment and a sluggish economy and faces defeat in next March's legislative elections. Mr Mitterrand wants to use today's interview to hit back at criticisms of Socialist ministers over the Aids scandal, relating to a period in 1985 when the national blood transfusion service allowed infected blood to be given to more than 1,200 haemophiliacs. The president is also likely to face questions on other big issues of the day, such as the looming trade war with the US and the British decision to delay ratifying the Maastricht treaty until after Danish ratification. Mr Mitterrand is also likely to be questioned on possible constitutional reforms, including giving more influence to France's relatively powerless parliament and shortening the president's renewable seven-year mandate. He announced plans for such reforms on television a year ago, since when the issue has been pushed aside by the debate on European monetary and political union.

0,FT921-10705 ,"FT921-10705 _AN-CBEBPABEFT 920205   FT  05 FEB 92 / Management: Sun sets on share scandal - Stefan Wagstyl reports on Nomura's efforts to regain its reputation / Japanese securities      By STEFAN WAGSTYL   In New York or London, the combination of the worst stock market scandal in memory and a long bear market might drive even a strong securities company into bankruptcy. But in Tokyo, neither last year's scandals involving links with gangsters and secret compensation payments to clients, nor a 90 per cent decline in stock exchange turnover, is likely to remove Nomura Securities from its top position in the securities industry. The mood at the company's headquarters has changed since last summer when Nomura staff witnessed in horror the resignations of Yoshihisa Tabuchi and Setsuya Tabuchi - the two men who had headed the group for 12 years. They quit over links with a gangster organisation, over compensation payments made to favoured clients and allegations of stock manipulation. Today there is a quiet determination to make sure the company pulls through the bear market and recovers its reputation. As Atsushi Saito, an executive managing director, says: 'We have no intention of making money at the expense of other brokers but Nomura will be the least damaged by the bear market'. The company is going through a management reform designed to increase efficiency, improve contact with customers and erase the memory of the scandal. Executives want to rid the company of the reputation for arrogance which dogged it through the 1980s. Nomura used to move like a bulldozer in the market, with headquarters instructing salesmen across Japan which stock to promote and the salesmen pushing the shares on to their hapless clients. Saito and his colleagues want the new Nomura to be more responsive to customers' needs. There is little doubting the commitment to reform at the top. But it is a moot point how fast the company can remould the attitudes of staff in its domestic branch network. As one foreign broker in Tokyo says: 'What internationally-minded people like Saito think is one thing. What the branch managers think is another'. The root of the company's self-confidence is its formidable financial power. In the year to the end of March 1991, it made Y142bn (Pounds 639.63m) net from interest and dividends on its own cash and securities holdings - equivalent to half the pre-tax profit and enough to cover the wages bill for 10 months. In the six months to September, the period when last year's scandal was at its height, Nomura made a pre-tax profit of Y39.7bn - down 64 per cent compared with the same period in 1990 but still almost twice as much as second-ranked Daiwa Securities. Certainly Nomura is hurt by the fall in business on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, where turnover last month was less than one tenth of the average in 1988. Like other brokers, Nomura is cutting costs, including its lavish entertainment budget. More significantly, Nomura is reducing the number of new graduates it hires from 1,525 in 1991 to 1,000 this year and probably fewer still in 1993. But cutting the intake is different from dismissing existing staff - a last resort for any large Japanese company. As a result, Nomura and other big brokers are able to rely on the loyalty of the workforce, even in times of crisis. Under the regime of lifetime employment, from other groups. So the managers of a troubled group have no choice but to redouble their efforts to avoid disaster. Moreover, tight regulation has saved Japanese brokers from the worst effects of the bear market. The finance ministry frowns on brokers trading on their own accounts, which has partly shielded them from big investment losses. The finance ministry is as much a guardian of financial companies as their regulator. So even though officials handed out penalties to Nomura for its involvement in the scandals, there was no possibility that the punishments would break the company. Nevertheless, the scandal has forced Nomura to acknowledge a need for reform. Top of the list is winning back the trust of private investors who account for some 50 per cent of brokerage income. The most important departure is training staff to tailor products to clients' needs. The risks of securities investments will be clearly explained to clients: 'health warnings' have already been printed on promotional pamphlets. This is a tacit acknowledgement that the company's bull market tactics of foisting high-risk instruments, such as equity warrants, onto private investors have back-fired. At the same time, branches are being given more freedom to decide which products to sell. Yasuyuki Idotsuji, the manager of the Ginza branch in central Tokyo, says: 'In the past, head office told us which products to sell. Now we decide.' Idotsuji says company training sessions once consisted only of lessons in 'how to sell more'. Now sales staff are being taught how to collate and interpret information. Nomura has also reformed its staff assessment system to put success in reaching sales targets and more on their knowledge of products and ability to train staff. Greater freedom for branches is being coupled to a transformation of the Nomura's Research Institute. According to Saito, NRI researchers have in the past produced work which is overly academic - long analyses of issues with little relevance to picking stocks. Nomura is anxious to show that it is already handling investment information more openly than before. For example, the company's forecasts, once famous for their permanent optimism, are this year notably pessimistic. Officials are free to voice the most damning opinions. Cynics say these reforms are superficial: it suits Nomura to trumpet their importance to create an impression of change. But, say critics, the moment share prices recover and the customers return, the temptation to return to the old ways will be strong. The company's transformation is certainly incomplete. Hideo Sakamaki, the new president, was the close lieutenant of the disgraced Yoshihisa Tabuchi. Also, even though both Tabuchis have lost their board seats, they still have honorary posts and their own offices. Moreover, Nomura, along with other Japanese brokers, has announced reforms in the past which achieved less than had been promised. For example, in 1988, the group said it was building Chinese walls - internal barriers - to divide its underwriting business from broking, in order to prevent brokers using inside information gained from the underwriters. But last year's scandal showed close co-operation between the two areas. Similarly, finance ministry officials have said that the brokers are dragging their feet over the elimination of discretionary accounts which they manage on clients' behalf. Such accounts are open to abuse by brokers who might want to generate commission rather than maximise a client's returns. Nevertheless, it would be wrong to minimise the extent of change at Nomura, not least because reform is in the company's own interest. The old system of generating commission by promoting a small selection of stocks very intensely worked in a bull market. In a bear market, it is in the broker's own interest to market other products more aggressively, even if these generate less commission. Moreover, the steady advance of financial deregulation in Tokyo will gradually give retail investors, as well as institutions, more choice. The finance ministry is planning to introduce next year legal reforms which will greatly increase the range of products which can be sold as securities. At the same time, the ministry is considering the reduction of stock exchange commission charges and their possible elimination. Even if the securities industry succeeded in postponing cuts for a while, it accepts that equity broking will never be as lucrative as it was in the 1980s. Diversification is essential. Executives at all the larger brokerages acknowledge the force of these arguments. But Nomura alone has the resources to meet the challenge head on.

In his contacts with The Hague 'Arafat has always shown he  is  not just interested in trade and aid relations with the  Netherlands. The PLO leader also sees a political role for the  Netherlands as a traditional ally to Israel.    He realizes that, thanks to the emotional Netherlands links  with Israel, Lubbers can make his influence count both in  Jerusalem and in the European Union. On Wednesday in Jerusalem  Rabin's spokesman said that an exceptionally good understanding  had arisen between Lubbers and Rabin since the Israeli prime  minister's visit to the Netherlands last June.

0,FT924-271 ,"FT924-271 _AN-CL2BCACEFT 921229   FT  29 DEC 92 / Japanese ministry penalises broker      By ROBERT THOMSON      TOKYO   JAPAN'S Ministry of Finance yesterday disciplined Cosmo Securities, a second-tier stockbroker, by ordering it to suspend certain corporate business and bond trading operations. The penalty follows the first completed investigation by the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission, which was established to clean up the industry following the scandals that hit the Tokyo stock market last year. Cosmo is accused of irregularities in dealing with corporate clients. Mr Yasuo Bunya, Cosmo's chairman, has indicated his intention to resign next month. While Cosmo is the first to be punished, most other Japanese brokers have admitted compensating favoured corporate clients for investment losses, and it remains to be seen whether they will also be pursued by the new commission. Cosmo was also not the only company to have concealed clients' losses through the technique known as 'tobashi' - transferring lossmaking stocks from client account to client account in an attempt to avoid booking the loss. The ministry ordered Cosmo to suspend corporate business in Tokyo from January 11 to January 18. It will be forbidden from dealing in convertible bonds on its own account for four weeks from January 11. Three former Cosmo executives are alleged to have compensated select clients for losses by buying their convertible bonds at higher than market prices. The commission said the company continued the compensation even though the ministry said the practice was unlawful. The Finance Ministry blames the compensation scandal for undermining individual investors' confidence in the stock market. Meanwhile, the 'tobashi' dealings have led to court cases against Japanese brokers from companies which say they suffered unfairly by being lumbered with the losing stocks.

AVF spokesman Stephan Maninger said  on Thursday: ""Not only have we been saying as much, but the  National Party [NP] government also has had access to security  infrastructure through which it must have been aware of the fact  that the ANC has never stopped conducting terror attacks which  include political killings.""    Mr Maninger was reacting to newspaper and radio reports  quoting an East Rand Self Defence Unit [SDU] member, codenamed  Tembo, as saying killing particular people did not worry him.    Tembo reportedly said: ""I don't think about it because that  is the situation, that when we kill particular people, for me it  is like I have killed a chicken because I see no reason for him  to live if he does not understand what the will of the people  is, and what we are fighting for.""    The AVF found it strange that the NP had reacted to the  report by accusing the ANC of a ""massive disinformation campaign  to blame others for the violence"", said Mr Maninger. ""Two days  ago State President F W de Klerk and ANC leader Nelson Mandela  were jointly blaming so-called elements on the right for the  township violence. ""Consequently we see (NP information  director) Marthinus van Schalkwyk's attack on the ANC as  shadow-boxing for political gain.

He spoke to SOWETAN last  Friday [4 February], shortly before startling allegations of a  lack of discipline, desertions and drunkenness within the NPKF's  3,500-strong force outside Bloemfontein hit the headlines. The  force was originally scheduled to complete its training at the  end of March for deployment in troubled townships in the last  four weeks of the election campaign. The force was aimed at  ensuring non-partisan policing and was envisaged to grow to  10,000 men and women.    Ramushwana was particularly critical of the standard of  training of Umkhonto weSizwe [Spear of the Nation; ANC military  wing--MK] soldiers in the NPKF. This was also against the  background of claims that four MK cadres were dismissed from the  De Brug base where the NPKF began training two weeks ago. ""I am  not hopeful that the national peacekeeping force will be ready  in the remaining six weeks it has to prepare for elections,""  Ramushwana said.    He was appointed NPKF commanding officer by the Transitional  Executive Council last month. He said he found no basis for  allegations that MK soldiers had shouted racist slogans. With  regard to problems at NPKF headquarters, ANC spokesman Mr Carl  Niehaus said yesterday's news reports were ""an overstatement and  were calculated to put MK in a bad light"". He rejected  Ramushwana's claim that MK training was below standard, saying  any soldier would have difficulty adjusting to new forms of  training. ANC president Mr Nelson Mandela told journalists in  Bloemfontein he was confident Ramushwana would be able to sort  out the problems.     "

President Li was greeted by many high-ranking officials,  including Vice President Li Yuan-zu, at Sungshan Airport in  downtown Taipei.    Li did not make any formal statements on his trip at the  airport. He may meet the press on May 26 to explain the  significance of his four-nation state visit, government sources  said.    Accompanied by a large entourage, Li began his global tour  aboard a chartered China Airlines plane, which took him to  Nicaragua, Costa Rica, South Africa and Swaziland.    Li made a stopover at Singapore's Changi International  Airport on his return flight from South Africa. Many senior  Singaporean officials, including Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong,  greeted Li at the airport, television news reports said.    Li's four-nation visit aimed to strengthen the Republic of  China [ROC]'s diplomatic ties with its allies. Li signed joint  communiques with heads of state of Nicaragua, Costa Rica and  Swaziland pledging to further strengthen cooperation in various  fields. Li also met with the new South African president,  Nelson Mandela, during his stay in Pretoria. Li and Mandela  reaffirmed their determination to further boost bilateral ties.    This was Li's first official overseas trip since he assumed  the presidency in 1988. Li made an unofficial visit to  Singapore in 1989 and to the Philippines, Indonesia and Thailand  early this year as part of his effort to promote Taiwan's  substantive relations with other countries and to increase  Taiwan's presence in the world arena. Taiwan does not maintain  diplomatic ties with the four Southeast Asian nations.     "

IT DOES MEAN PROTECTION AGAINST THE ABUSE OF POWER BY THE MAJORITY.      By FREDERIK W. de KLERK, Frederik W. de Klerk is the president of South Africa.  His article is adapted from an interview in the upcoming issue of World Link, a  publication of the Geneva-based Davos World Economic Forum.      PRETORIA      Regardless of what other people say, I believe that sanctions per se are not  the main problem in South Africa. Our prime concern is the domestic situation  -- that is, the process of negotiation with all South Africans for a better  future and the need for improvement of the quality of life for all.    Insofar as sanctions against South Africa exist, we are living with them. What  they have done, however, is retard our ability to fulfill our commitment to  redress social and other backlogs in an imaginative way and on a sufficiently  large scale. Should the international community re-evaluate its position on  sanctions, it would allow us to harness our country's resources and face our  challenges effectively, both inside South Africa and in the whole subcontinent  -- challenges that can best be met by a vibrant South African economy.    We disagree with the African National Congress' anachronistic emphasis on  nationalization of industry, which it sees as the guarantee of a redistribution  of wealth. We believe that a free-enterprise economy is the key to economic  progress in the future. It is a proven system capable of generating new wealth  and new opportunities, as is evidenced in the progress of the industrialized  nations that adhere to it.    In South Africa, unfortunately, this system is seen by many as synonymous with  apartheid. In their rejection of apartheid, many would then equally, and  mistakenly, equate a centrally controlled economy with economic progress. These  are links that must be broken.    My greatest hope is to bring about a just and fair South Africa by peaceful  means. The greatest trap would be that radicalism and escalating conflict get  out of hand. While firmly and fairly maintaining law and order, we must  therefore strive for consensus, lifting our gaze above the many stumbling  blocks presented by self-interest, exaggerated expectations and fear.    In this endeavor, I believe I can work with Nelson Mandela. I believe I can  work with him and other leaders in negotiating a new constitution for our  country on the basis of give and take. I have seen Mandela keep his word after  discussions with me. I perceive him to be a man who prefers peace to violence.  He is a friendly and dignified man.    There is no doubt in my mind that the overwhelming majority of South Africans  are in favor of the kind of peaceful change I would like to bring about with  the help of Mandela and other leaders with a proven support base. The mere fact  that I could sit down with an ANC delegation earlier this year, I think,  testifies to the will of the South Africans to give peace a chance.    I believe that, on the black side of politics, there is a growing acceptance --  even among those who used violence as a method of policy -- of the government's  integrity in negotiating a common future. The time of violent confrontation is  past. All of us share some common ground in realizing that peace is the only  option.    Once the negotiation process has gained momentum -- and the government is eager  for this process to start as soon as possible -- the search for consensus will  replace polarization.    We now want to work out a just and equitable system for all, but at the same  time make sure that those who have enjoyed full freedoms do not forfeit them.  That is why the National Party repeatedly emphasizes, in addition to universal  franchise, the principle of nondomination and the protection of the rights and  interests of minorities.    Franchise on a common voters' roll in an otherwise undifferentiated and  unqualified system of political representation must lead inevitably to majority  domination of minorities. History has ample examples of the tension,  frustration and conflict that unavoidably go together with the domination of  closely knit minority groups.    A constitutional system based on the ""winner-take-all"" approach is therefore  not the answer to South Africa's complexities. It does not provide for adequate  protection of minorities, nor for the cultural, religious and language  differences among South Africans. However, universal adult franchise within a  system into which constitutional mechanisms of protection are built is indeed  an achievable possibility.    One would be mistaken to draw from this a plea against the majority of the  country's population getting their due. The whole argument now centers around  unqualified majority rule without the balance of protection for minorities.  Protection of minorities, I hasten to add, does not mean protection of  privilege nor continuation of domination by a minority. It does, however, mean  protection against the abuse of power by the majority.    To repeat, I am in favor of universal adult franchise within a constitutional  dispensation based on the principle of nondomination and into which most of  these mechanisms are built: the decentralization of power, the devolution of  authority to lower levels, constitutional checks and balances, decision-making  by consensus and an independent judiciary.

When the Justice Department announced Operation Ill Wind last June, it was as  if a hurricane had suddenly struck the entire defense-procurement system.    The revelations concerning potential criminal behavior on the part of some  well-connected defense consultants brought the usually behind-the-scenes world  of consulting out into the open. Just as the eye of a hurricane provides a  brief respite, the secrecy of the grand-jury process has thrown a calmness over  the events of the scandal over procurement. It is appropriate then, in this  time of relative calm, to take a systematic look at the role that consultants  play in our government.    Since 1978, when President Jimmy Carter asked for a short list of all  consultants who were working for the federal government, we have been aware of  an abysmal lack of information on the government's use of such people. We do  not know the answers to such basic questions as how many consultants work for  the government, how much we pay them (estimates have ranged from $243 million a  year to $26 billion a year), what work they are doing, or whether anyone has  checked to see if federal workers could have done the job.    Yet, increasingly, the basic work of government has been delegated to a work  force that is nowhere to be found on the official organization charts -- a  shadow government.    It is not my contention that this shadow government is totally corrupt. It is  my contention that Congress, the press and the public should have easy access  to the ""real organizational charts"" of our federal agencies. Only when we have  information on the numbers of consultants and the actual work that they are  performing can we then have a true picture of our government.    We found in the past that the Department of Energy employed a contractor to  help plan our nation's response to future oil shortages. This same contractor  also worked for the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. A federal  worker would not be allowed to maintain this potential conflict of interest.  But in the shadow of government the agencies often don't know what  private-sector (or in this case what international) interests the consultants  or contractors have.    At the Department of Defense, we recently found that a consulting organization  had largely written the department's directive that established the Pentagon's  policy on consultants.    In 1981 the Department of Defense testified that it had 31,000 contractors  performing consulting services, studies, management and professional services.  The government did not know in 1981, and the government still does not fully  know in 1989, what potential conflicts of interests exist between the work that  these individuals do for the government and the work that they do for the  private sector.    In the defense-procurement scandal we have seen that private contractors  themselves have the resources and the incentive to hire their own private  consultants. The actual work performed by these private-sector consultants and  their relationship to the government is shrouded in the same shadow as the  government's own consultants and contractors.    It is all too difficult to find the most basic data on the government's private  work force. But at least when a consultant is hired by the government some  record should exist. This new level in the private bureaucracy, where  consultants hire consultants, defies even the most basic opportunity for  scrutiny. Though tax dollars might (it is hard to say with certainty) be paying  these consultants to consultants, neither Congress nor the public can find out  what these people are actually doing.    We are becoming a nation of insiders and outsiders, not public officials and  citizens. On the one hand, the public is unaware of the decisions and actions  made by this unelected bureaucracy. On the other hand, those who happen to be  plugged into this shadow government have privileged access to government  information. When unscrupulous individuals trade on this government information  and are caught, we have a scandal. I deplore this alleged example of  profiteering off one's privileged access to information. Until we have total  disclosure, however, we simply don't know the extent of the procurement  problems.    We need our own glasnost in this area. Unless we have comprehensive disclosure  of the private-sector connections of persons hired as government consultants or  contractors, then neither Congress, the citizens nor indeed the majority of the  federal work force can have complete trust that we are receiving unbiased and  untainted advice. Furthermore, as far as defense contracting is concerned, only  through disclosure will we know if major procurement decisions (that is, weapon  systems) are being made based on reasons of national security and not based on  who had the best inside information. While the disclosure of who is doing what  for the federal government and who his private-sector clients are will not  solve all the defense-procurement problems, this openness will go a long way  toward restoring confidence in our system.    I am somewhat encouraged by the Pentagon's recent announcement that it no  longer opposes the registration of consultants. With the Defense Department's  support, perhaps the congressionally mandated requirement for the  Administration to formulate a consultant registration proposal will result in  some meaningful procurement reform. Unfortunately, the legislation gives the  incoming Bush Administration the option of deciding whether or not to actually  use the registration proposal.    Yet when the grand-jury indictments start the Operation Ill Wind hurricane  blowing again, I hope that the new Administration will seize the concept of  consultant registration as a way of restoring taxpayer confidence in a troubled  system.

Only when we have  information on the numbers of consultants and the actual work that they are  performing can we then have a true picture of our government.    We found in the past that the Department of Energy employed a contractor to  help plan our nation's response to future oil shortages. This same contractor  also worked for the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. A federal  worker would not be allowed to maintain this potential conflict of interest.  But in the shadow of government the agencies often don't know what  private-sector (or in this case what international) interests the consultants  or contractors have.    At the Department of Defense, we recently found that a consulting organization  had largely written the department's directive that established the Pentagon's  policy on consultants.    In 1981 the Department of Defense testified that it had 31,000 contractors  performing consulting services, studies, management and professional services.  The government did not know in 1981, and the government still does not fully  know in 1989, what potential conflicts of interests exist between the work that  these individuals do for the government and the work that they do for the  private sector.    In the defense-procurement scandal we have seen that private contractors  themselves have the resources and the incentive to hire their own private  consultants. The actual work performed by these private-sector consultants and  their relationship to the government is shrouded in the same shadow as the  government's own consultants and contractors.    It is all too difficult to find the most basic data on the government's private  work force. But at least when a consultant is hired by the government some  record should exist. This new level in the private bureaucracy, where  consultants hire consultants, defies even the most basic opportunity for  scrutiny. Though tax dollars might (it is hard to say with certainty) be paying  these consultants to consultants, neither Congress nor the public can find out  what these people are actually doing.    We are becoming a nation of insiders and outsiders, not public officials and  citizens. On the one hand, the public is unaware of the decisions and actions  made by this unelected bureaucracy. On the other hand, those who happen to be  plugged into this shadow government have privileged access to government  information. When unscrupulous individuals trade on this government information  and are caught, we have a scandal. I deplore this alleged example of  profiteering off one's privileged access to information. Until we have total  disclosure, however, we simply don't know the extent of the procurement  problems.    We need our own glasnost in this area. Unless we have comprehensive disclosure  of the private-sector connections of persons hired as government consultants or  contractors, then neither Congress, the citizens nor indeed the majority of the  federal work force can have complete trust that we are receiving unbiased and  untainted advice. Furthermore, as far as defense contracting is concerned, only  through disclosure will we know if major procurement decisions (that is, weapon  systems) are being made based on reasons of national security and not based on  who had the best inside information. While the disclosure of who is doing what  for the federal government and who his private-sector clients are will not  solve all the defense-procurement problems, this openness will go a long way  toward restoring confidence in our system.    I am somewhat encouraged by the Pentagon's recent announcement that it no  longer opposes the registration of consultants. With the Defense Department's  support, perhaps the congressionally mandated requirement for the  Administration to formulate a consultant registration proposal will result in  some meaningful procurement reform. Unfortunately, the legislation gives the  incoming Bush Administration the option of deciding whether or not to actually  use the registration proposal.    Yet when the grand-jury indictments start the Operation Ill Wind hurricane  blowing again, I hope that the new Administration will seize the concept of  consultant registration as a way of restoring taxpayer confidence in a troubled  system.

Alcatel-Alsthom saw its overall sales fall by 3.4 per cent to FFr156.07bn (Dollars 26.2bn) in 1993 from FFr161.68bn in 1992. Mr Pierre Suard, Alcatel's chairman, had previously warned investors that sales were likely to decline in 1993 and forecast a further reduction in 1994 due to the contraction in the company's European telecommunications activities. Mr Suard has also forecast static profits of around FFr7bn for the group in 1993 followed by a fall in profits during the current year reflecting the increase in its investments. Bouygues, the world's largest construction company, was also hit by a slowdown in its European business. It reported a 4.8 per cent decline in sales to FFr59.7bn for 1993 against FFr62.72bn in the previous year. The group has previously predicted a fall in net profits for 1993 to around FFr450m from FFr685m in 1992, mainly due to the downturn in the property market. Ciments Francais, the building materials company, was another casualty of the construction industry's difficulties. The company, which was recently involved in a scandal over off-balance sheet losses, saw sales fall by 9.7 per cent to FFr13.46bn in 1993 from FFr14.77bn in 1992. The gloomy mood was reinforced by the announcement of a 3.5 per cent decline in sales for Bollore Technologies, the diversified industrial concern that has been hit by the difficulties of SDV, its shipping division. Bollore, which fell into the red in 1992, has already warned of further losses for last year when sales slipped by 3.5 per cent to FFr24.81bn from FFr25.72bn in 1992.   Companies:-  Bouygues.

0,FT921-4921 ,"FT921-4921 _AN-CCFAOAD6FT 920306   FT  06 MAR 92 / Miyazawa sidelined by scandals: The waning popularity of Japan's prime minister      By STEFAN WAGSTYL   THE POPULARITY of Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, has sunk so low that officials running an important by-election campaign for his ruling Liberal Democratic party (LDP) have asked him to stay away. The prime minister, who came to office just five months ago with an ambitious domestic and international agenda, has been reduced to near-impotence by political scandal and the agonisingly long argument over whether Japan's rice market should be opened up. Mr Miyazawa had hoped to make his mark as a leader who dealt successfully with the challenge of enhancing Japan's contribution to world affairs. Instead, he is most likely to be remembered for his inability to defuse three separate scandals: the aftermath of the Recruit stocks-for-favours affair, the Kyowa bribery case, and the unfolding drama of Sagawa Kyubin, a transport company with links to gangsters. The scandals, according to opinion polls, are uppermost in the minds of the electorate in Miyagi, a farming district in northern Japan, who vote on Sunday in a by-election for the lower house of the Diet (parliament). Rural constituents are also angry with the LDP for hinting that Japan might open its rice market to imports. Mr Nobuo Onodera, the LDP candidate, and his campaign managers have asked Mr Miyazawa and Mr Michio Watanabe, the foreign minister, to stay away from the hustings. 'The bottom line is that they are just not wanted here. We told them not to come,' said Mr Takayoshi Kono, a campaign manager. The seat was left vacant by the death of the incumbent, an Social Democrat. The opposition won the seat only in 1989, at the height of the Recruit affair; Miyagi had been an LDP stronghold, and the party had hoped to win it back. Given the passions aroused in rural Japan by the rice issue, the campaign would never have been easy for the LDP. But Mr Onodera, a popular local politician and a former head of the prefectural assembly, hoped to succeed by proclaiming his opposition to liberalising the market. However, the scandals seem to have cut much of the ground from under his feet. According to opinion polls, even LDP supporters plan to register their anger by voting for a candidate sponsored by Rengo, the Japanese trade union organisation. Even though many Japanese have got bored with the endless flow of allegations of political corruption, recent events seem to have inflamed their anger once more. Interest was focused this week on a case dating back to 1982. The Tokyo High Court, a court of appeal, acquitted Mr Fumio Yokote, a former Diet member, of taking bribes from the National Federation of Thread-Plying Industry Co-operatives Associations, a textiles grouping. He had been convicted of taking Y2m (Pounds 8,780) from the association in 1982 in return for using his influence with government officials to secure subsidies for the industry. The high court overturned the conviction on the grounds that the only evidence against Mr Yokote was the testimony of two alleged bribers. The judge said their evidence was suspect because they had themselves been charged with bribery in connection with other incidents and therefore may have altered their evidence in the hope of securing lighter sentences. The judgment and reasoning has provoked criticism. Daily Gendai, the tabloid newspaper, said in a report yesterday that 'the judgment makes clear that without a reform in the law, political reform is impossible'. An Asahi newspaper editorial urged the public prosecutor's office not to be discouraged by the verdict from pursuing future scandals with the greatest vigour. The scandal which has most directly hurt Mr Miyazawa is the affair in which Recruit, a publishing company, tried to curry favour by handing out cut-price stock. Mr Miyazawa was finance minister when the scandal broke in 1988 and resigned for his (minor) involvement. He admitted his secretary had accepted cut-price shares. But now he is prime minister, opposition parties want to re-examine his role in the affair by questioning one of his aides in the Diet. Mr Miyazawa has also been tarnished by the affair involving Kyowa, a steel frame maker and property developer, which allegedly bribed Mr Fumio Abe, a former minister and close associate of the prime minister. Mr Abe has been charged with accepting about Y90m in bribes in return for disclosing planning information. In investigating links between Sagawa Kyubin and Inagawakai, a leading criminal organisation, the public prosecutor's office has found evidence of large flows of money to politicians. However, it has yet to find any hard evidence of wrongdoing on the politicians' part. If the LDP loses in Miyagi, its hold on the Diet's lower house will remain unaffected. But a loss will do nothing to improve its prospects in the July elections to the upper house, where the LDP lost its majority in 1989. Under Diet rules, the party with a lower house majority can force many kinds of legislation through the upper house. But bulldozer tactics run counter to Japanese custom and practice. Rather, the ruling party is expected to take account of public opinion as expressed in elections, including by-elections, and adjust its policies accordingly. Since 1989, this has produced a virtual impasse on important legislation in the Diet, particularly in the field of political reform. The LDP has discussed numerous plans, but Diet members have, not surprisingly, found it impossible to agree on measures which would hurt their finances.  The Financial Times   London Page 4  "

0,FT922-1523 ,"FT922-1523 _AN-CFVA1ADFFT 920622   FT  22 JUN 92 / Negotiation likely to be Mandela's only choice: The political aftermath of a week of confrontation      By PHILIP GAWITH   WE WANT arms now, declared the slogan on the placard greeting Mr Nelson Mandela, president of the African National Congress, as he arrived to address a township rally yesterday at the end of a week of confrontation and violence that has stunned South Africa. At a dusty football ground at Evaton, 25 miles south of Johannesburg, the ANC leader was left in no doubt about the anger of the 15,000-strong, predominantly youthful, crowd. 'Mandela', declared another poster, 'give us permission to kill our enemies'. And as the ANC president asked what the party should do, a forest of arms went up, with fists clenched and index finger curled, simulating the trigger action of a gun. It would have been surprising if Mr Mandela had responded to the anger with anything other than the announcement that he was suspending bilateral talks with the government designed to end last May's impasse in constitutional negotiations. It was all but inevitable that the stalemate at the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (Codesa), the multi-party negotiating forum, should be followed by confrontation in the townships. More than two years after Mr Mandela's release the ANC and its allies seemed as far away as ever from their main objective; running the government of South Africa. In the eyes of many of their impatient and expectant followers the political changes that have taken place are no more than cosmetic. And as it became apparent at Codesa that the government was determined to resist ANC demands for a majority rule constitution and insist on what amounts to a white veto, it was only a matter of time before the frustrations turned into violence. But for all the anger it is hard to see that Mr Mandela has any choice but eventually to return to the negotiating table: the ANC is outgunned by the security forces, and trade sanctions are a dead letter. And ANC talk of the 'Leipzig option' - overwhelming the government by putting millions of demonstrators on the street - is treated sceptically by government. Officials acknowledge the capacity of the ANC and trade unions to conduct a successful one- or two-day stay-away, but doubt that this or any other 'mass action' can be sustained for much longer. For President F W de Klerk, however, having the upper hand - for the time being at least - would be a Pyrrhic victory. Only peace and stability, his officials concede, can bring about the economic recovery the country desperately needs. Nevertheless, the government is open to charges of complacency or over-confidence, which events of the past week will have shaken. The ANC's accusation that the government would respond differently if whites were being slaughtered is undeniable. The failure to seal off hostels for migrant workers, often located in the heart of troubled areas, is one key example of apparent indifference. According to Mr Mandela, Mr de Klerk promised in May last year to phase out hostels, replacing them with family accommodation, and to fence them off in the meantime. Nothing has been done. ANC criticism that the government has failed to ban so-called traditional weapons is also valid. While no one forecasts an early resumption of talks, it may well be that the minds of the main protagonists will have been concentrated by a week which contained all the ingredients of the country's nightmare scenario, in which industrial action, the bloody rivalry between the ANC and the mainly Zulu Inkatha Freedom party, and trigger-happy South African police combine to tip the country towards ungovernability.

Mr Kangai said it was part of government policy to ""develop  indigenous commercial farmers"".    The minister also confirmed reports that the first farm to  be  seized in terms of the controversial Land Acquisition Act was  initially intended for 33 peasant farmers from an overcrowded  neighbouring communal land but was instead leased to Minister of  Education Witness Mangwende.    The law allows the government to force white farmers to sell  their land and denies them the right to sue for unfair  compensation.    Mr Mangwende was the agriculture minister two years ago who  bulldozed the policy into law, leading President Robert Mugabe's  ""revolutionary"" land policy to correct imbalances in land  distribution.    Some 4,000 white farmers own 11 million hectares of land.    Mr Kangai who faced the press on the scandal for the first  time on Wednesday, said the government's resettlement policy was  ""very clear"" in securing land not only for peasants, but also  for people who happened to be senior government officials.    The government was in the process of ""addressing the  disparity of the position, and developing the indigenous  commercial farmer"", Mr Kangai said. ""Mangwende happened to be  an individual who had an application on our file,"" he said.    ""For that farm, for the people who applied, he was the most  suitable. There is nothing wrong with that,"" he added.    Mr Kangai insisted Mr Mangwende had met ""the right  criteria"".    When charged that a similar case in Britain would have  resulted in the responsible cabinet minister being fired, Mr  Kangai replied, ""I am glad I am not in the UK"".     "

[Mandela] Well, I did not actually have to pinch myself, but  perhaps I did the same thing, because when I saw those lines of  people ready to vote, my emotions were stirred and I thought  that we are going through an unforgettable moment.    [Dimbleby] Something you thought you would never see?    [Mandela] Well, I have never really lost hope that this day  would come, but I must immediately qualify that because there  were periods when the enemy, as we called them at the time,  appeared to be on top and appeared to have crushed the  resistance, but those were few and far between. Throughout, our  morale was very high and we felt imprisoned, but one day we  would return and the people would be victorious. In that  regard, the international community played a tremendous role,  because we felt throughout that the enemy was completely  isolated, we had the support of the entire world, and in that  situation, whatever problem you had, ultimately you would win in  the end.    [Dimbleby] Now you are a keep-fit fanatic, you do your  morning press-ups, do you expect to be leading the ANC in five  years time, into the next election?    [Mandela] Oh yes, on one condition, on condition that my  people want me to lead.    [Dimbleby] Because most people in this country think that  you  are the only person that can guarantee continued peaceful  transition, don't they?    [Mandela] Well that is a very flattering opinion, but I must  say that we have a gifted, committed leadership that would like  to serve the people of South Africa as a whole, not just the  members of the ANC, and the leaders themselves will come and go  but the organization is committed to a specific policy that we  have worked out and published, and on the basis of which we will  come into power.    [Dimbleby] Of course you have dropped, during the course of  making that policy, many of our more radical proposals that  cannot have particularly pleased the communists and the trade  unionists in the ANC. If this plan begins to falter, does not  quite work, do you expect the ANC to revert to radicalism?    [Mandela] I do not have any pessimism in my heart. I am  influenced by optimistic ideas as to our future. It is not  correct that you would think there was any difference of opinion  between the members of the South African Communist Party and  COSATU [Confederation of South African Trade Unions] in regard  to the program that we have worked out.    [Dimbleby] At the moment?    [Mandela] At the moment.    [Dimbleby] But things can change.    [Mandela] Well, things can always change and we cannot  predict the future. The point is, at the present moment we are  unanimous as to the priorities that have to be attended to. All  of us, the ANC, the South African Communist Party, COSATU, are  committed to this policy.    [Dimbleby] Chris Hani always said that the great danger when  the ANC came into power was that it would lose touch with its  grass roots. How are you going to stop your party becoming  fat-cats?    [Mandela] Well, first, this program, the reconstruction and  development program, was developed together with the masses of  people in people's forums. That is a very effective method of  exercising democracy where it is the masses of the people that  are telling the leaders what should be done, instead of the  leaders telling the people what should be done.    [Dimbleby] So you think the poor people in South Africa, the  poor blacks who just voted for you were in favor of the  concessions you have made to the bankers and the businessmen in  the course of these negotiations?    [Mandela] All that the people are interested in is: Will we  have jobs tomorrow; will we have hopes; will there be free,  universal, compulsory education; will we have hospitals and  clinics; will we have electricity in our homes, running water;  will we have paved streets; that is all they are interested in.    [Dimbleby] And if they do not get that they will turn away  from you.    [Mandela] If they do not get that they will be entitled to  throw out the ANC government. I will be with them in that. If  they feel the ANC has failed to deliver the goods, I will be at  the head of a march to overthrow the ANC government. We are  there to carry out a specific mandate. What is going to happen  when the results of the elections have been made is to ensure  that the masses of the people -- contrary to the legacy of the  past -- are involved as to how to address their basic needs,  what the first steps to be taken in each particular region and  in this particular locality are to address these problems.    [Dimbleby] Is it a greater fear for you that the mass of  the people, as you put it, the mass of black people become  disaffected with the ANC, or that whites start to leave this  country because of the measures that you take?    [Mandela] No, this plan that we have published, that we have  drafted five times, has been widely circulated among a wide  range of opinion makers, including business, academic, state  corporations, state departments, a wide variety of  organizations, and the five drafts that we have contained the  (commitments), and therefore there is no reason for any  particular population group in this country to leave the country  because of this program, because working up front in placing it  before the country and accommodating the fears and concerns of  all communities. We have had a meeting with Oppenheimer and his  colleagues to discuss this document, they have made certain  suggestions, we are planning another meeting next week. We have  been up front in insuring that that plan should receive the  support of everybody who is going to be important in bringing  about economic stability in this country, generate wealth and  insure that there are job opportunities, job creation in this  country.    [Dimbleby] Of course whites might leave if they felt life  was  too violent here -- as it was up until the last few days. Do  you believe the third force that you often talked about  allegedly exists, do you believe that is still a threat?    [Mandela] Oh yes, it is, and in fact a democratic government  that is able to say to the security forces, the crimes you have  committed before 8 October 1990, provided you make a full  disclosure within a specified time, say four to six months, we  will be able to pardon you, to give you an indemnity. If you  continue to say that those who have committed offenses between 8  October 1990 to December 1993, their case is at the discretion  of the new government, of the new parliament, we will examine it  on merit.    [Dimbleby] But will your first action be a clamp down on the  right-wingers who have been bombing and the people who you think  still threaten security in this country?    [Mandela] I do not think that that is an important matter.  The police are quite sufficient to deal with the right-wing.  They are a tiny minority and I do not think we should exonerate  them. To clamp down on them, to bend them, is to give them an  importance that they do not deserve. Well, look at the way the  police have dealt with the bombers -- they put an end to it. It  might still occur but they have nipped it in the bud and I think  we should congratulate the South African police for having done  such an excellent job.    [Dimbleby] How would you judge your success, or failure 12  months from now?    [Mandela] Well, my success or failure will first be judged  on  the basis of whether we have carried out the reconstruction and  development program and have started to meet the basic needs of  the people. Second, it will be judged on the basis of whether  we have been able to remove the concerns and the fears of the  minority groups, especially the whites. It will be judged on  the basis of whether we have made progress in creating this  environment of national reconciliation and nationhood, of  bringing about peace in our country, whether we have been able  to involve the religious groups who are concerned with the  maintenance of high moral standards, whether we are able to show  that they have an unimpeded government in order to insure that  corruption, covert operations are eliminated and that these high  moral standards are maintained in government.    [Dimbleby] Mr. Mandela, thank you very much. [passage  omitted]     "

Mr. Mugabe explained that the task  force, consisting of representatives of Governments of Botswana,  South Africa, and Zimbabwe will work out the possibility of a  program of action to be taken by the three countries. He  declined to discuss the composition of the task force but  stressed that it was to assess the situation in Lesotho, which  may mean the task force could visit Lesotho as it will be based  in South Africa.    Lesotho's deputy prime minister, Mr. Boholo, briefed the  three heads of state and Mr. Mandela about the situation in  Lesotho. President Mugabe described the situation in Lesotho as  a disturbance that threatened the democratic process in that  country. President Mugabe said Lesotho's prime minister, Dr.  Ntsu Mokhehle, had asked the secretary general of the  Commonwealth, Chief Emeka Anyaoku, to approach the Frontline  States to assist in resolving the crisis. He said Chief Anyaoku  approached him as the chairman of the Frontline States about the  matter, and he in turn approached President Masire as SADC  [Southern African Development Community] chairman, and the two  invited the two South African leaders.

Later Mr de Klerk said: 'We have reached the stage where we are close to solving the outstanding problems, which would result in real negotiations beginning.' Discussions would continue today, he added. The ANC has said it will suspend talks from today unless the government meets its demands on ending the township violence which has left more than 1,500 people dead in the Johannesburg area since last August. Neither side released details of the talks, which took place in Pretoria. Both made important concessions in the days leading up to today's deadline; but the issue of violence, which has severely damaged the ANC's support in black communities, is an emotive one and neither side will be keen to appear to back down. The gap between the two sides on the issue of violence has narrowed considerably since the ANC issued an ultimatum last month, calling for a ban on carrying weapons in public, disbanding counter-insurgency units, abolition of hostels, disciplining of policemen involved in killings, curbs on police crowd control methods, setting up a public inquiry into violence and the sacking of the ministers of defence and law and order. On Tuesday Mr de Klerk appeared to gain concessions from Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, leader of the Zulu Inkatha Party, on the issue after summoning him to Cape Town.

The  meeting starts on Thursday [2 June].    On Friday, Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe will host what  is expected to be the final meeting of the Frontline states, the  regional alliance of southern African nations which opposed  apartheid. Officials said leaders of the seven-nation grouping  would discuss a new organisation to replace it.    Already in Harare is Benin leader Nicephore Soglo who hosted  the previous GCA meeting in June last year. Due to arrive on  Wednesday are the heads of state of Angola, Namibia, Mozambique,  Tanzania, Zambia, Ghana, Ethiopia, Mali, Eritrea, Ivory Coast  and Botswana, and former World Bank head Robert MacNamara and  former Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere.    Founded with World Bank finance and based in Washington, the  GCA was established as an alliance of African nations and  Western donor nations with close ties to the continent. It was  part of a bid to counter a shift of Western financial support  from Africa after the fall of the Communist bloc. Backers  describe it as dedicated to ""keeping alive the good news in  Africa"".    Frontline heads of state are expected to support moves to  keep the body alive in spite of the transition to democracy in  South Africa. However, the group is expected to change its  ""confrontational"" name and adopt a new direction, working for  peace and political stability in the region and to provide a  forum for conflict mediation.

It is not the press which imposed the recent array of fines on many leading life companies for contravening the regulations, designed to protect consumers; nor is it the press which suspended the entire Norwich Union direct salesforce; nor did financial journalists invent the home income scandal, the personal pensions scandal or the statistics showing that one third of life policies lapse within two years. It is the life assurance industry itself which has, by its unprincipled disregard for the best interests of the public, earned its present appalling reputation. An expression of deep regret and a promise of urgent reform would have been the more appropriate response. The public has reason to be grateful to financial journalists for their incisive reportage, which has stirred the regulators into taking a measure of effective action to protect consumers against the activities of many life companies. As a result, standards are beginning to improve but there is a very long way to go. Financial journalists can make a further contribution to speeding up the process by raising the question of accountability. Clearly it is the directors and management of life offices that should be held accountable for their companies' selling malpractices, rather than the individual sales people. The long-awaited change in regulation will begin with miraculous speed on the day the regulators take public action against chief executives of life offices which blatantly disregard their regulations.

Opposition parties  claim that neither minister remains completely untainted by the  scandal surrounding the disbanding of the IRT [Interregional  Investigation Team] criminal investigation unit.    The IRT, which operated in the provinces of North Holland  and  Utrecht between 1987 and the end of last year, was unfairly  disbanded according to a report made public on Thursday [24  March]. According to the Netherlands national investigation  unit, it was incorrect to claim that the special police unit was  shut down owing to its ""controversial methods,"" as Hirsch, on  advice from the public prosecutor and the Amsterdam police, had  reported to Parliament in January.    In its report, the national investigation unit described the  actions of the team as ""well-considered, careful, and  responsible."" The national investigation unit believes the real  reasons for disbanding the team to be the result of jealousy:  The heads of the Amsterdam criminal investigation unit wanted  to do away with the IRT as it could not accept its independence.    Van Thijn, former mayor of Amsterdam, does not want to  accept  any resignations of senior members of the public prosecutor's  office or the Amsterdam police. Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers is  of the same opinion.    The liberal opposition parties, the VVD [People's Party for  Freedom and Democracy] and D66 [Democrats 66], together with the  Ecologist Left opposition, are demanding a full explanation of  this police affair. ""Seldom has the belief in the ability to  successfully combat organized crime suffered such a blow,""  stated D66 spokesman Kohnstamm.     "

The row has been simmering since last Wednesday when Tv5, one of Fininvest's three national television channels, announced that Milan magistrates had sought authorisation to arrest six senior Fininvest executives. The arrests were allegedly connected to the payment of undeclared sums on the transfer to cup-winning AC Milan of Turin's prize player 'Gigi' Lentini in 1992. Milan magistrates immediately claimed the news had been deliberately leaked and took possession of a copy of the Tv5 video of the announcement. They suspected the news was made public to avoid high profile arrests of persons linked to Mr Berlusconi at a sensitive moment in the campaign for the March 27 general elections. Yesterday, the magistrates interrogated a Tv5 journalist about the leak, a day after a Milan judge declined a request for the arrest of the six Fininvest officials. It was later announced that the journalist was formally under investigation for aiding and abetting. The officials included Mr Marcello Dell'Utri, the head of Publitalia, the advertising arm of Fininvest, and the organisational core around which Mr Berlusconi's Forza Italia political movement has been built. Mr Dell'Utri is part of Mr Berlusconi's inner circle and is widely credited with having helped persuade Mr Berlusconi to enter the political ring. Mr Berlusconi himself has claimed he and Fininvest are being persecuted by the Milan magistrates in a political vendetta. However, yesterday the magistrates let it be known they were continuing their investigations into the transfer operations of AC Milan. A former head of Turin football club has alleged that at least L6bn (Pounds 2.43m) was paid through foreign banks to secure the Lentini transfer  - on top of the sum officially declared.

0,FT922-3384 ,"FT922-3384 _AN-CFKBHAE3FT 920611   FT  11 JUN 92 / Arts: Dejavu - Theatre      By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD   Just over 25 years on, John Osborne has done it again. Dejavu is not Look Back in Anger, nor is it meant to be, but it has every claim to become the most talked about play in London. The only reservation apart from the length  -a good three hours - and the uncertainty about how to bring it to an end is whether you need to know the earlier piece in order to enjoy the latter. My guess is that Dejavu just about stands in its own right, though a thorough grounding in Look Back would help the appreciation immeasurably. Osborne has forgotten nothing since the height of his powers. A quarter of a century later, Jimmy Porter and Cliff are still there, relatively affluent now and with Jimmy tending to be known as JP. The change is that instead of Alison, Jimmy's wife, there is now Alison, his daughter, and instead of Helena, his wife's friend, there is now Helena, the friend of his daughter. The rest of the plot, if you remember it, is much the same right down to the use of the ironing board and the switch of allegiance. Apart from the sheer pleasure of seeing Look Back revisited, there are two fundamental reasons why this production by Tony Palmer works so well. One is that Osborne at his best is such a brilliant stage-writer: the words and the allusions come tumbling out, joke after joke. The other is that this Jimmy Porter - the ageing John Osborne in all but name - is played by the youngish actor, Peter Egan. The decision to go for Egan in the end rather than some older hand like Peter O'Toole is crucial to the success. It means that even when JP is at his most cantankerous and bilious, he still has a youthful charm. The danger of playing him like a stereotype - angry young man turned reactionary fogey  -has been avoided. Although Egan appears to get through enormous quantities of red wine and champagne in the course of the show, it never seems that it is wholly the drink that is talking. This is Porter Senior reflecting on Porter Junior: curiously enough he tends to the conclusion that the generation of the 1950s had it better. Jimmy looks younger than Cliff (Gareth Thomas), as perhaps he always was at heart. What the pair of them still have in common, however, is the ability to turn on a double act. The two man cabaret show is at the heart of their performance. Where Osborne scores, just as he did in Look Back and also in The Entertainer, is in mixing the corniest of old music hall jokes with the most literary. Some of the awfullest old lines are repeated, like 'my feet hurt' - 'why not try washing your socks?' Then we are off with 'Auntie Wordsworth'. Osborne's language is steeped in Shakespeare virtually every other line. Remember that team of comics, Jock and Day, who stood tiptoe on the misty mountain top? This mock-literary stuff is the preferred home of Jimmy and Cliff. They were, as one of them says in Dejavu, camp before anyone knew what it meant. There are also the Osborne swipes at fashionable trends. JP has become a wine snob, and uses the language to dismiss the Nicaragua '89. In the Osborne world there is now an A level in joined-up writing; for GCSEs you do Elton John since nobody has heard of T S Eliot. The local shopping precinct is called after Winnie Mandela. But the style is not repetitive because the jokes are so infinitely varied. There is a lot more besides. The Sunday papers are back: Osborne claims not unfairly to have invented the category 'posh'. The bears and squirrels of Look Back now appear regularly in the Valentine's Day messages in The Times. If the earlier work was seminal, this is an essential catch-up.

He joined BAT from Cambridge University in 1935. The company posted him to China where he remained until the outbreak of the second world war, during which he served in the Royal Air Force in the Middle East, Burma and Italy. On his return to BAT in 1946 he rose swiftly through the ranks. He was appointed to the board in 1955, became vice-chairman in 1968 and was made chairman in 1970, a post he held until 1976. Knighted that year, he was president until 1979. It was as chairman that his particular skills came to the attention of British Leyland. He was a tough team player in a diversifying multi-national group facing increasing pressure from the anti-smoking lobby. Sir Richard remained an unrepentant smoker of both pipes and cigarettes. British Leyland was at that time a state-owned company in all but name. So the appointment of a keen advocate of private enterprise attracted considerable publicity. But that was nothing compared with the controversy that surrounded his enforced departure only 18 months later. In a speech to a businessmen's supper club in September 1977, Sir Richard referred to 'wogs' as the recipients of BL bribes, and called trade unions 'bastards'. The leftwing son of a club member taped his remarks, and a Marxist journal called Socialist Challenge printed them. The Labour government found the ensuing scandal too hard to pass off as simply embarrassing. Sir Richard resigned. Sir Richard was also on the board of Exxon from 1975-84. He is survived by his wife Betty and one stepdaughter.   Companies:-  BAT Industries.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P99   Nonclassifiable Establishments.

The main opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which  set  the submission as a condition to start deliberations of the  fiscal 1994 state budget at the House of Representatives budget  committee, reacted angrily, with the result that debates on the  budget are likely to be delayed until later this month, Diet  sources said.    Chiefs of the Diet affairs committee from the coalition  parties and the LDP met in the afternoon in order to reach  agreement on the opening of debate on the 73.08 trillion yen  budget. The negotiations, however, broke off after Hosokawa  rejected the LDP demand, the sources said.    The LDP decided not to attend Wednesday's scheduled meeting  of senior members of the budget committee, which will discuss a  timetable to deliberate the national budget for fiscal 1994 that  starts April 1, LDP officials said.    The government last Friday submitted to the panel documents  relating to the loan but the LDP and the Japanese Communist  Party (JCP) were not satisfied, saying the submissions were  insufficient, and renewed their demands that the government  offer further detailed materials.    Hosokawa has insisted he borrowed the 100 million yen from  Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin in 1982 to repair his home in Kumamoto  Prefecture and buy a condominium in Tokyo, and fully repaid the  money nine years later.    The parcel delivery firm was involved in a money-and-mob  scandal which forced LDP kingpin Shin Kanemaru to resign in  disgrace in 1992.    Hosokawa maintains he repaid the money by January 31, 1991,  using part of his retirement allowance as Kumamoto governor.  But the LDP argues that Hosokawa could not have received the  retirement allowance before finishing his second term as  governor in February 1991.     "

JANA's international affairs editor has commented on those  reports saying: Such statements have revealed that the American  President was under pressures from the Jewish lobby in America.  It was the Jews who initiated the Whitewater scandal and they  implicated Clinton in it, and because of its repercussions,  which have increased his fears for his political future as  president, the American President is now trying to side fully  with them. However, the victims of such a support will be,  without any doubts, the Arabs, as usual.    The American President's announcement that he supported the  idea of Jerusalem as the united and eternal capital of the  Zionist entity was like a new Belfort [name as received]  Declaration, through which he who did not own gave to whom who  did not deserve. If the American President wanted to give  something to the Jews why doesn't he give them his wife,  Washington, or New York for example; Jerusalem is an Arab city  and he has nothing to with it.    JANA's international affairs editor wondered, however: Where  the Arabs were, at time they can see that their capitals were  being sold to or just given away in order to win the Jews'  amity? Where are those who have been singing pan-Arabism, Islam  praises, and lifting the banner of martyrdom at a time when they  can see Christians showing contempt to their holy places and  legitimizing their usurpation by the Jews?.    The editor added: The time to sort out who is who has  arrived  because matters have become clear; any Arab, who stands with  America, is an infidel. Arabs ought to carry out Jihad; they  have every right to martyrdom for the sake of their land and  their rights.     "

The ANC had a successful start to its mass action campaign yesterday, with most black workers observing Soweto Day by not going to work, and no reports of intimidation or violence related to the stayaway, Philip Gawith reports from Johannesburg. All the main cities reported large stayaway figures. The Johannesburg Chamber of Commerce and Industry said 89 per cent of city employees stayed away from work. June 16, the day the Soweto riots began in 1976, is traditionally observed as a public holiday by the black community, so it was difficult to gauge the response to the ANC's call for mass action. Many companies have negotiated June 16 as a paid holiday for their workers. The streets of Johannesburg were devoid of the normal bustle of hawkers, black-run taxis and pedestrians. Soweto, by contrast, was a hive of activity, much of it centred on the Orlando stadium for the main rally of 70 the ANC organised around the country yesterday. A capacity crowd heard Mr Mandela say mass action would continue so long as there was no progress at Codesa, the forum for constitutional negotiations which have become deadlocked. Later, unknown gunmen opened fire on pedestrians and motorists in townships around Johannesburg, killing 12 people. Speaking yesterday in Ulundi, capital of the KwaZulu 'homeland', President F W de Klerk said the government was anxious to move to power sharing in the shortest possible time, but would not be bulldozed into an unsuitable constitution.

It quoted an unidentified ""high-ranking Russian official"" as  saying that ""given the wish, it is possible to spotlight  American diplomats working for the CIA and Russians  collaborating with the secret service.""    The U.S. Government has instituted judicial proceedings  against Aldrich Hazen Ames, the former chief of the CIA's Soviet  Counter-Intelligence Branch, and his wife Maria, charging them  with spying for the former Soviet Union and Russia.    Ames, 52, a CIA employee for more than 31 years, and his  wife, Maria Del Rosario Casa Ames, 41, a Colombian-born  naturalized U.S. citizen, were arrested on Monday by CIA and FBI  agents.    According to the U.S. Department of Justice, the Ames couple  have been spying against the U.S. since 1985 and received more  than 1.5 million U.S. dollars in payoff money and deposited the  money on accounts in U.S. and foreign banks.    The investigation of the case started 10 months ago. U.S.  President Bill Clinton described it as ""a very serious case"" and  ordered the State Department to lodge an official protest to the  Russian Government.    Yuri Kobaladze, spokesman for the Russian Foreign  Intelligence Service, said on Wednesday that the spy scandal  over the Ames couple might has been revealed to discredit the  success of the Russian foreign policy in resolving the Sarajevo  crisis.    Russian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Grigoriy Karashin stated,  meanwhile, that ""much has to be cleared up.""    In a statement delivered earlier Wednesday, Russian  Presidential Spokesman Vyacheslav Kostikov said, ""a return to  the psychology of the Cold War, mounting mistrust, and a new  wave of spy mania would contradict the ideas of international  partnership for peace.""

0,FT941-15356 ,"FT941-15356 _AN-EAPAGABRFT 940115   FT  15 JAN 94 / Leading Article: Watchdogs are required   This has been another week that the Conservative government would rather forget. It began with a wave of scandal breaking around the government's supporters in Parliament. This ebbed somewhat with the announcement of the death of Lady Caithness, wife of the junior transport minister whose marriage was said to be in difficulty. But confusion has continued over exactly what the prime minister meant with his back to basics campaign. Even if he did not mean it to apply to ministers' behaviour, Conservative party members seem to think that it should. Mr Major has looked indecisive in his unwillingness to enforce the new morality on his own ministers. The week ended with accusations of gerrymandering in the London Borough of Westminster. This flagship of Conservative local government was feted throughout the 1980s for its slick management and entrepreneurialism. According to the district auditor, it was also using public money for electoral advantage. Council flats were sold and homeless families ejected from marginal wards to keep the borough Conservative. More bad weeks are likely to follow. Taxpayers will feel the impact of hefty tax increases announced in the last two Budgets at the start of the new financial year in April. Local authority elections in May will provide an early opportunity for the voters in London and other urban areas to register dissatisfaction. And Conservative expectations for the European elections in June are already being talked down. On Monday, Mr Major must appear in front of the Scott inquiry, which is investigating the scandal over the sale of arms to Iraq. The public interrogation of the prime minister by such a tribunal is unprecedented in recent British history. It is also likely to prove an uncomfortable experience - as a succession of serving and former cabinet ministers have already found. Best way Lord Howe, the former foreign secretary, voiced the concern of senior officials this week when he accused Lord Justice Scott of acting as 'detective, inquisitor, advocate and judge'. Yet the inquiry's procedures are the best way to uncover the truth in a reasonable time to the satisfaction of the public. When the inquiry's report appears later in the year, it must be able to explain how three businessmen came to be prosecuted for selling arms to Iraq when they had done it with the encouragement of a government department. There is, of course, nothing new in duplicity, deceit or corruption in government. It is arguable that the democratic process is based on a potentially corrupt bargain between voters and politicians. The latter bid for the former's support by promising higher incomes, lower taxes or more 'free' services. The voters award the prize to the politicians who makes the best and most plausible offer. Those who fail to deliver, however, can expect to be found out and penalised in future elections. Dividing line And it will always be tempting for politicians to use the power of government to improve their chances of holding on to it. Herbert Morrison, the Labour leader of the old London county council, bragged that he would 'build the Conservatives out of London' by building council homes for Labour-voting tenants. Many Conservatives believed that selling council homes to their tenants would convert them into Tory voters. But while the dividing line between legitimate housing policy and gerrymandering can be a fine one, it can be drawn. If a council builds homes or sells them off with the objective of changing the voting patterns of marginal wards, that line has been crossed. The dangers that power will be abused increase when there are long periods of single-party rule. Parties which face no real challenge at the ballot box increasingly discount the legislative niceties. Policy changes over arms sales which could be embarrassing internationally are slipped through without bothering to tell Parliament. Ministers avoid telling lies - but they do not feel obliged to tell the whole truth either. They appoint their own supporters to key posts in quangos or to plum jobs in local government. Their officials forget their duty to serve the public good and become enmeshed in party politics. The checks and balances need to be cultivated and strengthened in one-party states, whether at local or national level. Much more information needs to be provided about decisions, for example, so that secrecy does not conceal corruption. An appointments commission should oversee the thousands of appointments to the growing numbers of quangos. Protecting the independence of public servants from undue political pressures may require new measures, including an independent appeals procedure if they feel pressured to act improperly. Above all, close scrutiny of the executive is required. The district auditor has proved his worth. The Audit Commission, the National Audit Office and the various ombudsmen can all help in preserving standards. The press, too, has a role to play.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

The arrests eased pressure on president FW de Klerk who has come under mounting criticism for failing to act swiftly against the right. Police would not release the names of those arrested. It was not clear whether the rightwing leaders who openly led the attack - well-known politicians such as Mr Ferdi Hartzenberg, leader of the rightwing Conservative Party and head of the official parliamentary opposition, along with Mr Eugene Terreblanche, the leader of the neo-Nazi Afrikaner Resistance Movement (AWB),and General Constand Viljoen, head of the Afrikaner Volksfront, an umbrella right-wing group - had been arrested. Mr de Klerk had promised arrests within 24 hours of the attack, which saw leading politicians chased through the corridors of the constitutional conference centre by armed men from the AWB. Police said arrests were delayed by the fact that suspects had given them false names, an explanation dismissed as ridiculous by Mr Nelson Mandela, leader of the African National Congress. Mr Mandela said last night the ANC was ready for violence from the right: 'If the rightwing thinks that they can use coercion and intimidation to get what they are unable to get through negotiation, they are making a serious mistake . . . And if they are thinking in terms of violence, we are ready for that. We would not like to talk along those terms, but we are not going to allow anybody to impose his will on the people of South Africa.' Constitutional talks were due to continue this week despite the attack. Harry Oppenheimer, Page 30   Countries:-  ZAZ   South Africa, Africa.   Industries:-  P9229 Public Order and Safety, NEC.

JACKSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER      WASHINGTON      The guilty plea Wednesday of Iran-Contra figure Richard V. Secord was hailed by  federal prosecutors as closing an important chapter in their yearslong  investigation of the scandal.    Reid H. Weingarten, who was to try Secord on 12 felony charges beginning next  Monday, told reporters that the former Air Force major general's admission that  he lied to Congress in 1987 was ""a significant step in this office's effort to  expeditiously and fully complete its work.""    Weingarten's boss, independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh, said in a separate  statement that Secord's plea ""brings within an adequate range of punishment one  of the principal participants in the Iran-Contra diversion.""    Under terms of the plea bargain disclosed in federal court, Secord, 56, who  assisted former White House aide Oliver L. North in supplying weapons to  Nicaragua's rebels, pleaded guilty to one felony count of lying to Congress in  return for dismissal of the 11 other counts in his indictment.    He also agreed to ""cooperate fully"" with Walsh's office by testifying at future  trials or grand jury proceedings.    The principal two trials remaining are those of former White House National  Security Adviser John M. Poindexter, North's one-time superior, starting next  Jan. 22, and Albert A. Hakim, Secord's former business partner, whose trial  date has not been set.    Sources said that Secord's plea places Hakim under new pressure to enter a plea  himself. Officials would not comment on whether such a plea is expected today  at a pretrial hearing for Hakim. Richard Janis, Hakim's attorney, declined to  discuss the matter.    Chief U.S. District Judge Aubrey E. Robinson Jr., who accepted Secord's plea,  set no immediate date for sentencing him. But he reminded Secord that he faces  a maximum possible term of five years in prison.    Lawyers familiar with plea bargains said that Secord got a standard settlement  -- admitting one felony count in return for dismissal of the remaining charges.    ""Most judges make sentences on additional counts run concurrently anyway, so  the government benefits whenever it gets someone to plead to a felony without  the risks and expenses that a trial entails,"" one attorney said.    During the investigation of the Watergate scandal in the Richard M. Nixon  Administration, it was standard procedure for special prosecutors to try to  negotiate guilty pleas to one felony, with the understanding that such  defendants would testify for the government against others.    Watergate figures who accepted such plea bargains included former White House  aides John W. Dean III and Egil (Bud) Krogh Jr. and former Nixon campaign  officials Herbert L. Porter and Frederick C. LaRue.    Earlier in the Iran-Contra investigation, Robert C. McFarlane -- another former  national security adviser to former President Ronald Reagan -- was required to  plead guilty to four separate charges of misleading Congress. But they were  misdemeanors rather than felonies.    Traditionally, judges try to encourage the settlement of criminal cases by  giving more lenient sentences to defendants who plead guilty. Plea bargains  save the government the time and expense of trying every defendant who is  indicted.    At his court appearance, Secord told Judge Robinson that he had lied by  responding ""no"" when congressional investigators asked him under oath: ""Are you  aware of any money from the Enterprise (North's code word for the Iran-Contra  operation) which went to the benefit of Mr. North?""    Standing erect before Robinson with hands clasped behind his back, Secord said  he gave his false answer ""in a misguided effort . . . to protect Mr. North and  myself.""    Prosecutors said in court papers that ""if called to prove this (perjury)  allegation at trial, the government would prove that defendant (Secord) knew  that, in fact, money from the Enterprise went to North's benefit as the result  of defendant's purchase of a security system costing in excess of $13,000 and  the establishment of a secret account containing $200,000 in Switzerland for  North"" for the education of his children.    Stressing the venal side of the Iran-Contra case, the government's court filing  said further that Secord personally had received $1.5 million in profits from  the sale of weapons to Iran and the Contras. It added that Hakim ""received  profits in comparable amounts.""    A federal court jury last May convicted North on three of 12 felony counts,  including his acceptance of a $13,800 gratuity from Secord, an electronic  security fence at his Virginia home.    North was not charged with accepting the $200,000 education fund, although it  figured in trial testimony. Prosecutors said in their new filing that Secord  had informed North in 1986 that he and Hakim had established such a fund.    Secord and Hakim gave these gifts to North ""at least in part to thank him for  providing lucrative financial opportunities"" for them, prosecutors charged.    Thomas C. Green, Secord's attorney, replied that the home security system was  ""not an attempt to thank Col. North."" Rather, Secord paid for the installation  ""to respond to threats against Col.

Those involved in it are not ordinary  candidates: They are D. Bednyakov, acting mayor of Nizhniy  Novgorod; Ye. Krestyaninov, a senator and former oblast soviet  chairman; and indirectly--Governor B. Nemtsov.    The scandal began to flare up when D. Bednyakov  and Ye. Krestyaninov both decided to run for city  mayor. The governor supported the latter. Apparently for this  reason the rivals accused them both of corruption and  connections with the mafia. Apparently not wishing to  participate in a slugfest, Ye. Krestyaninov removed himself from  the mayoral race, and the elections did not take place  altogether.    D. Bednyakov, however, also was running for the oblast Duma.  Elections in his Electoral District No. 3 were declared invalid,  however, since fewer than 25 percent of valid ballots had been  cast. Later, in clear violation of procedure, a recount was  conducted and... found a sufficient number of votes. The initial  data were destroyed. The procuracy began an investigation. This  actually was the high point of the scandal.    It was preceded by another, however--abuses that occurred  during the privatization of GAZ [Gorkiy Auto Works], the largest  Russian automotive giant. The plant leadership was accused of  illegally buying up vouchers for subsequent privatization.  Governor B. Nemtsov, among others, brought up the subject of the  illegality of such operations.    Whether by accident or not, after this incident allegations  of corruption began to fly with respect to both the governor and  his confederates. At the same time, the GAZ leadership openly  supports acting Mayor D. Bednyakov. So far, however, the  fight for influence in the oblast has been contained in the  boundaries of election-related scandals.     "

Mr Ramaphosa welcomed IFP delegates back to the MPNC which  was sitting to consider constitutional amendments on the future  of Zulu king goodwill Zwelithini. The amendments were agreed  upon by IFP President Mangosuthu Buthelezi, ANC President Nelson  Mandela and President F W de Klerk on Tuesday.    While welcoming the IFP back, Mr Ramaphosa said the cost of  the IFP's return had been high.

""The cost of  bringing back the IFP into the election process has been very  high for our people,"" Mr Ramaphosa said.    He said a statement by IFP negotiator Walter Felgate that  the  IFP had deliberately played hard to get until the latest  possible moment and had been worth millions of rands, made his  heart bleed.    South African Communist Party Chairman Joe Slovo said he  hoped the IFP was entering the election with a view to accepting  the results. In a reference to kwaZulu's separatist notions, Mr  Slovo said a ""Savimbi option had no future in South Africa.    Mr Felgate said the IFP was not entering the elections on a  conditional basis and was totally committed to the electoral  process. He said the IFP would work for peace and for a  successful election. He said he had been quoted selectively  about the publicity value of the IFP's strategy.     "

During an interview with the media that have accompanied him  on his visit to the Republic of South Africa, Fidel Castro said  Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos sincerely expressed  with ""heartfelt words that came from the bottom of his soul""  what the aid given by Cuba represented for his country.    Today, the two leaders held a meeting following the  inauguration of antiapartheid leader Nelson Mandela as South  African president, an event that shook the world on 10 May.  Referring to the meeting, the Cuban head of state said dos  Santos also told him that Cuban cooperation was important not  only for Angola but also for South Africa and the rest of that  vast continent. He added that dos Santos' words shook him when  he referred to the unselfish aid given by the Cuban people to  that region of the planet.

The plans, advanced by the finance ministry and leading state-owned financial institutions, envisage the creation of a Rs1bn (Dollars 32m) nationwide computer-based trading system for a wide range of financial instruments, including equities, bonds and short-term paper. The proposals are likely to provoke fierce battles in the financial community, with the institutions ranged against stockbrokers who see the plans as a threat to their business. Brokers also doubt whether such an ambitious scheme can be introduced rapidly in India, given the country's chronic shortages of telephone lines and other services vital for a national computer-based market. The government yesterday set out a tight timetable for the new exchange  - saying that money market instruments would be traded by the end of the current financial year in March 1994. Capital market instruments, including equities, would be introduced later. The government said in a statement that its aim was to ensure greater transparency and better protection for investors. 'The exchange will also help in bringing the Indian capital market in line with international markets,' it added. Government officials believe last year's Rs40bn Bombay securities market scandal highlighted many weaknesses in the existing stock markets, including unclear trading practices, poor book-keeping by brokers and late settlements. Even though the affair centred on the inter-bank market and not the stock exchange, stockbrokers played a key role in channelling funds illegally from banks into equity investments. The Securities and Exchange Board of India, the newly-appointed securities market watchdog, has been struggling in its efforts to bring greater discipline to the stock markets. Brokers complain that the authorities have been heavy-handed and have failed to understand the subtleties of stock trading.   Countries:-  INZ  India, Asia.

0,FT923-9007 ,"FT923-9007 _AN-CHKBOADEFT 920807   FT  07 AUG 92 / Leading Article: Stalemate in South Africa   THE AFRICAN National Congress has made its point. It should now return to the negotiating table. The trial of strength on the streets has ended in stalemate. Millions of Africans stayed away from work on Monday and Tuesday, either out of political conviction or as a result of intimidation. On Wednesday exuberant supporters of the ANC were addressed by Mr Nelson Mandela in the amphitheatre near government headquarters. President FW de Klerk evidently instructed his senior police officers to co-operate with the demonstration leaders, but this does not mean that further 'rolling mass action' would necessarily pass without setting off a violent explosion. In any event, continued negotiation by street theatre would be self-defeating. It would further weaken the republic's economy and deter foreign investors. It is, therefore, reasonable to expect that Mr Mandela will lead his party back into talks. That is the logical next step. The ANC has expressed its understandable anger at the killing of its people at Boipatong, allegedly by supporters of the Inkatha Freedom party. Recent reports have lent credence to charges that the lower ranks of the South African police have connived at, or taken part in, murders of ANC supporters. The number of deaths in police custody has been shown to be suspiciously high. The assertion that Mr de Klerk is either unable or unwilling to control his security forces has become increasingly difficult for him to refute. This puts his government back under the world spotlight. He is aware of this. South Africa has accepted 10 United Nations observers within its borders. The team is small, but its potential contribution as a facilitator of an eventual settlement is disproportionately large. Mr Cyrus Vance was instrumental in bringing about a pre-demonstration meeting between the South African government and the ANC, thus contributing to the apparently peaceful nature of this week's events and setting the scene for an early resumption of talks. Mr Vance is now expected to propose the establishment of a long-term UN presence in the republic, to monitor the progress of the national peace accord. This should be welcomed, but its potential should not be exaggerated. Outsiders such as the UN and the British individuals sent to assist into inquiries into police behaviour can help diminish the mistrust between the ANC and the government, but they cannot solve the fundamental problem that faces the two sides. This is that Mr Mandela's party demands majority rule while Mr de Klerk's insists on 'power-sharing' as a means of protecting minorities. A deal can be struck only when the ANC recognises that it cannot have total control over South Africa handed to it on a plate and the National party accepts that in the end constitutional safeguards for minorities cannot permanently and universally thwart the will of an elected majority. If South Africa is lucky, the perilous weeks now behind it will have served to concentrate the minds of those who must reach agreement - or face a future that a former prime minister once described as too ghastly to contemplate.

W.  de Klerk said on Wednesday [2 March]. He also revealed that he  had had discussions on Tuesday night with Afrikaner Volksfront  [National Front -- AVF] leader General Constand Viljoen.    Answering a question during state president's question time  from Mr Dave Dalling (ANC [African National Congress]-Sandton),  he said the government called on other parties to negotiate in  good faith and with a will to reach solutions. Although he was  very pleased that Tuesday's talks between ANC president Mr  Nelson Mandela and Inkatha Freedom Party leader Dr Mangosuthu  Buthelezi had taken place, it should be remembered they would  not have been possible without hours of discussions between he  and other senior government members like Home Affairs Minister  Mr Danie Schutte, and Dr Buthelezi.    It had therefore been possible to put specific proposals  before Tuesday's meeting. On his talks on Tuesday night with  Gen Viljoen, Mr de Klerk said: ""We don't make a public display  like the ANC (of such talks). With us results count.""    President de Klerk said April 27 remained the election date  -- ""I am a leader of a party which keeps its word.""    On proposed international mediation to address the  constitutional impasse with the Freedom Alliance [FA], he said  time was of the essence, and this could provide problems  regarding such mediation.    He would, however, examine any proposal. ""My government's  attitude is that negotiation doesn't end today.""    Multi-party accords could be reached in the next 10 days,  two  weeks, or whatever, on outstanding issues. Mr de Klerk said he  found the concept of provisional registration of parties  ""interesting"". Other FA parties should also look at it.     "

Cuban and South African Foreign Ministers Roberto Robaina  and  Alfred Nzo formalized a protocol that establishes a new stage in  relations between Pretoria and Havana today. The two governments  had no diplomatic relations to date because of our government  and people's rejection of the now-dismantled racist system of  apartheid.    Less than 48 hours after becoming president, Nelson Mandela,  leader of the African National Congress [ANC], raised the  relations of friendship and solidarity that have existed for  years between Cuba and the formerly proscribed ANC to the  government level.    During his visit to Pretoria, Castro said there have been  moments of strong confrontations in past bilateral relations  between Cuba and South Africa. Castro recalled Cuba's  internationalist position against the policy of apartheid  against the majority black populations of South Africa, Namibia,  and Angola -- a policy now overcome -- adding that there is now  a new South Africa, where there is peace, respect, and affection  toward Cuba.    Today, Fidel Castro, heading the Cuban delegation, will  conclude his first official and friendly visit to South Africa,  a visit that began on 9 May to attend the inauguration of Nelson  Mandela, the first black president of a country that has left  behind more than three centuries of racial discrimination now.    At the signing of the new document regarding diplomatic  relations, Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina was accompanied by  Angel Dalmau, Cuban ambassador to Namibia; Rosa Elena Simeon,  minister of Science, Technology, and Environment; and (Marcos  Rodriguez), who will represent our country in Pretoria  temporarily.

We have distributed a joint  statement, which no doubt you will interpret that it hides more  than it discloses. If that is your conclusion you are  absolutely right because that was the intention, not because we  have not had fruitful discussions, but because our discussions  in many senses of the word have not been completed. For that  reason we have appointed a task group with a specific  instruction. You might say, oh, another task group. [laughter]  I would like to say that this one is different in that it has  to report back in less than a week, to the leaders, and in that  there is an agreement for a follow-up meeting during which the  discussions will be taken further, and this is the main reason  why the statement is incomplete on all the burning issues, which  are not dealt with specifically in the statement.    I feel that we have made good progress in some respects  today. On the burning issue and the very important issue of the  accommodation and the full recognition of the monarchy of the  Zulu nation, of the Zulu kingdom, I am confident that this task  group will come up with good results because my perception is  that between our proposals, the proposals of the ANC, the  proposals from the side of Chief Minister Buthelezi and the  kwaZulu government, there is already discernible, a broad  consensus and that it is now a question of putting together the  how -- of the accommodation and recognition of the Zulu kingdom.  The fact that it is to be recognized, and that that is to be  done constitutionally, I think can be accepted as having been  fully established and that there is a broad consensus on that.    On some of the other issues I am disappointed that we  haven't  made more progress, but the door is not closed and discussions  will continue. There will now be a broadened basis of  discussion on the issue of mediation and mediation can play a  constructive and a positive role and the government will be  cooperative on the basis that we reach agreement on a number of  outstanding aspects affecting the issue of mediation. If we can  reach such agreement mediation can make a constructive  contribution towards bringing us nearer to solutions on many of  the substantive issues at stake. In general, I think we have  achieved today the beginning of a discussion and a continued  negotiation process between main role players which should have  started long ago. I have for many, many years been advocating a  meeting like the one we have had today and I'm glad that at last  it has taken place, and as far as the government and the  National Party is concerned, we will seek ways and means of  ensuring that also this important forum which has been brought  together today, will continue to operate and interact with each  other because there lies a heavy responsibility on the shoulders  of the four people and that which they represent in public life,  sitting before you. To a certain extent we have come to the  brink of a very serious situation, and our responsibility is to  through dialogue and negotiation, find ways and means to defuse  the issue in the province and to ensure that peace comes to all  the people of South Africa, and that the full opportunity for  all those who want to participate, to participate freely and  without fear, will be ensured and for those who choose the other  options, and that is not to participate, to also do so without  interference. Participation or not is a choice. It is part of  the democratic process, but the rights of those who want to  participate is as sacrosanct as the rights of those who don't  want to participate, and I'm glad that nothing has happened  today which in any way takes away from a previous agreement  reached between me and Chief Minister Buthelezi, that this  principle of free democratic organization for those who  participate and who don't participate, is an important principle  which should be upheld throughout our country in every inch and  every corner. Thank you very much ladies and gentlemen.    [Zwelethini] Well, from all that the state president has  been saying, I should say to the discussions that have taken  place in the meeting, which actually everybody has been ... has  been looking for, I'm so pleased that the meeting has taken  place today although some of my demands, as far as I'm  concerned, has never been met yet, but as far as this meeting is  concerned I hope that it's going to be very concerned about the  problems that have been accumulated in this country, especially  from the political parties whom actually their followers are in  a problem of fighting against each other, which I hope that  today, this meeting of today is going to show, especially to the  grassroots level, that the leaders themselves -- what do they  want from their own followers. So, I don't think there is  anything that I can say thereof, except that the joint press  statement for myself and the chief minister is going to be right  by him. Thank you.    [Buthelezi] Today his majesty, the king of the Zulu nation,  leaders of the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] and the ANC and the  South African Government and the National Party, and their  respective delegations met in a summit in a venue within this  Kruger National Park. The parties in this summit exchanged  presentations on their respective positions with respect to the  grave issues which are facing the country in the present  national crisis.    Unfortunately, progress could not be made with respect to  most of the fundamental issues tabled by his majesty the king of  the Zulus and by the Inkatha Freedom Party to which the leaders  and the delegations of the South African Government, National  Party and of the ANC, could not provide any responsive answer as  they still had to consult with their cabinet and with the  members of the working group through the ANC before responding.  The IFP upholds the summit to seek ways and means to reach a  constitutional compromise which could form the basis for a  broader political settlement and reconciliation which would  enable the IFP to join the electoral process on an equal footing  with all other political parties of South Africa. In this  respect the IFP felt that a postponement of the election date is  essential to achieve an all inclusive participation. Both his  majesty the king and the IFP also tabled the issue of the Shell  House massacre and of the most disturbing lack of police action  to secure evidence and ensure the conviction of those who  perpetuated that carnage. The issue of the sovereignty of the  kingdom of kwaZulu was tabled once again by his majesty the king  and the Zulu nation and an ANC proposal continued provisions to  be implemented by a government of national unity after elections  was found to be unacceptable by His Majesty and his delegation.  The issue of violence in the country and especially in the  kwaZulu-Natal area was discussed and the IFP tabled its firm  opposition to the declaration of the state of emergency in  kwaZulu-Natal and intervention of the SAP [South African Police]  and the SADF [South African Defense Force], which has already  proven to escalate the situation of violence and arrest in that  region.    The IFP insisted that the immediate lifting of the state of  emergency is a necessary precondition to the holding of free and  fair elections in the region. In order to seek compromise and  reconciliation the IFP tabled further proposals to reach a  constitutional settlement contained on pages five and six of the  presentation delivered by the president of the IFP. Such  proposals were not even discussed. International mediation  between the South African Government, the IFP, and the ANC was  also discussed and all parties stated their commitment to it.  In this respect the president of the IFP further proposed the  involvement of Norway in the mediation process, to which there  was no objection from the other parties.    That is a statement which His Majesty commanded me to read  to  you just now, and I must say that just like the state president,  I feel that although there may be that disappointment that there  has been nothing concrete as far as the expectations of many  people in this country and also outside this country are  concerned -- but nevertheless I do believe that the day was not  wasted. I believe that every minute that was spent in  addressing the issues of the king and the kingdom, in addressing  all the other issues that the state president has mentioned and  also issues that I mentioned, were well spent.    [Mandela] Firstly, I would like to say that the statement  read by the chief minister comes to me as a complete surprise.  I certainly was not informed about it before now. The  statement that has been distributed to the press was drafted by  committee representatives -- all the parties involved in this  discussion -- and I would have expected that if there was a  separate statement we should have been informed, warned about  this. The second point I want to make is that the IFP wanted the  date of elections to be postponed. We have emphatically  rejected that. That day is sacrosanct and there can be no  compromise over it whatsoever.    The third point I would like to make is that we would expect  the authorities in kwaZulu-Natal to give full facilities to the  IEC [Independent Electoral Commission] to deploy the voting  stations and to make all preparations for the elections, as has  happened in other parts of our country. There is no area in  which the IEC has encountered problems and we would appeal to  the authorities in kwaZulu-Natal to cooperate with the IEC.  Those who want to participate in the elections should be free  to do so and those who want to boycott the elections should also  be free to campaign for the boycott of elections, after all,  that is what democracy is all about. The only issue which we  (?are against) -- as we have done in our resolution, is the  question of seeking to obtain ones objective through the  employment of violence. We have harshly condemned these  massacres and called upon our followers to commit themselves to  peace and we have condemned all forces, including those that are  known and unknown which are responsible for this violence, but  we hope that the authorities in that area will give full  cooperation to the IEC in its work.    Now, we made certain proposals to his majesty, as the ANC,  in  order to meet his concerns. We went out of our way to address  everything which we believe a constitutional monarch would like  to enjoy -- the powers, the rights which are sovereign  everywhere in the world, in a constitutional dispensation,  enjoy. There is hardly any power in our view which we reserved,  except perhaps we were silent on the question of the right of  His Majesty to communal land and to indigenous law. When this  was pointed out to us we indicated that as the African National  Congress we are prepared to address this question because we are  keen that the fears and the concerns of his majesty must be  fully addressed and I will be going back to my organization to  point out that amongst the proposals that we made, his majesty  felt that this particular question of his rights in relation to  communal land and to indigenous laws is a matter which he feels  we should have addressed, and we will treat this with all  seriousness. This discussion with his majesty is going to  continue. We will address it if we are unable to resolve it  before the election. We propose to continue after the election.    Without going into details I do not want us to have  exaggerated expectations about the task group because the  reasons for the reservation that have been expressed -- his  majesty expressed a certain reservation about the proposals that  were made to him and in my view these are reservations which  cannot be properly addressed by a task group. They are  reservations which can properly be addressed by a government of  national unity. Nevertheless, I will not oppose any mechanism  which my colleagues and all the other parties involved think  might be useful, but I would like to warn you that we should  have no exaggerated expectations as to what this task group is  likely to achieve.    Now the issue of the powers, the rights, the privileges of  His Majesty, have nothing to do with the form of state. Whether  it is a federation, or a unitary state, or a hybrid state, his  majesty will enjoy the rights of a constitutional monarch, with  all ceremonial powers. I believe that you must have gone  through our proposals because they are now in the hands of the  press, and we believe that subject to the two issues on which  our proposals seem to be (?based), subject to those two, we  believe we have gone a long way to address the concerns of his  majesty. But the addressing of his concerns is totally  unrelated to the form of state and that is the spirit in which  we handled the affair.    Now in regard to the Shell House massacre, that was raised  by  His Majesty and I pointed out that this matter is now in the  hands of the Goldstone Commission and we better wait until that  commission has made a finding. We will then take up the matter  on the basis of the finding of the learned judge, and I believe  that we saw more or less eye to eye on this point. Now we are  unable to place before you any tangible results of these  discussions, but of course as you know the fact that we sat  together to exchange views is itself progress. We now know what  the concerns of his majesty are, what the demands of the IFP  are. We have responded to them. They know what our point of  view is and further discussions, therefore, will build on what  we believe the basis that was made and the proposals that were  made to his majesty are a basis for further discussion of his  position. The African National Congress is very much concerned  about the demands of his majesty. It is one of the most  illustrious royal houses in this country and we would like his  majesty to feel sure that we are proud of the achievements of  that illustrious royal house, and it is for that reason that the  ANC has gone out of its way in order to meet the fears of his  majesty, and we are, therefore, leaving the meeting in the  knowledge that we have tried our best to meet the concerns of  his majesty, and as I say the discussions between ourselves on  his position, and his majesty, will go on before the 27 April,  and if we do not reach a solution, those discussions will go on  after the 27 April, but I want to make sure there should be no  doubt, whatsoever, about the elections on the 27 April. As I  said elsewhere, we cannot postpone our freedom and we are  determined to set up a government of our own choice on that day  and I hope that everyone will understand why we are so  determined that the elections should take place as scheduled.    [Buthelezi] I just want to clarify one thing that Mr.  Mandela says, when he says that he was not informed about a  separate statement that I have made. I think the issue Mr.  Mandela has discussed very clearly and I think that it was Mr.  Matthews in our party who stated there was a time when we were  not, in fact, in favor of issuing part of a joint communique,  but then the state president said that there were issues in  which we had agreed, that in fact we all agreed -- it was sure.  We are making it very clear that each person has the right to  make their own statement. The fact that we have put down what,  in fact, is our point of view doesn't mean to say that there is  no right to state our own point of view, but I mean it wasn't as  if we were doing this secretly. I don't know whether, maybe,  Mr. Mandela could not have understood the argument. There are  some arguments about it when we agreed on this matter, and I  would also like to, and I would also like to say that as Mr.  Mandela has put it, the discussions have gone -- inasmuch as the  state president has stated -- but concerning, you know,  elections the head of state in this country, Mr. de Klerk, has  stated to you that in fact I have not deviated from all the  undertakings that I made to him previously, and in fact all of  you have got my statement which I have given to you and all of  you are aware of the fact that it isn't as if on our part we are  trying to, you know, to deprive the IEC of any facility that it  is within our competence and powers to make available, and  thirdly, I would say that when the king raised the issues that  he has raised about the sovereignty of his people, and also the  whole issue of the Zulu kingdom, you stated that if there had  been a federal state that we would never had raised the issue.    So that, therefore, I think that the issue arises precisely  because the issue of the federal state, the three of us -- I  think the president, the president of the ANC, and myself we are  not at the negotiation council, except that they attended of  course the Codesa [Convention for a Democratic South Africa]  plenary sessions, which I did not attend. But I would say that  the issues that the king has raised have a lot to do with the  self- determination of the Zulu people, that the issue is not  just a personal issue which his majesty the king raises, you  know, about himself and his person and his family. It's an  issue which he raises on behalf of his people as a whole, and if  the issue is not, actually sorted out, and he has pleaded that  it should be sorted out from January this year, when he spoke to  the state president, then it is a very problematic situation  because, therefore, I mean those of us, who may be members of  the IFP who are Zulu speaking will find it very difficult to  participate in the elections.    But I would like also to draw your attention to my statement  that I think I have made some very reasonable proposals because  the IFP intends participating in the elections, in fact we do  want to participate in the elections, and therefore, we made  some very reasonable compromises in an effort to try and have  this issue resolved before the elections because we do want to  participate in the elections. Now to say that when there should  be a government of national unity, and we should be called the  government of national unity, in which we are not part of -- I  think that of course is a misnomer because we cannot really be a  government of national unity in this country -- in which quite a  large segment of the people of South Africa are not represented.    So I just wanted to clarify those issues, and to say to Mr.  Mandela that there is no -- our meeting has gone on very  amicably and there was no tensions in the discussions, even  between us and that, therefore, there is no subterfuge, there is  no issue of us issuing a statement which was secretly (?drawn  up).

The company paid the fine and pleaded guilty to 10 of 22 charges in a plea bargaining agreement with the US Justice Department. The US and Japanese governments are lifting most of the sanctions imposed on JAEI last year when the offences came to light. The company was banned by the US from manufacturing defence-related products made under licence from US companies. The Japanese Defence Agency suspended contracts with JAEI. The US authorities plan to keep the company on a watch-list for three years, during which the export ban would be automatically reimposed if any suspected new offences were unearthed. JAEI is a world leader in aerospace navigation technology and if the bans had persisted, Japan's defence procurement programmes could have been disrupted. The company was charged with selling Iran navigation equipment for military jets which had been made under licence from US contractors. JAEI allegedly conspired with Aero Systems, a Florida-based company, to carry out the illegal exports in 1986. The sales contravened the US Arms Export Control Act. Mr Hisao Kaneko, the JAEI president, yesterday apologised to the defence agency, to other ministries and to clients for having caused a scandal which influenced even Japan's defence programme and the US-Japan security treaty. After the settlement, JAEI revised its corporate financial forecast. It expects a Y3.3bn pre-tax loss in the year to the end of March, more than the previous estimate of Y2.4bn. The results would be worse but for the sale of a Y3bn parcel of land.  The Financial Times   London Page 4  "

The scandal is no longer a personal and private  problem. It is beginning to paralyze the work and effectiveness  of the President. The latest decision by the Senate to  investigate the affair itself guarantees that Whitewater will be  playing several stages in the future and will thus become a  public spectacle. So far, the investigations have been in the  discreet hands of a special investigator who worked behind the  scenes.    The consequences of the fact that this affair is becoming a  crisis marathon: It paralyzes not only the President's political  effectiveness, it has now also deteriorated to the mud-slinging  spheres of a bitter quarrel between the parties, because this is  an election year in the United States. Congressmen are  struggling for their political survival. The congressional  investigation decided by the Senate yesterday thus unavoidably  moves into the sphere of uncontrolled political blows below the  belt.    What makes this development so painful is the fact that it  is  largely the fault of the Clintons themselves. Their often  incomprehensible crisis-containment policy threatens to  collapse, because for someone who does not have anything to  hide, as the Clintons have repeatedly insisted for months, they  have desperately built many defensive walls around them. In the  past they vehemently opposed the appointment of a special  investigator, and then had to give in. And, until yesterday,  they struggled with equal vehemence against an investigation by  Congress.    The ""back flip"" has become a familiar piece of crisis  gymnastics by Bill Clinton. His toppling over, his retreats,  and his contradictions in this conflict prove what became  obvious also in far more urgent and more important crises, such  as Bosnia, Haiti, Somalia, and China: This is a president who  is ill-advised.

And he  said that once the frame of reference of such mediation had been  set, he would personally be willing to start campaigning for an  election. The IFP Central Committee would decide on Friday  whether the party should provisionally register before the  Friday midnight deadline for the April election.    Addressing journalists and businessmen in Cape Town, Mr  Buthelezi said he had ""come to the end"" of the current  constitutional road. ""Only this international mediation might  open a new chapter,"" he said in answer to a question at a press  conference after he had addressed the Cape Town Chamber of  Commerce.    Mr Buthelezi revealed that the Freedom Alliance had, at a  meeting in Cape Town earlier on Thursday, accepted international  mediation in principle to resolve South Africa' constitutional  deadlock. He told the business luncheon -- at which he had  arrived about an hour late because of the Alliance meeting --  that he had ""just been told"" that the African National Congress  [ANC] working committee had also decided in principle there  should be international mediation.    Mr Buthelezi and ANC President Nelson Mandela agreed in a  joint statement after meeting in Durban on Tuesday that the  possibility of international mediation should be explored to  resolve outstanding constitutional deadlocks. Mr Buthelezi told  the businessmen on Thursday that the interim constitution, as it  stood, would give rise to the politics of violent recrimination  when it was found that ""it polarises South Africa and destroys  the prospects of producing the national unity in which there  will emerge the national will to establish a democracy and make  it work"".

The latest of these lies claimed that our heroic Armed  Forces  fired a missile on Aden, and that shrapnel from the missile,  which was exploded in the air by the so-called air defenses of  the rebellious, secessionist gang hit a number of worshipers in  Aden during dawn prayers.    This false and fabricated report, which aims at concealing  the crimes of this gang in a manner that exposes it, included a  statement by a citizen who was forced to speak on television and  said the explosion occurred while the worshipers were kneeling.  Another citizen said the explosion took place during the final  stage of prayers. A third citizen spoke about prayers while the  announcer was telling him what to say. At the beginning of the  report it was said that the missile was intercepted by the air  defenses of this gang and exploded in the air.    This disgraceful contradiction shows the lowly means  employed  by the media of the renegade secessionist gang in fabricating  deceptive reports and falsifying facts.    The source said the masses of our Yemeni people know who  shells mosques, and who tortured to death our esteemed religious  scholars, and who attacked Sanaa, Ta'izz and Zinjibar, as well  as al-Rahidah and 'Ataq with missiles, in addition to what  happened in the economic and commercial capital, Aden, in  January 1986 during the bloody coup against the legitimate  leadership of the Socialist party at that time.

Those who attended the meetings were members of the LDP's  panel on the Antimonopoly Law, including former Construction  Minister Kishiro Nakamura, as well as FTC officials headed by  former Commission Chairman Setsuo Umezawa, the sources said.    On several occasions at a Tokyo hotel and the headquarters  of  the LDP, then the ruling party, both sides discussed the size of  the maximum penalty and decided to raise it to 100 million yen  from 5 million yen, the sources said.    Nakamura, who was the panel's deputy chairman, is facing  allegations that he received 10 million yen in dubious  contributions in January 1992 from major construction firm  Kajima Corp.    The negotiations were reportedly tough since the LDP had  strongly opposed the FTC's proposal in 1991 to raise the penalty  to several hundreds of million yen. But when the meetings  started, the LDP relaxed its stance, the sources said.    They quoted one participant as suggesting that there must  have been an arrangement within the LDP on settling the issue  beforehand.    Nakamura reportedly acted as an agent of former political  kingpin Shin Kanemaru, who has been indicted on charges of  evading income tax on secret donations from the construction  industry.    Kanemaru and Nakamura are known for having close connections  with the nation's construction industry and have therefore  become the center of the current corruption scandal involving  the industry.    It has also been reported that Umezawa explained Nakamura's  role in a meeting with Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Nobuo  Ishihara.    After reaching the agreement with the LDP, the FTC announced  the 100 million yen penalty figure on March 12, 1992.     "

The financial subsidies from Bonn that  had been applied for and approved arrived much too late for its  startup. Not until the 800,000 German marks [DM] finally arrived  were the company founders able to decisively increase the tempo  of expansion, according to Friedrich Luecking, Parsytec's  marketing chief. Today, the manufacturer of parallel computers  has 150 employees and--only eight years after startup--sales of  nearly DM30 million. Sales specialist Luecking is certain that  without government money ""we would not have achieved such rapid  growth."" Other financiers--such as the big banks--kept aloof. At  the time, only the Aachen City Savings Bank granted the founders  of the enterprise a loan.    The experience of the Aachen electronics tinkerers is not an  exception. Whoever has ideas but no capital and wants to  establish a company in Germany has a rough time of it. Private  financiers are a scarce commodity, banks insist on collateral,  and government grants are to be landed--if at all--only after  nerve-deadening struggles with forms and long waiting periods.  It is understandable that Erich Haeusser, head of the German  Patent Office, laments: ""No one in Germany really risks capital  for innovations."" If, in the management suites of industry and  the banks, the people with reservations continue to maintain the  upper hand, according to the top guardian of patents, ""German  business and industry will be throwing jobs away.""    To date, it has been primarily too costly workers, sleepy  managers, and regulation-crazy politicians that have been held  responsible for Germany's malaise as a location for business and  industry. On the other hand, it was not only Mannheim economics  professor Wolfgang Buehler who consistently included the banking  system among the ""assets"" of Germany as a place to do business.  No wonder: The German financial houses have remained spared of  crises such as the savings and loan scandal in the United States  or the real estate debacle in Japan. Even during the deepest  recession the major banks in Frankfurt have achieved record  profits--proof for Manfred Weber, general executive manager of  the National Association of German Banks, of the ""stabilizing  effect"" of the universal banking system. Because German credit  institutions are permitted to engage in all types of financial  business and are allowed to accumulate undisclosed reserves  almost at will, they can consistently show profits.    But Ingo Walter, a professor at New York University and at  INSEAD [European Business Management Institute] in Fontainbleau,  believes that it is often the case that ""success is a sign of  failure"" because ""great stability"" has a reverse side to it--""a  lack of growth."" The cost to the German economy, according to  bank expert Walter: ""too high capital costs"" and ""too little  receptivity to innovation."" The close relationship between  credit management and industry--resulting from links to house  banks, equity interests, and directorships--that once made the  economic miracle possible, is now increasingly acting as a brake  on growth. Dieter Wolf, head of the Cartel Office, also lamented  during the latest hearings before the Economics Committee of the  Bundestag on the subject of ""the power of the banks"" that the  strong influence of the banks ""has a tendency"" to act in a way  that is ""inimical to innovation.""    Germany's managers have thus far not been heard uttering  such  sharp criticism--no one would like to ruin things with his house  bank during a recession. Yet when the Munich IFO Institute  [Institute for Economic Research] was commissioned by  WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE to sound out 702 companies, the managers, under  the protection of anonymity, dispensed with their reserve: Some  59 percent complain about too little competition among German  banks and 63 percent regard their willingness to undertake risk  to be too low when compared to international standards.    New York expert Walters believes that, in contrast to the  Americans, the British, and even the French, the Germans have  apparently not grasped the ""principle of diversification""--harsh  criticism since, after all, every economics student today learns  portfolio theory that teaches that a combination of speculative  investments can entail lower overall risk than the respective  individual risks. Yet the Germans, bank researcher Walter  observes, are still always looking at things on  project-by-project basis rather than looking at entire  portfolios. The unfortunate consequences: There is too little  risk capital for innovation and establishing new companies.    For all that, it looked in the 1980's as if the banks were  awakening from their lethargy. Under the sponsorship of  financially strong institutes, holding companies were springing  up everywhere. The successes in California's Silicon Valley  invited imitation: The average return on capital of American  venture capital companies reached 20 percent. The Germans tasted  blood and from 1982 through 1987 the volume of investments grew  from DM785 million to just under DM1.6 billion. When quick  success was not forthcoming, things went downhill again. Instead  of investing in risky, innovative projects, the holding  companies preferred to buy into established medium to  small-sized companies. Holger Frommann, managing director of the  National Association of German Financial Investment Companies,  does not like to use the terms ""venture capital"" or ""risk  capital"" any more because of their ""negative sound."" True  venture financing, according to Hans-Joachim Hass, chief of the  Economic Policy Department at the BDI [Federal Association of  German Industry], ""hardly exists any more.""    The extreme aversion to risk on the part of German banks has  proven to be particularly unfortunate for reconstruction in  eastern Germany. It helps little that Federal Chancellor Kohl  repeatedly makes a personal appeal for the promised ""bank  billions."" Bad consequences of the lack of risk capital: Most  east German inventors and companies are facing the threat of  losing their patent rights. Only 18 percent of former GDR  patents had acquired full legal patent protection by the end of  1992; the Patent Office estimates that about 50 percent of them  are usable, however, yet the money is only sufficient for the  registration of individual inventions. Consequence: For  companies, the innovative potential is lost.    Whether in the east or the west--there is enough money,  complains Klaus Bregger, chairman of the Christian Democratic  Union [CDU]/Christian Social Union [CSU] Association of Small  Businessmen, but it is just ""being put in the wrong place."" The  big banks have given ""the cold shoulder"" often enough to the  founders of software companies and biolabs: ""The banks are  lacking in expertise and intuition.""    The conservative predominance of the established money  houses  has created a climate that leaves little room for venture  capital. For the minority of risk-loving investors in Germany  there are few opportunities to invest in expanding companies  because young firms are a scarce commodity on the stock  market--underwriting is handled almost exclusively by the banks  and their creditworthiness requirements are far more stringent  than the legal regulations. Whereas more than 800 firms were  launched on Wall Street last year, precisely nine new companies  made it to the stock market in Germany.    Whether the Bonn government's plans for the registration of  a  ""small joint stock company"" can make a decisive difference  remains yet to be seen. No doubt about it: The German equity  market is underdeveloped and, in addition to restrictive  regulations and fearful investors, it is the leisurely banks  that are primarily responsible for it. Moreover, for a long time  foreign investors were not enthusiastic about Siemens,  Daimler-Benz, or Mannesmann stock because, in contrast to the  Anglo-Saxon world, the financial markets hardly play a role in  the control of companies in Germany.    Unimpressed by short-term capers, members of the board of  directors from banks and friendly companies saw to the  reconciliation of interests among workers, managers, and  shareholders. Yet what for a long time had been a ""mainstay,""  the British magazine ECONOMIST groused, is now developing into a  ""burden"" because the conflicts of interest are becoming  critical--the conflict between the desire of employees for  lifelong employment and that of shareholders for better return  on capital, for example.    According to American professor Walter, the scandal  surrounding the metal company [as published] causes doubts about  the German system to continue to grow. The very thing happened  in that case that bank participation on boards of directors was  supposed to prevent: ""The theory was good but the practice of it  was not very successful."" The New York economist hopes that the  affair of the metal company could--certainly in a way similar to  that of the insider scandal involving IG Metall [Industrial  Trade Union of Metalworkers] boss Franz Steinkuehler--initiate  reforms in the German system. The Federal Government's second  Capital Market Development Law, after all, provides for stricter  regulations concerning insiders and the establishment of an  independent regulatory authority for securities. Werner Seifert,  head of Deutsche Boersen AG [German Stock Exchanges, Inc.], is  citing the emergence of an ""equity culture"" in Germany. But  banking official Weber warns against ""exaggerated expectations:""  ""We have a long road ahead of us.""    Innovative company founders can hardly muster that much  patience and the call for state intervention is thus rapidly  becoming louder among Bonn economic policy makers: The CDU wants  to create tax breaks for high-tech investors, and Jenoptik chief  Lothar Spaeth wants to entice private investors, banks, and the  government to join together in a collective innovation fund--a  proposal that makes Minister for Economics Guenter Rexrodt  shudder. He is not at all in favor of the government ""jumping  into""--of all places--that most noble discipline of the free  market economy: the allocation of risk capital.    The Aachen Parsytec Company has already drawn its  conclusions  from the stunted venture capital market in Germany: It wishes to  sell shares on the stock market--not in Frankfurt or  Duesseldorf, however, but rather directly to risk-loving  investors--in the United States.

Central Committee spokesman T C Memela said the  pre-conditions were those outlined by the IFP last Friday, which  included: international mediation in the constitutional  deadlock; amending the interim constitution; and, mediation to  allow Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini to secure the interests of  his nation.    The Central Coomittee also wanted a rationalisation of the  electoral process and timetables to translate constitutional  agreements into a fair and free election in which all parties  could compete on an equal footing.    Mr Memela also said the ball was now in State President F W  de Klerk's court to extend the deadlines for registration of  parties and submission of candidate lists because he was  empowered to do so in terms of the electoral act.    He said the Central Committee wanted international  mediation to take place to assist in the resolution of  constitutional differences and the process of amending the  interim constitution. Mediation should also focus on whatever  steps King Zwelithini decided to take to secure the interests of  the Zulu kingdom.    Mr Memela said mediation was necessary on the question of  conflict resolution and investigation into criminal violence.  The Central Committee, he said, reconfirmed its commitment to  pursue the international mediation process with ""resolution and  urgency"".    Wednesday night's decision by the IFP is a reaffirmation of  its stance adopted ast week after a summit between the party's  leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi, and African National Congress  President Nelson Mandela in Durban.    There the IFP said it would provisionally register for the  April elections, and participation in the poll would be subject  to the success of talks in meeting its pre-conditions.     "
0,FT944-7861 ,"FT944-7861 _AN-EKWECABDFT 941123   FT  23 NOV 94 / Armscor finds a place in new South Africa: The close relationship has surprised most defence analysts      By MARK SUZMAN   President Nelson Mandela, one of the world's most respected statesmen, yesterday officially opened South Africa's first international defence show, a display of armour from an industry once aimed at thwarting the political movement he leads. The show is the first the country has held since the ending of the UN arms embargo in May. As air force aircraft and helicopters thundered overhead in honour of their Commander in Chief, Mr Johan Moolman, chairman of state-owned South African arms procurer Armscor, praised the government for its 'supportive role' in helping promote the domestic industry's aim of boosting its 0.4 per cent of the global arms market, worth about R800m (Pounds 144m), to 1-2 per cent. Mr Mandela was equally enthusiastic. Armscor, he said, had developed a strategic, home-grown technological base that would use its weapons sales to 'serve peace and security' rather than 'death and destruction'. The close relationship between the industry and Mr Mandela's African National Congress government has surprised most defence analysts, who had predicted the political movement would seek to dismantle or at least cut an industry that seems both incongruous and unnecessary in a post-apartheid South Africa. But Armscor has waged a successful public relations battle to win over the new administration, in part using a national advertising blitz that portrays it as a mainstay of South African industrial technology and an important foreign-exchange earner for the South African economy. 'A bee has a sting for its protection,' reads one typical ad caption, superimposed on a painting of a cuddly bee gathering pollen from a green and sunny hillside, 'South Africa has one too: Armscor'. Even the company's new slogan - 'Creating wealth, Protecting the Nation' - is adroitly designed to highlight both the industry's financial solvency and its strategic role. Mr Moolman claimed the industry, South Africa's largest manufacturing exporter, contributed R3bn a year to the economy and employed 70,000 people. Mr Joe Modise, defence minister, has long been a supporter of domestic arms manufacturers, but the government has until recently remained uncertain about backing them wholeheartedly. Mr Joe Slovo, housing minister, has reportedly urging they be scaled down. Now with Mr Mandela's official backing, Mr Modise appears to have won the day. Helping persuade the president is the fact that the industry has some genuinely competitive products to sell. Armscor was only formally created in 1977, just six months before the UN imposed its embargo, but has developed the successful G-5 and G-6 artillery pieces, generally regarded as among the world's best, as well as a range of sophisticated smaller arms and armoured vehicles. Responding to the changing political climate, in 1992 it was divided into two companies, with the rump Armscor becoming primarily a procurement agency and its manufacturing arm spun off as Denel. A Denel subsidiary, Atlas Aviation, has recently garnered much international interest with its Rooivalk attack helicopter. In line with South Africa's new international image as a model global citizen, the new Armscor has published a set of ethical principles under which its arms trade will be conducted. At the same time it has undertaken to make the trade more transparent by drawing up a list of all approved countries to which the South African industry will be permitted to sell. But even with official government support, it is not yet plain sailing. Already implicated in having sold arms to Iraq, Rwanda and the rebel Unita movement in Angola, Armscor is the subject of a judicial commission of inquiry following claims in September that it had sold 15,000 AK-47 rifles to a Lebanese arms dealer allegedly trans-shipping them to Yemen, a proscribed country because of its civil war. At the same time, officials in the defence and foreign ministries are unwilling to testify to the commission in open court about Armscor's past military relationships for fear disclosures about its secret dealings during the apartheid era will alienate many of South Africa's new allies. More important, because of an indictment served on Armscor and several other South African defence companies in 1991 by a Philadelphia grand jury on charges of illegal purchase of American defence technology during the 1980s, Denel is legally barred from doing any business with the US government or any American defence companies. This is a constraint proving costly in the European market where equipment compatibility with American norms is frequently a requirement in new weapons acquisition. But while the industry may not become the guarantor of peace Mr Mandela hopes, optimism is widespread that the exposition will boost the industry's international profile, and ethical controversies notwithstanding, Armscor's financial goals at least may prove achievable.

He was  given a standing ovation at the NP federal congress at Kempton  Park's World Trade Centre for a sharp attack on the ANC while  speaking in support of the NP's new election manifesto.    The ANC was not African or national or a congress, he said.  The ANC was an embarrassment everywhere in Africa because it  pursued policies which were no longer practiced anywhere on the  continent. ""They still call each other 'comrade', and African  leaders ask me why can't the ANC get rid of the past. It claims  to have international acceptability but, but by whom? They  confuse their acceptability with that of Mr Mandela who is a  martyr,"" he said.    ""They are not African because there is not one country in  Africa that propagates their policies. They are not national  but a conglomeration of converse foreign ideologies. They are  also not a congress but a conglomeration of confused people.""    The ANC also could not refrain from personal insults against  President F W de Klerk. In front of foreign governments and  audiences where Mr de Klerk was regarded as a man of integrity,  the ANC acknowledged this. But the moment the ANC addressed an  audience that ""lives in the past with a racist orientation"", Mr  de Klerk was reviled as a criminal and racist terrorist. ""There  was only one man who liberated South Africa -- not as a sign of  weakness -- and that is why he got the Nobel Peace Prize,"" Mr  Botha said.

Liberation claims to have discovered security service transcripts of 16 phone conversations from the home of Mr Edwy Plenel, an investigative journalist on Le Monde newspaper, between December 30 1985 and February 26 1986. Mr Plenel was at the time researching an article on the falsification of evidence by the security services to convict three suspected Irish terrorists. All three were later released. The newspaper did not disclose its source for the documents, which bore the signature of Mr Pierre-Yves Gilleron, a member of France's intelligence service and a member of the cell in charge of the president's security. Mr Plenel wrote in Le Monde that Mr Gilleron admitted to him having been ordered 10 years ago to investigate whether Le Monde and Liberation journalists working on the Irish case had been involved in any political activities. President Mitterrand's staff refused to comment on the Liberation article. Mr Pierre Beregovoy, prime minister, said he had no knowledge of the affair but expressed confidence that a law passed in 1991 had cleared up phone-tapping abuses. Mr Plenel said on French radio that he would take legal action. Under French law, the security services are only allowed to tap the telephones of suspected terrorists. Two prominent industrialists working for the government at the time both denied any knowledge of a bug on Mr Plenel's phone. Mr Louis Schweitzer, now chairman of Renault and then head of the private office of Mr Laurent Fabius, prime minister, said his policy was always to refuse requests to tap journalists' phones. The security services should have cleared all bugging requests with Mr Schweitzer. Mr Gilles Menage, now chairman of the EdF electricity group and then deputy director of Mr Mitterrand's private office, denied any knowledge of the alleged bugging.   Countries:-  FRZ  France, EC.

Notwithstanding differences on constitutional matters, the  parties recognised the right of people to participate or not to  participate in the forthcoming general elections.    After a constructive exchange of views, the parties agreed  to  work together to ensure that canvassing for respective views  should be able to take place without let or hindrance.    In an effort to resolve outstanding constitutional  deadlocks,  the parties agreed to explore with their principals the  possibility of international mediation and in this regard the  IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] would consider provisional  registration in terms of the electoral act.    Both parties agreed that the present levels of violence in  our society were totally unacceptable and were jeopardising  conditions for socio-economic reconstruction and development.    They therefore resolved to redouble their efforts to  encourage their respective constituencies to participate in and  support National Peace Accord structures and all peace  initiatives.    While recognising the fact that members of the ANC [African  National Congress] and IFP are involved in political violence,  the parties are of the view that the primary responsibility for  the maintenance of law and order remains with the government of  the day.    The parties also explored the possibility of making greater  use of international expertise in areas such as conflict  resolution and the investigation of political violence.    It was agreed that a task group would be established in  order  to faciliate the strengthening of peace committees and to attend  to communication between the parties.     "

The latest round of suits was filed Thursday by the state Department of Food  and Agriculture, the result of a wide-ranging investigation during the 1988  grape harvest. Shortages of premium wine grapes drove prices up for some  varieties last year, but prices of non-premium grapes remained moderate.    In several of the suits, the growers or harvesters are accused of passing off  cheaper French colombard grapes as Chardonnays, which sell for more than eight  times as much. In others, inexpensive red grapes were allegedly sold as  zinfandels. Both Chardonnay and a blush wine made from zinfandels have become  highly popular moderately priced wines in recent years.    ""There have been suspicions for some time that there were irregularities (with  grapes) from some growers,"" said Frank Indelicato, co-owner of Delicato  Vineyards in Manteca. ""But it's gotten real bad in the last two years. Some  people are trying to take advantage of the high prices for grapes.""    The extent of the problem is not yet known, but both federal and state  authorities are continuing their investigations. It also is not entirely clear  why some wineries apparently failed to detect the switch, or how much  mislabeled wine -- if any -- made it to the marketplace. Industry sources say  wine made from the grapes under suspicion was not of the expensive type, but  rather fell among those that typically sell for $5 or less per bottle.    Winery officials are clearly embarrassed by the situation, and some express  concern about the effect the scandal could have on the industry's image.    ""There are 6,000 honest, hard-working grape growers in California and a couple  of cases like this make all of us look bad, and that is causing a lot of  bitterness in the grape-growing community,"" said Jim Ledbetter, owner of Vino  Farms and president of the Sonoma County Grape Growers Assn.    Six civil cases have been filed so far by state agriculture officials, all in  the San Joaquin Valley where virtually all of the state's cheaper wine grapes  are grown. However, some of the allegedly inferior grapes or wine are believed  to have wound up at wineries in Napa and Sonoma counties -- the state's most  prestigious wine-producing areas, and federal investigators are known to be  looking into some suspicious cases at a number of premium wineries.      Wineries Victimized    The wineries themselves so far are not under investigation for switching  grapes, and are considered to have been the victims. However, sources said the  federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, a division of the Treasury  Department that regulates the wine industry, is checking to see whether some  wineries have mislabeled wine made from the suspect grapes.    It was also learned that federal regulators have demanded that a number of  California wineries show exactly what they did with any suspected misidentified  grapes or the juice produced from them. Winery officials said they are  cooperating.    Authorities want to determine whether wineries that bought misidentified grapes  or wine violated the federal ""minimum varietal content"" regulation. Federal  rules require that wine bottled with a varietal designation (Chardonnay, for  example, or white zinfandel) be made from at least 75% of that grape variety.    The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms has the authority to suspend the  license of any winery that knowingly bottles wine with a varietal designation  made from less than 75% of the named variety.      Private Suits Filed    At least three private lawsuits also have been filed. In one, brewing giant  Anheuser-Busch recently won an out-of-court settlement in Northern California  after it claimed that an Escalon, Calif., grape harvester had sold it  lesser-quality grapes labeled as premium zinfandels. The defendant agreed to  pay nearly $1.1 million to settle the case after a government inspection  determined that less than 23% of the grapes delivered to Anheuser-Busch were  actually zinfandels.    Industry officials insist that the situation occurred in only a few instances  in the San Joaquin Valley and could not happen in the premium wine areas (Napa,  Sonoma, Mendocino and Lake counties, for example) where wineries and growers  are closely linked by long-term contracts. ""These are smaller communities where  the growers know the wineries, people know each other, they eat together,  they're friends,"" a spokesman for the Sonoma County Wineries Assn. said.    By contrast, the San Joaquin wineries are typically much larger and process  huge amounts of grapes from many different growers.    Ev Delfino, assistant director of inspection services for the state agriculture  department, said evidence accumulated so far indicates that the problem was  localized in the San Joaquin Valley. ""The great majority of growers, 99 and  nine-tenths of them, are clean. There is no large-scale misidentification of  wine grapes.""      Warning Issued    Since about 1987, when the state's supply of Chardonnay and zinfandel began to  dry up (in part because of a small harvest) and prices rose dramatically, the  state has suspected that some grape growers and brokers might take advantage by  selling cheaper grapes and passing them off as more costly varieties. In fact,  the state Department of Food and Agriculture issued a public warning to growers  and wineries early last year.    State Assistant Atty. Gen. Mark Urban, a prosecutor in the six cases filed so  far by the agriculture department, said the state is seeking a total of more  than $1.2 million in damages, including penalties.    Another six suspicious instances have been referred to the attorney general's  office for possible prosecution, according to sources familiar with the  investigation. (There is a one-year statute of limitations on grape-switching;  all the cases filed so far refer to actions that allegedly occurred last  summer.)    In four of the six cases already filed, Bavaro Brothers, an Escalon-based grape  harvester, and its owners, Nick J. Bavaro and Francisco Bavaro, among others,  were named as defendants. A secretary said that on the advice of its lawyers  the company would not comment on the cases.      Zinfandel Producer    Buyer of the grapes in three of the Bavaro cases was Delicato Vineyards,  believed to be the state's largest white zinfandel producer and purchaser of  80,000 tons of California wine grapes last year. Delicato sells much of its  production -- 4.2 million gallons last year -- in bulk to other wineries,  including Sutter Home, the state's largest marketer of white zinfandel under  its own label.    In one case, the Bavaro firm is alleged to have sold French colombard grapes,  which sold at a statewide average price of $138.79 per ton in 1988, as  Chardonnays, for which the statewide average was $1,122.36 per ton.    In other cases, the state alleges that lower-priced carignan, valdepenas and  grenache grapes were sold in different transactions and passed off as  zinfandels. There was a difference of about $600 per ton in the price paid for  those types of grapes last year.    Winery owner Indelicato said vintners cannot always tell the type of grapes  they are receiving, and therefore must rely on the representations of their  suppliers.    ""Even when we have suspicions, and we call the county (agricultural)  commissioner over, some of the grapes are sent to (the viticulture laboratory  at UC) Davis, and sometimes even professionals can't tell for sure. Just  looking at the grapes, it's hard to tell. You have to analyze the seeds.""    Bob Steinhauer, viticulturist for Beringer Vineyards in the Napa Valley,  agreed. ""The three of us who buy grapes for Beringer inspect the vineyards to  make certain that it's what the grower says it is. And we have a map on file of  every vineyard we buy from, showing the varieties,"" Steinhauer said. ""When the  grapes are on the vine, it's fairly easy to tell what's zinfandel and what's  not. But it's harder to tell when the grapes are in the gondola.""    Sebastiani Vineyards in Sonoma and Charles Krug in the Napa Valley, both  premium wineries that bought grapes from the Bavaro firm, have filed lawsuits  against it claiming that the grapes were misrepresented; each suit seeks $1  million in damages. Both wineries said discussions are under way to settle  those cases.      'A Small Minority'    ""This does not represent the entire wine industry,"" said Robert Hartzell,  president of the California Assn. of Winegrape Growers. ""It's a small minority  of growers.    ""This is an extremely unusual situation. . . . In the 12 years I've been  president of (the grape growers), I've almost never seen the state need to step  in.""    Hartzell said some growers do not believe that the state is being tough enough  on the wrongdoers. ""They think the perpetrators' hands aren't being slapped  hard enough, that the penalties should be more severe. Both growers and  vintners are deeply concerned that a few greedy people have misrepresented the  varieties.""    The last time a scandal of this type hit the California wine industry was  nearly 20 years ago when Almaden Vineyards, then located in San Jose, allegedly  mislabeled wine that it sold to airlines. That case was settled out of court.    Some wineries are upset that the authorities were slow to warn them that a  significant amount of misidentification was occurring. In some cases, the  warnings came after the wine was already blended with other wine. That means  large quantities of wine could be suspect if it were labeled as varietal.    A spokesman for Lost Hills Winery in Acampo said the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco  and Firearms was slow in telling wineries of its concerns, ""and we never knew  until we had blended our tanks. . . . They should have told us. We could have  held onto that wine until the percentages were certified. Now it's too late.""      WINE INDUSTRY -- CALIFORNIA; CONSUMER FRAUD; GRAPES; SUITS; BAVARO BROTHERS  (COMPANY); DELICATO VINEYARDS; LABELS    "," LA061089-0051   68393    June 10, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition      Part 1; Page 1; Column 1; Metro Desk      1662 words      GRAPE-SWITCHING SCANDAL ROCKS STATE WINE INDUSTRY      By DAN BERGER, Times Wine Writer      The California wine industry's worst scandal in two decades has come to light  in recent weeks as state authorities have accused a number of grape harvesters  of selling inexpensive varieties as premium wine grapes.    The latest round of suits was filed Thursday by the state Department of Food  and Agriculture, the result of a wide-ranging investigation during the 1988  grape harvest. Shortages of premium wine grapes drove prices up for some  varieties last year, but prices of non-premium grapes remained moderate.    In several of the suits, the growers or harvesters are accused of passing off  cheaper French colombard grapes as Chardonnays, which sell for more than eight  times as much. In others, inexpensive red grapes were allegedly sold as  zinfandels. Both Chardonnay and a blush wine made from zinfandels have become  highly popular moderately priced wines in recent years.    ""There have been suspicions for some time that there were irregularities (with  grapes) from some growers,"" said Frank Indelicato, co-owner of Delicato  Vineyards in Manteca. ""But it's gotten real bad in the last two years. Some  people are trying to take advantage of the high prices for grapes.""    The extent of the problem is not yet known, but both federal and state  authorities are continuing their investigations. It also is not entirely clear  why some wineries apparently failed to detect the switch, or how much  mislabeled wine -- if any -- made it to the marketplace. Industry sources say  wine made from the grapes under suspicion was not of the expensive type, but  rather fell among those that typically sell for $5 or less per bottle.    Winery officials are clearly embarrassed by the situation, and some express  concern about the effect the scandal could have on the industry's image.    ""There are 6,000 honest, hard-working grape growers in California and a couple  of cases like this make all of us look bad, and that is causing a lot of  bitterness in the grape-growing community,"" said Jim Ledbetter, owner of Vino  Farms and president of the Sonoma County Grape Growers Assn.    Six civil cases have been filed so far by state agriculture officials, all in  the San Joaquin Valley where virtually all of the state's cheaper wine grapes  are grown. However, some of the allegedly inferior grapes or wine are believed  to have wound up at wineries in Napa and Sonoma counties -- the state's most  prestigious wine-producing areas, and federal investigators are known to be  looking into some suspicious cases at a number of premium wineries.      Wineries Victimized    The wineries themselves so far are not under investigation for switching  grapes, and are considered to have been the victims. However, sources said the  federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, a division of the Treasury  Department that regulates the wine industry, is checking to see whether some  wineries have mislabeled wine made from the suspect grapes.    It was also learned that federal regulators have demanded that a number of  California wineries show exactly what they did with any suspected misidentified  grapes or the juice produced from them. Winery officials said they are  cooperating.    Authorities want to determine whether wineries that bought misidentified grapes  or wine violated the federal ""minimum varietal content"" regulation. Federal  rules require that wine bottled with a varietal designation (Chardonnay, for  example, or white zinfandel) be made from at least 75% of that grape variety.    The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms has the authority to suspend the  license of any winery that knowingly bottles wine with a varietal designation  made from less than 75% of the named variety.      Private Suits Filed    At least three private lawsuits also have been filed. In one, brewing giant  Anheuser-Busch recently won an out-of-court settlement in Northern California  after it claimed that an Escalon, Calif., grape harvester had sold it  lesser-quality grapes labeled as premium zinfandels. The defendant agreed to  pay nearly $1.1 million to settle the case after a government inspection  determined that less than 23% of the grapes delivered to Anheuser-Busch were  actually zinfandels.    Industry officials insist that the situation occurred in only a few instances  in the San Joaquin Valley and could not happen in the premium wine areas (Napa,  Sonoma, Mendocino and Lake counties, for example) where wineries and growers  are closely linked by long-term contracts. ""These are smaller communities where  the growers know the wineries, people know each other, they eat together,  they're friends,"" a spokesman for the Sonoma County Wineries Assn. said.    By contrast, the San Joaquin wineries are typically much larger and process  huge amounts of grapes from many different growers.    Ev Delfino, assistant director of inspection services for the state agriculture  department, said evidence accumulated so far indicates that the problem was  localized in the San Joaquin Valley. ""The great majority of growers, 99 and  nine-tenths of them, are clean. There is no large-scale misidentification of  wine grapes.""

The disclosure was made yesterday by Mr Henry Gonzalez, the Democratic chairman of the House banking committee who has been investigating US-Iraqi relations in the context of the scandal over Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.32bn) of improper Iraqi loans made by the Atlanta, Georgia office of Italy's Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL). Mr Gonzalez yesterday released declassified secret documents from the National Security Council, which he said provided proof that the Bush Administration engaged in a policy of permitting intelligence sharing between the US and Iraq until May 1990. Mr Gonzalez said he had forwarded the documents to the Senate intelligence committee, which last October, in its own report on the nomination of Mr Robert Gates as director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), stated: 'Intelligence sharing continued on a sporadic basis until 1988 when the Iran-Iraq war ended.' Mr Gonzalez termed the Senate report 'misleading'. The documents include an Iraqi options paper prepared for a White House meeting in May 1990 by Mr Gates, then deputy national security adviser to President Bush. A section entitled 'intelligence co-operation' notes that intelligence exchanges had waned since the ceasefire between Iran and Iraq of 1988. In favour of continuing such co-operation the argument is made that 'they still provide Iraq with limited information on Iranian military activity that would be missed.' The section goes on to state: 'Ending this contact would close off our very limited access to this important segment of the Iraqi establishment.' A Congressional investigator said the Gonzalez committee had received independent confirmation of US-Iraqi intelligence sharing that went beyond the documents released.

C. Tsai]    [Text] Taipei, May 20 (CNA) -- The prosecutor's Office of  the Taipei District Court's Shihlin Branch on Friday [20 May]  indicted two arms dealers on bribery charges in a major arms  procurement scandal involving much of the navy's top brass.    Prosecutor Chen Jui-jen said that Cheng Cheng-kuang and Liu  Shu of the Hsih Kuang Co., the Taiwan agency of an Italian arms  supplier, were charged with violating the Corruption Punishment  Act.    The two arms dealers were accused of offering and paying  bribes to two navy commanders who eventually helped the Hsih  Kuang Co. win a bid to sell a reconnaissance ship to the navy,  Chen noted. If convicted, Cheng and Liu will face up to seven  years in prison.    In addition, Liu, Hsih Kuang's president, was indicted for  embezzling NT [New Taiwan] $2.5 million in company funds --  money which Cheng wanted to use to bribe a navy officer. He  would face an additional five years in prison if convicted of  the charge.    This is the first time indictments have been brought against  civilians involved in the arms buying scandal, which came to  light last December after the body of navy Captain Yin  Ching-feng was found floating in the sea off Taiwan's  northeastern coast. He was murdered before he could disclose  corruption surrounding the award of lucrative military contracts.    In mid-April, military prosecutors indicted captain Kuo  Li-heng, a navy weapons procurement officer who has been in  custody since late last year, for corruption and leaking  military secrets.    Kuo will be tried by a military court and will face either  the death penalty or life in prison if convicted. He was  charged with taking bribes totaling NT$12 million (US$446,096)  offered by civilian arms dealers in exchange for military  secrets.    Adm. Ku Chung-lien replaced Adm. Chuang Ming-yao as navy  commander-in-chief a month ago after Chuang stepped down as a  show of responsibility for the affair.     "

Its proudest  moments, however, would not fall under the title ""The Great Escape.""    There was the rare, 600-pound African antelope that thundered across a golf  course.    There was the jaguar that skittered between a keeper's legs and caromed toward  the exit, its claws clicking on the concrete.    And there was the orangutan that left for a stroll, only to surrender -- to  everyone's goggle-eyed amazement -- to a keeper's outstretched palm.    Those were one-shot escapades, easily squelched. Now, however, a pair of  Malaysian sun bears at the zoo appear to be out to break all records, and to  possess the savvy of Houdini when it comes to escaping.    Shortly after 3 p.m. on Sept. 23, the 100-pound Ringo climbed over a wall and  ended up on the patio of Sun Bear Forest. Onlookers apparently thought it was  part of a show and made an attempt to cozy up to Ringo, who was just trying to  act naturally.      Third Sun Bear Escape    Ringo's was the third escape by a sun bear since the animals' new $3.5-million  exhibit opened in June.    Muffin, Ringo's female playmate, escaped the two other times.    The bears' antics have zoo officials worried, so much so that a guard has been  posted at the exhibit during visiting hours.    ""Every time these bears get out it's a problem -- and a potential grave hazard  -- for zoo visitors,"" zoo spokesman Jeff Jouett said with furrowed brow. ""We  can't seem to convince the public that, although small, these animals are not  Yogi Bear or Winnie the Pooh. Sun bears have the ability to do a lot of damage  to human beings.    ""They have big claws for digging and teeth that could easily deliver a big  bite. We face the dual hazard of a person or a bear getting hurt, and then the  very real possibility of incurring a major lawsuit. So, yes, we're worried.""    Escapes notwithstanding, the bears have managed to do considerable damage to  the exhibit, Jouett said, which has the theme of ""native habitat."" What  zookeepers hadn't counted on was that the cute little bears would gnaw down  every tree in sight, along with plants and grassy slopes, and destroy a $25,000  fiberglass ""tree"" with an automatic honey dispenser.    Jouett said the zoo resisted using electrical wiring, but, as it turns out, the  bears' claws do not conduct electricity, which keepers didn't know.    He said the bears are ""intelligent, curious"" animals with ""a ferocious climbing  instinct.""    They're just more intelligent, more curious and better at climbing than anyone  at the zoo thought they could be.    Sun bears weigh 60 to 150 pounds, Jouett said, and the eight on exhibit in the  1 1/2-acre Sun Bear Forest average about 100 pounds. The bears bear a vague  resemblance to large dogs, especially those of the hound variety, the kind  former President Lyndon B. Johnson might have picked up by the ears.    So far -- and Jouett said the zoo is ""incredibly fortunate"" to be noting this  -- the escapes have not resulted in injuries to the bears or the passers-by who  find them so irresistibly cuddly and charismatic.    On Sept. 23, however, Ringo had to be felled by a tranquilizer gun, which  Jouett said poses problems, the likes of which the zoo hopes not to encounter  again.    ""You never know quite what dosage to give the animal because every animal is  different. An animal gets out, its adrenaline is racing, and that affects the  dosage you select. The instinct of such an animal would be fight or flight once  it escapes. Luckily, Ringo chose flight. Otherwise, some people could have been  hurt -- seriously.""    Zookeepers have installed sheet metal behind a row of bars in the area where  each escape took place. They're hoping the metal will prevent claws from  wrapping around the bars to gain traction. The ""visitor assistance officer"" is  now on duty during zoo hours to make sure no further escapes occur or to  minimize damage if any do.    Jouett said the conventional way of housing bears is in a ""sunken grotto."" The  zoo had hoped to alter that by having onlookers gaze up at the bears, rather  than down -- ""not quite so condescending,"" he said -- and offering a kind of  minimum-security setting to such creatures of the wild.    But the strength and boldness of sun bears, particularly those on view in San  Diego, have baffled and awed the experts. And now, Jouett said, the zoo may be  inclined to ""rethink"" the nature of Sun Bear Forest.    ""It's like if you designed a human exhibit,"" he said.

He pointed out that he is  unfamiliar with the stance Tunisia will adopt, pointing out that  this is a matter of principle for Morocco.

He stressed that the UN  settlement plan stipulates conducting the referendum in this  province, and that the OAU can not take part after it has  determined the future of the province by accepting the  membership of the so-called Saharan republic. It is only when  this imaginary entity has been brushed aside that Morocco will  see no reason for the nonparticipation of the OAU, because by  doing so it will have adopted a logical stance.    In this respect, he affirmed that Morocco's relations with  the African countries have never been as good as they are now,  since withdrawing from the OAU.

Kenshi Yonehara, head of the LDP's Kumamoto chapter, said in  an interview that he does not know whether the money was part of  the 100 million yen Hosokawa said he borrowed from the  scandal-tainted Sagawa Kyubin Co. around that time. Yonehara  said he received the money in December 1982 from a senior member  of the chapter who had worked to put Hosokawa on the LDP ticket  for the election in February the following year.    Yonehara said the 1 million yen was handed over after the  LDP  approved Hosokawa as its official candidate in the race,  reversing the initial decision to field then Gov. Issei Sawada  as the party's candidate. Hosokawa won the election and served  for two consecutive four-year terms until February 1991.    Hosokawa has said that he borrowed the money in September  1982 to buy a condominium in central Tokyo and repair his home  in the prefecture in western Japan, and repaid it by January 31,  1991. The premier has insisted there were no illegalities in  the loan.    The LDP, ousted from 38 years of unbroken rule last August  by  the coalition administration of Hosokawa, and the Japanese  Communist Party have been holding up debate on the budget in the  Diet by demanding Hosokawa submit detailed documents on the loan.    The opposition has also demanded Hosokawa's former secretary  testify before the Diet on the affair, which had stalled Diet  deliberations on the fiscal 1994 budget for three weeks.    Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin Co., a now-defunct member of the Sagawa  Kyubin group, was embroiled in a money scandal involving  gangsters and political figures, including fallen LDP kingpin  Shin Kanemaru, who was charged with tax evasion last March.

By TED ROHRLICH, TIMES LEGAL AFFAIRS WRITER      Although many defense lawyers shouted their outrage when a jailhouse informant  scandal broke last year, surprisingly few have accepted invitations from the  Los Angeles County prosecutor to challenge murder convictions that were  obtained with informants' help.    Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner's office said it has sent invitations to defense lawyers  in 142 cases that resulted in convictions in the last decade.    Defense lawyers so far have taken steps to challenge convictions in only 13 of  the cases.    Prosecutor Antonio Barreto Jr., a member of a four-person team organized by the  district attorney's office to handle an expected mountain of litigation,  commented: ""There was an awful lot of noise at the beginning, and very little  action.""    Gerald F. Uelmen, dean of the law school at the University of Santa Clara,  characterized the defense response as ""disappointing. I'd go further and say it  may be cause for alarm if it indicates a wholesale abandonment of clients by  their lawyers.""    Prosecutors and defense lawyers, in interviews, suggested many reasons for the  small response, ranging from lawyer laziness, to incompetence, to a belief that  appeals would be futile because informants played only a small role in some  cases in which there was ample other evidence of guilt.    In addition, many attorneys cited a belief that they had no ethical obligation  to represent former clients.    Nearly a year after the scandal broke, there is no agreement on the number of  cases in which jailhouse informant testimony figured. The district attorney's  office, which now says the number of cases involving informants in the last  decade is 142, has, at various times, put the number at 175 or more. The Los  Angeles Criminal Courts Bar Assn., a predominantly defense lawyer group, has  placed the number at 240. Almost all are murder cases.    Patricia Nelson, an attorney at the Los Angeles office of the California  Appellate Project, which finds and supervises lawyers to handle appeals for  indigent felons, said she has identified about 170 defendants who now have no  lawyers because their appeals have been denied. The overwhelming majority of  their former lawyers have declined to try to reopen cases.    Nelson said many of these lawyers have a false expectation that some other  agency, such as the Los Angeles County Grand Jury, will look to see whether  injustices have been done. But former California Supreme Court Justice Otto  Kaus, who is acting as special counsel to the grand jury on informants, has  said repeatedly that he is not looking at individual cases -- only at possible  patterns of law enforcement misconduct.    The office of the state public defender, which is the other main source for  representation of indigents in appeals of their criminal convictions, said in a  letter last March that it was ""unable to participate"" in informant litigation  on closed cases.    Chief Assistant State Public Defender Edward H. Schulman said in the letter  that his agency had identified eight of its cases that involved informants and  were still on appeal. Schulman said the agency would investigate the  possibility of litigating in formant questions in those cases, but warned that  his appellate lawyers had ""very little expertise in the handling of the kinds  of evidentiary hearings which may be contemplated.""    His comments highlighted another persistent problem: While many trial lawyers  are unfamiliar with the highly technical procedural steps necessary to try to  reopen an old case, many appellate lawyers, who earn their livings by reviewing  transcripts and writing briefs, are unfamiliar with walking into a courtroom to  question witnesses.    There is no tradition of close cooperation between the two types of criminal  defense lawyers.    Leslie Abramson, president of the statewide defense lawyers lobbying  organization, California Attorneys for Criminal Justice, offered yet another  reason for the lack of response. Abramson, a trial lawyer, said she has not had  a chance to pursue her own informant case and probably will not for some time.  ""People . . . have to decide if that's the stuff they're going to work on when  they have tons of other stuff happening,"" she said.    Uelmen, the law school dean, suggested still another reason, ""the absence of  'Mr. Green.' "" ""Mr. Green"" is a criminal lawyer's expression meaning money.    Money is available to pay the lawyers, although some lawyers do not know it.  David Horowitz, the supervising judge for criminal matters in Los Angeles  Superior Court, has said that he would appoint lawyers to represent their own  imprisoned, and presumably impoverished, former clients at public expense.    Of the 13 cases in which defense lawyers have taken action, eight have involved  the filing of papers. These cases are at early stages. In the other five case,  lawyers have asked the district attorney's office informally for additional  information before deciding whether to file papers.    Another dozen or so defense lawyers have indicated that they may take action.    No convictions have been overturned.    Reiner invited the defense attorneys to contest the cases after a veteran  informant, Leslie Vernon White, demonstrated for his jailers in October of last  year that he could convincingly fake another inmate's murder confession.    White, a convicted robber and kidnaper, showed how he could feign having talked  to an accused murderer he had never met by gathering inside information about  the murder from law enforcement agencies. To gather the information, White used  a jail telephone and posed as a law officer.    His demonstration raised the possibility that he and other informants had  perjured themselves about confessions in return for leniency in their own  cases, and that, as a result, innocent people had been convicted.    In the wake of the demonstration, the district attorney's office began  centralizing information about White and other informants it had used.    It quickly became apparent that the district attorney's office had been so  disorganized that its prosecutors had not disclosed to the defense, as they  were required to do, all the negative information the office had on informants  it had used.    This failure to disclose raised the possibility that some defendants had not  gotten fair trials, in that their attorneys had not been given adequate chances  to discredit informants in front of judges and juries.    Typically, jailhouse informants testify that they have heard confessions from  other inmates, in exchange for leniency in their own cases. Terms of the  leniency were sometimes not disclosed. Nor were other cases in which the same  informants had testified.    Deputy Dist. Atty. Frank E. Sunstedt Jr., a member of the team of prosecutors  organized to handle litigation arising from the informant scandal, said his  team has found a a pattern of non-disclosure.    He said there was nothing nefarious about this. It was merely inefficiency  related to the office's size. With 800 lawyers, the district attorney's office  is the largest local prosecutor's office in the country. Until the informant  scandal broke, any prosecutor had authority to use an informant and might do so  without the knowledge that other prosecutors had also used him.    A U.S. Supreme Court case on the subject, Giglio vs. the United States,  however, says size of the prosecutors' office is no excuse for failing to  disclose critical information to the defense.    In that case, the court granted a convicted forger a new trial because the  government had failed to disclose an alleged promise of leniency to a key  witness in return for his testimony. The court said that even though the  promise was made by one prosecutor without the knowledge of the prosecutor who  tried the case, the prosecutors' office was at fault.    Defense attorneys who handled cases in which White figured as a prosecution  witness received letters from Reiner calling attention to this sort of problem.    The letters said the district attorney's office had learned that ""at the time  Mr. White testified as a prosecution witness . . . information existed that you  may not have been aware of, which might adversely reflect upon Mr. White's  credibility. As a result, you may not have been able to thoroughly develop  evidence which might have been used to impeach the testimony of Mr. White.""    Defense attorneys who handled cases in which other informants figured received  letters which said that the district attorney's office did not know whether the  informants ""acquired information in a manner alluded to by Mr. White"" in his  demonstration. ""However, since the courtroom is the appropriate forum in which  to fully explore this issue, our office will join with you in expediting the  hearing of any appropriate motion you may wish to bring.""    In the months since those letters were written, stacks of files that should  have been disclosed to trial lawyers, but were not, have piled up at the  district attorney's office, unexamined by defense lawyers.    In apparent repudiation of its earlier promise to expedite hearings, the  district attorney's office has fought those few defense lawyers who have filed  motions seeking the additional information.    Prosecutors said that defense attorneys are welcome to look at the district  attorney's files if they make an informal request. But prosecutors said they  feel that they have to oppose formal requests. They said they fear establishing  a precedent by which defense lawyers could file discovery motions in death  penalty cases as a way of postponing executions indefinitely.    Defense lawyers Gigi Gordon and Gerald Chaleff are the only ones who have won a  formal discovery motion in an informant case. Gordon said that informal  discovery would have been insufficient because the district attorney's office  was only offering to show its own files, and not the files of other law  enforcement agencies that might have critical information about an informant.    The district attorney's office, joined by the state attorney general's office  and the county counsel's office, has appealed the trial court ruling granting  post-conviction discovery in Gordon's case.

Chief Buthelezi was addressing about 3,000 supporters at a rally in Thokoza, the township at the heart of much of the recent violence, which has seen Inkatha supporters pitted against the ANC. Echoing a similar call made by ANC leader Mr Nelson Mandela when he visited the area last week, Chief Buthelezi said: 'I say to IFP members and . . . supporters that they must find common cause with ANC members and. . . supporters.' Chief Buthelezi made no mention of when Inkatha might return to constitutional talks which it walked out of on July 2. The Inkatha central committee is expected to make a decision on Saturday. Like Mr Mandela, Chief Buthelezi yesterday accepted that political leaders themselves had to do more to stop the violence. He said it was not good enough 'for us as black leaders when we fail to stop the violence and turn around to blame it only on the ineffectiveness of the security forces'. He stressed, though, that violence would not stop without the efforts of the people on the ground. 'When that will does not exist, no peace-keeping force and no dispute resolution committees will ever be able to function properly.' Although his tone was more emollient than recently, this did not stop Chief Buthelezi repeating his call for the disbandment of Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK), the armed wing of the ANC. He said the absorption of MK into the Defence Force, or into the recently mooted multi-party peace-keeping force was a 'total prescription for disaster'.   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.

It falls short of even the mediocre, with little attempt to relate the proposals put before the electorate to macroeconomic goals, especially economic growth and the reduction of unemployment. Yet Brittan himself is not above criticism on the score of shallow thinking. Why is it that economists of his persuasion straying into labour market analysis refuse to reconstruct themselves on the basis of the evidence? His 'consenting adults' model is catchy but pure fiction. Low-paid workers generally remain in their condition because labour markets are segmented. They have no realistic possibility of improving their pay and conditions given limited employment alternatives and the overwhelming bargaining advantage of their employers. To perceive this as a voluntary bargain between even approximate equals is a nonsense. Intervention to redress this imbalance can be via government or collective bargaining. Neither of these is perfect, but while they may lead to some negative consequences for employment, research also suggests some positive benefits for productivity. A particular example of this is the minimum wage which has been well researched in the UK both in its wages council and single national minimum forms. For its social as well as its economic implications it is important to address with some seriousness the scandal of widespread and endemic low pay and poverty in employment. Samuel Brittan's casual blackboard theorising will not do.
