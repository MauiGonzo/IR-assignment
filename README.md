the first commit is based upon an example that comes with the bm25 implementation found here (https://pypi.org/project/rank-bm25/) furthermore use the csv out from Lars. please note I changed the indices a bit. I don't think that has been updated on the drive as of this moment.
be aware of the shear size of processed csv output
